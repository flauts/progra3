title: Salvatore Giuliano
synopsis: The body of Salvatore Giuliano is found in a courtyard in Castelvetrano on July 5, 1950. Various figures are in the courtyard as the head doctor shouts out his examination of the body. The carabinieri and press arrive.The action flashes back to 1945, as exposition explains the existence of a Sicilian Separatist movement that gained strength around the time the allies handed Italy back in Feb, 1944. They were known as the EVIS (The Sicilian Army of Independence). They enlisted anyone to terrorize their enemies, bandits, mafiosi, and Salvatore Giuliano - who treated the Italian police and carabinieri as occupiers. They also fought leftists, communists, etc., who were making inroads with the people. The action continues as the EVIS leadership seeks out Salvatore in one of his hiding places. Another name used for him is Turridu which was what he was known as to distinguish him from his father. They want to offer him the rank of colonel and the battle flag of EVIS. In addition, once independence is attained, his name will be cleared. He killed a carabiniere and went into the mountains when he was 21. Don Pietro di Borgetto tells the EVIS representatives that Turiddu (Giuliano) is expecting them. He gives an impassioned speech about Sicilian separatism with beautiful pans of a Sicilian landscape at twilight. A sequence shows how lithe and adept Giuliano's men are in town, sneaking about. At night, the police come out of a building in town and are shot down. Giuliano's men surround an isolated post and open fire on it. The men inside come out with their hands raised. We see Giulinano just at the edge of the frame for the first time. He is wearing a white shirt. Four policemen drive along the road and are fired upon. The jeep crashes. The survivors shoot back at their attackers.Action resumes in present day - The casket actually contains Salvatore - we are in the present day. A glib army officer gives an account of Giuliano's death, and the press is not placated.Flashback. Giuliano and his men were protected by their positions in the mountains. On the other side of Sicily, the eastern side, the separatists were easily defeated in 1946, although the head of Montelepre is still in charge. Giuliano's men see the arrival of military policemen in the town. They are there to find Giuliano. The townspeople go inside their homes and close their shutters. The carabiniere major goes to see the town's mayor. Two policemen begin patrolling the streets in broad daylight when they are shot down by automatic weapons fire, guerrilla warfare style. One of the policemen eventually dies. A curfew is declared. The soldiers are stunned by this early loss. The drummer goes through the streets announcing the curfew. The communication between the villagers and the bandits works with whistles and closing of shutters etc.,The next morning, we get our first shot of Gaspare Pisciotta, Salvatore's right-hand man in black with Salvatore in white on the top of the hill. Pisciotta is the Judas of the story, but that has not developed yet. The military police start marching up into the mountains, but are not good with the terrain, despite most of them probably being WWII vets. Giuliano's men open fire on them. The military guys soon retreat. They fire some artillery shells at the outlaws, but they just scurry into the hills.The town crier announces that the people have one hour to get their water and shop for food. Mostly women come out, but some older men too. Soon they are fired upon and they have to scatter - by whom I'm not sure.In May 1946, Sicily was granted its independence, although the independence isn't as great as one might assume. To this day they are an autonomous region with probably less freedom from Italy than a state in the United States has. It was really done to vent off the anger. The bandits are now in respectable clothes, who go to see a mysterious lawyer. They have a letter of introduction to him from another mysterious character, a prince. They believe that all of their crimes should be pardonable as political crimes, a strategy that will be in use at the upcoming trial. The lawyer says that Giuliano is still staying in the mountains. He says the separatists were never going to keep their promises to Giuliano. The lawyer says Giuliano was an idiot to believe them in the first place. Giuliano will be an outlaw in the streets until the police catch him.The outlaws are now in the business of kidnapping shopkeepers and merchants at the behest of the mafia. They kidnap a man. After the dissolution of EVIS some of the money would go to Giuliano, but quite a bit of the money went to the Mafia for protection.The police continue with their random searches of people. They stop townspeople from taking water and food stuffs up to the mountains to the outlaws by confiscating the goods. They want to starve him out. He was being supplied by the desire for Sicilian independence, and now that that's gone, the police see him as a common criminal. The whistling signal in heard and relayed down to Montelepre. They are signalling the arrival of the troops. A man awakens Donna Maria, Giuliano's mother. She awakens her son. He gets up quickly and goes outside. He escapes with Pisciotta into the hills and they see the trucks rolling in. A little later soldiers go into the house. They also start rounding up a lot of the men in the town. Many of the women cry to see their men taken away. They want to staunch the flow of supplies to the town, and therefore Giuliano.The police gather the men in the piazza. They call out the names of quite a few of the townsmen. These people are going to Palermo. One of the men asks: Marshal, how long will we have to pay for the sin of being born in Montelepre? The other townsmen shout their approval of this observation.A woman runs down the streets of the town shouting murderers!' The police are informed that the women are rebelling and they take two squadrons to block of the main street going into the town square.Back forward in time The mother of Salvatore Giuliano moans over the loss of her son. The photographers take photos of her. The mother is allowed to see the body of her son. She cries over the body.Flashback 1947. In the first election for an autonomous Sicilian government, the People's party is victorious, espousing agrarian reform and the occupation of feudal land.Giuliano recruits a goat farmer. And, finally, he sends the shepherd out to fight alongside the others. The men learn that on May the first, May Day, tomorrow, they are going to Portella della Ginestra to shoot communists. Actually, to this day, it is unknown who ordered the massacre.The communists are having a big parade and a speech. All of a sudden gun fire breaks out coming from the mountains. The people start running for their lives. People are killed, including women and children. This incident sent a chilling message that no one was beyond the reach, even politically, of Salvatore.The shepherd is interrogated at police headquarters and issues firm denials that he knows anything, or anybody.Back to the present - after death. July,1950, Salvatore Giuliano's tombstone. His mother is paying respects at the tombstone. Police are seen going to Pisciotti's family home in the center of Montelepre.Flashback 1949 Pisciotti's mother is trying to protect him. The police search the house.Back to the presentThere is a trial held for those accused of killing communists at Portella della Ginestra. A large number of accused outlaws appear in court behind bars. The shepard testifies he knows nothing, and knows nobody. The next witness says that the police beat the confession out of him.The judge says it all started going bad on June 13, 1950 with the arrival of Giuliano's memoir in court in which he claimed that all the picciotti were innocent and their statements made under duress.With other outlaw witnesses, the judge asks them directly who fired the shots at Porto della Ginestra. One of the men says that when the time is right, he will talk. Later in the court case, this same man stands up and says he can name some names. In front of the judge he says he knows the names of three men. He is in violation of the code of omertà, or silence from the authorities. He was in an earlier scene performing a kidnapping. He heard the names from Terranova, who heard it from Giuliano. Terranova is called to the stand. When the cooperating witness gets back to the docket with the other defendants, they suddenly attack him. Meanwhile, Terranova throws himself on the floor and acts like he has gone absolutely bonkers. After considerable struggling, the court is finally brought back to order.Gaspare Pisciotta now decides to talk. He says the Giulilano memoir that the judge has is completely false. Giuliano was forced by the police to write it. He says in the false version of the memoirs, Giuliano omitted the names of the men behind the massacre at Portella della Ginestra, thereby destroying his comrades' lives. He says that's why he killed Giuliano. The real memoir, he claims, has the names of the influential politicians behind the decision to attack the communists.(Gaspare) Pisciotta also says that since 1947 he was a collaborator with the carabiniere. The police gave him a free pass to come and go as he pleased. He claims that all the defendants were loyal servants of the separatists and monarchists. And now the big politicians are all in Rome, while the little guys are all here. He says an unholy trinity was formed between the outlaws, the police and the Mafia. To prove it he asks the judge to subpoena Gen. Luca. On December 23, 1949, General Luca met with Giuliano. The carabiniere also contacted the Mafia and the two sides made an agreement to cooperate with each other. And now it's difficult, if not impossible, to determine what the Mafia was responsible for and what the carabiniere were responsible for.A man testifies that a high ranking police force officer (member of the commendatore) apparently offered to get Giuliano and Pisciotta out of the country. The fact that the memorandum was destroyed hints at a major conspiracy.Flashback. - A quick scene back in Sicily shows that the authorities had to cooperate with the mafia, working through an intermediary.We meet Nunzio Mirafiori in the screenplay, but probably a representation of Giuliano's treasurer, Benedetto Minasola, a mafioso. He talks with the marshal. He says Giuliano is becoming a problem for him and he will he provide the carabiniere with one of the four men around Giuliano, Franco Mannino. The four need to be gotten rid of before they can get Giuliano. Nunzio says that the carabiniere have to catch Giuliano.Mannino emerges from the mountains and is heading to down to meet some friends as he was told by the mafioso. The carabiniere officer is seen in the background as if from behind bars. He is grabbed by the outlaws and held. He spits in the face of the retreating Don Nunzio.Nunzio tells the marshal that now they need the other three and Giuliano. The marshal says he just may let Mannino go.Two of the men are lured into a way of hiding by the marshal to lure Giuliano out. They are suspicious, but really have no choice. The police marshal has to lock up the truck with the bandits away in the truck. Now he emerges from his house at night, where Giuliano is now dressed in dark clothing at the left of the frame. Nunzio knows that Giuliano dare not kill him because he is still behest to the mafia.Now a cut to Nunzio, demoralized and isolated in rock quarry, with Pisciotta cocking his rifle and laughing. But the don (Nuzio), turns him around with his eloquence. He convinces Pisciatta that Giuliano basically has his back to the wall, and the carabinieri are stronger than the police - his days are numbered, and he should betray Giuliano.A setup has been arranged so that Pisciatta can see the cabiniere arriving to capture Giuliano. At this point, he has decided to double-cross his leader.Guilano is visiting his attorney, De Maria, in Castelvetrano. He is portrayed as an owlish, intellectual type. He has provided cover for both of them. Pisciatta has decided to kill Giuliano. The carabiniere actually want him alive so they can immobilize him and get to the bottom of who was behind the massacre. Pisciatta calls out for Turiddu - (Giuliano's other name). Giuliano says he's not coming and gives Gaspare a note from an informer. The note says that Gaspare has made a deal with the carabiniere. Gaspare laughs and asks: And you believe it? - a very nervous and unconvincing laugh. Supposedly, in real life, Giuliano accepted this explanation and fell asleep.Outside the carabiniere have a diversion where they have to tell a man who has come out into the street to fan himself to go back into the house. He lights a cigarette, and three shots go off. The carabiniere rush over to the building. Gaspare comes out and says that Giulilano is up there wounded. De Maria is cowering at the top of the stairs. The carabiniere go in but find that Giuliano is actually dead. Now they wonder what are they going to do. They tell the landlord to get them Giuliano's clothes. They get the clothes and they dress Guliano in them. A military policeman drives Gaspare back, but Gaspare takes control and kicks the policeman out the the car. He proceeds on alone.The military police bring the body to the spot where it will eventually be found. They stage the scene carefully. Then one of the carabiniere fires off an automatic weapon toward the body. This provides an explanation for the opening scene of the movie, where the doctor is announcing the details of the body affirmatively.Present day At the court they ask the landlord of Giuliano if he knows where Giuliano's memoirs are to be found. The landlord says he knows nothing about the whereabouts the memoir. The judge wonders if Gaspare took the memoir from Giuliano.Gaspare speaks up and says that as of July 1950 Giuliano no longer had the memoir. It had been given to the man they called the little lawyer. He also says he introduced the carabiniere to the little lawyer. There are references to the little lawyer that, to this day, are not explained. The carabiniere have the document now. Gaspare says he can't give the judge the name of the man.The court reaches it's decision on May 3rd, 1952, almost two years after the murder of Giuliano. A number of the defendants such as Gaspare, Terranova (Pisciotta's closest colleague), Mannino, Francesco Pisciotta, Cucinella and several more have been found guilty of the May 1, 1947 massacre and are sentenced to life in prison. Pisciatta gives an explosive speech where he yells about the injustice given to him because he saved the life of the carabiniere colonel.In prison Gaspare is poisoned to death, probably for collaborating with the police. One of the outlaws shouts out the news for everyone to hear that Gaspare is dead and the inmates make a lot of banging sounds to announce their approval.In 1960 Coda - Nunzio (in real life, probably Benedetto Minasola) is murdered at a horse market. A message that treachery will always be punished.

title: I Married a Monster from Outer Space
synopsis: The movie opens with title and credits shown with the Earth over a star field background. We zoom in on the Earth, and then fade to a pastoral scene of a park with a lake in the small town of Norrisville. A car drives up a two-lane road and pulls into the parking lot of the local bar and restaurant, King's. Two men exit the car and approach the entrance and we hear music coming from inside. They see a man and woman necking in a car. Five drunk men sit at a table. It is a bachelor party of sorts for Bill Farrell (Tom Tryon). He is getting married the next morning, so he leaves early. Sitting next to Bill on his right is his friend Sam Benson (Alan Dexter) and on list left is Mac Brody (Ty Hardin as Ty Hungerford). He reminds Bill that seeing his fiancé before the wedding is bad luck. Harry Phillips (Robert Ivers) jokes that Bill is such a nice guy, It's a shame it has to happen to him. Bill gets in his car and drives off to see Marge. He drives along the lake and sees a body in the middle of the road and stops. He gets out of the car, sure he hit a person, but there is nothing there. He observes, I didn't think I had that much to drink. A strange, glowing arm with three pointed fingers touches his shoulder. Bill turns around and recoils at the sight of a very strange humanoid alien (an uncredited Charles Gemora). Bill sinks down along the front fender of the car to the ground and is enveloped in a dark, billowing cloud. When the cloud disappears, so does Bill.It is morning and we are in the wedding chapel. Mrs. Bradley (an uncredited Mary Treen), the mother of the bride enters the room with flowers and humming the Wedding March, much to her daughter's annoyance. Marge (Gloria Talbott) is anxious as Bill has not arrived for the wedding. Bill walks in and apologizes for being late. After the ceremony the couple exits the Wee Kirk Wedding Chapel and gets in the car. The well-wishers throw rice. Marge throws the bouquet and Helen Rhodes (Jean Carson) catches it. She wants to marry Sam and intends to soon, if she can get him to the altar. As Bill and Marge drive past the lake the alien watches them. Bill almost hits another car on the road. He forgot to turn on his headlights. When Marge innocently asks about the mishap, he snaps at her. They arrive at their honeymoon hotel near the ocean. Bill forgets to open the door of the car for his new wife. She tells Bill, I know you've been absent-minded lately, but you can't have a honeymoon without a bride. They share glasses of champagne. A storm brews outside as the couple prepare for bed. Marge is starting to think something is strange with her new husband. Marge goes inside and Bill stays outside to watch the storm. A flash of lightning reveals it isn't Bill, but a hybrid of Bill and the alien he encountered on the highway.One year later Marge composes a letter to her mother. She complains that she is both frightened and bewildered. Bill isn't the man I fell in love with. He's almost a stranger. Marge decides not to send the letter. Sam and Ted Hanks (Chuck Wassal) are sitting in a bar and talk about not seeing Bill Farrell any more. Sam gets his coat and tells the bartender, Max Grady (Max 'Slapsie Maxie' Rosenbloom) that he is a home-wrecker. Sam starts to walk home, but he feels ill and wanders into an alley to puke. He hears a strange noise and turns to investigate. He falls backwards in shock and is enveloped in a roiling black cloud, and like Bill, when the cloud disappears, so does Sam.Marge looks at an X-Ray of herself and complains, That doesn't look like me at all. She is meeting with Dr. Wayne (Ken Lynch). She saw the doctor to find out why she hasn't been able to get pregnant. The doctor admits he and his wife, Doris, took five years to have their first child. Before Marge gets out the door, Dr. Wayne asks, Why don't you have Bill come in and see me. Marge stopped at a pet store and placed the cage in her car. A car honks its horn and pulls up behind Marge. Helen Rhodes pulls up with Sam Benson. She announces she and Sam are to be married. Marge drives home and gets the cage out of the car. Bill is outside and calls to her, spoiling the surprise. She pulls the cover off the cage and the dog growls at Bill. The dog snaps at Bill when he puts his hand near the cage. Bill tells Marge that perhaps dogs don't like him, but she reminds him he's had dogs all his life. Bill tells Marge to put the puppy down in the basement. Later that evening Bill goes into the basement. The dog is just as aggressive. Bill reaches out to the dog and kills it. Marge runs to the basement to check on the noise. Bill tells Marge the puppy is dead. When Marge asks how, Bill lies and tells her, Well, he must have strangled himself. I think his collar was too tight. Marge tells Bill she saw Dr. Wayne today. She tells him she wants children and Bill should see the doctor. The doorbell rings. Marge answers it. It is Sam and he wants to see Bill. They talk briefly, and Marge excuses herself and walks upstairs. Alone, Sam reveals himself to Bill. He asks Bill, Did you make many mistakes at first? Sam admits he likes the pleasures humans enjoy, despite the stupidity, bad design and short life span. Sam finally gets to the point, They've improved the methane reservoirs in these bodies. You're due to report to the ship tonight. Sam reveals his alien/human hybrid face.A police car pulls up a street and stops. Officer Schultz (Jack Orrison) asks his partner, Officer Frank Swanson (Peter Baldwin) if everything is ok. They see a drunk in the alley and go to investigate. Swanson hits Schultz, and then he and the drunk carry him out of sight up against a wall. The cloud envelopes Officer Schultz. It is clear now that many of the men in town have been abducted. After checking on his wife, Bill leave the house. He is unaware that Marge has seen him leave. She grabs a coat and slips it on over her nightgown. She follows her husband. The sound of a screeching cat draws her attention. Bill wanders back to the ship with Marge closely behind. She follows the sounds of foot falls in dry brush and spots Bill. She sees a black vapor exit her husband and an alien materializes. The glowing alien walks into a spaceship. Bill remains standing and Marge walks over to him. He is unresponsive and when she touches him, he falls backward, his eyes staring into space. Marge runs. She wakes in the gutter in town. She is drawn to the noise in the bar. She tells Max Grady the Bartender she just saw a monster. Sitting and leering is Weldon (James Anderson) and he instantly takes an interest in Marge. He thinks she is drunk or having the DTs and comments to Max, Funny thing. She didn't look like a lush. Francine (Valerie Allen), the town hooker walks over and talks to Weldon, but he expresses no interest. Marge stops two policemen (Swanson and Schultz) in their car and asks to see Chief Collins (John Eldredge). Collins offers her a cookie and pours her a cup of coffee in his office. He listens sympathetically and assures her she is sane. But he doesn't believe in the aliens invading the Earth. He convinces Marge to go home and pretend everything is fine. He asks Swanson to take Marge home. Collins walks over to the window. A flash of lightning reveals his true nature. At home, Marge walks slowly into the living room. Bill is there, in the dark, and turns the lamp on. They walk upstairs.It is Sam's wedding day and the rehearsal is underway. Bill is acting as Best Man, and Marge is the Matron of Honor. Marge asks to speak to Helen. Marge begs Helen not to marry Sam, not today, but sometime later. Marge is not specific, and Helen ignores her suggestion. Bill walks in to tell Helen she is needed outside. Weldon has Marge Farrell's address and walks over to her house. Inside, Marge is looking for a lighter. She asks Bill why he isn't drinking. Bill comments that Marge has changed over the last few weeks. She avoids his presence, and his touch. Bill looks out the window and see Weldon. Suspecting something, he mentally summons Officers Schultz and Swanson to the house. They confront Weldon and arrest him. Weldon admits he's been sniffing around Marge. He pulls out a gun and shoots Swanson point blank three times. Schultz cold cocks Weldon. He asks his partner if Weldon is any use to their cause. Frank shakes his head, no, so Schultz kills the man with his service revolver. The shot wakes Marge. She and Bill talk, he admits he's learning. Bill leaves the house. Francine is on the move at the bar. Bill, Sam and Harry sit and stare at their drinks while they talk. They discuss pretending to be human. Harry thinks they are disgusting, but Sam admits he like them. Sam reveals the ultimate goal of their visit to Earth, Look, Harry, our scientists are working on a way right now to mutate human female chromosomes so we can have children with them. Max notices the three men haven't touched their liquor and confronts them. He hits Bill twice, but Bill is unfazed and responds by putting his hands in his pockets. Max is surprised and a little scared. Max stares at his bloodied knuckles. Francine decides to leave the bar. She adjusts her nylons, then saunters down the street. She sees a hooded figure staring into a toy shop display window. She tries to attract a potential customer by asking for the time. The hooded figure refuses to answer Francine. It finally turns to face her and she is shocked. She runs away screaming. The figure points a weapon at her, fires, and she disappears into a glowing mass.Several couples are enjoying a picnic in the park. Ted Hanks teases his wife, Caroline (an uncredited Darlene Fields) about her throwing arm. Helen and Sam are out on the lake in a row boat. Sam falls overboard, and Ted comments, Oh, he can swim like a fish. Marge notes that he is not swimming. Ted dives in to rescue his friend, while the rest of the men stand and stare. Helen dives in after her new husband. On shore, Doctor Wayne gives Sam oxygen, but instead of reviving him, it seems to kill the man. Helen spends the night with the Farrells and Marge checks on her before walking downstairs. She goes back to see Capt. Collins. Collins warns Marge about her delusions. Marge tries to call Washington, D.C. on a pay phone, but can't get through. She walks over to the Western Union office and talks to Mr. Potter (an uncredited Tony Di Milo). She fills out a telegram form to the FBI, pays the fee and walks away. She sees, through the window, that Potter tears up the form. She tries to drive out of town but is stopped at a road block. Swanson claims the road was washed out.At home, Marge sits on the couch in the dark. When Bills asks her, How about some light? She tartly replies, You don't need any. She finally confronts the Alien Bill and tells him, I know you're not Bill. You're some thing that crept into Bill's body. Something that can't even breathe the same air we do. Sam died because oxygen was forced into his lungs. Bill tells Marge he comes from a planet in the Andromeda Constellation. Their sun became unstable so they built a fleet of space ships to get away and that all their females died. He reveals their plans to breed with human females.Marge reveals all to Dr. Wayne. He believes Marge and comes up with a solution for finding human men. He needs help. Ted walks over to announce his wife delivered twins. Dr. Wayne recruits the men waiting in the maternity ward. Marge returns home. Bill is waiting in the living room. The posse of men arrive on the road to the field where the spaceship is located. One man, Charles Mason (Steve London) brings his hunting dogs. They take the path and fan out to search. Bills calls Chief Collins on the phone to inquire about his wife. Bill easily knocks down the door to their bedroom. The posse approaches the ship. A strange detector, a series of pipes and cylinders, scans the area. As Bill shakes Marge, demanding to know who she spoke to, he senses the approaching danger to his ship. In fact, all the alien imposters know and respond to the danger. Bill tells Marge, So your friends are attacking our ship? The ship opens and a couple of aliens exit. Bill gets into the police car and returns to his ship. Dr. Wayne and Mason fire at the aliens, but bullets enter, and the wounds instantly seal up. The posse retreats, but Mason releases his dogs. One of the dogs pulls the aliens breathing tube off. It bleeds from the wound, and the creature falls to the ground. The other dog attacks an alien in a similar fashion and the alien is also killed. The men return and stare at the alien body that disintegrates into a pile of gel-like goo. A small explosion destroys their ray gun. The posse enters the ship. Suspended above the floor are the real humans. They are attached by wires to small machines on the floor. Collins, Bill, Sam, and the two police officers are along one wall. Five more men are on another wall, and they include Harry and Mac. Dr. Wayne concludes, Electrical impulses from the real human bodies must give the monsters form and shape, even memories. Dr. Wayne disconnects Officer Schultz and his corresponding alien falls to the ground and turns into the gel-like goo in clothing. As Dr. Wayne disconnects more humans, more aliens are stopped. Alien Bill realizes the mission has failed. Alien Capt. Collins reports on a battery shaped device, Earth mission has failed. They're alerted and dangerous. Suggest continuing on to another galaxy. Total personnel lost. With his human plug pulled, Alien Collins collapses in his office. He finishes his report, Destroy scout ship. He then collapses and turns into the gel-like goo. As the posse removes more men, Marge approaches the Alien Bill. He tells Marge, Your people have won. That makes you happy, doesn't it? Bill's plug is pulled and his alien counterpart collapses and writhes in pain. His body turns into a Jello-like goo. The real Bill calls to Marge. He smiles and they embrace. The ship explodes, and Marge and Bill embrace. We close with a scene of the Earth in space and a fleet of flying saucers traveling away.

title: Lucky Number Slevin
synopsis: The opening credits for Lucky Number Slevin are shown as if entries in ledgers, as indistinct voices are heard relaying play-by-play for a horse race. A telephone is shown in a hotel room.Bookie Slim Hopkins is walking toward his car. Just as he leans over to open it, a bullet from behind sends his head through the door window and kills him. The legs and feet of the assassin are shown standing on a small platform being elevated toward the top of the garage. As Slim lies dead beside his car, someone takes his ledger.The opening credits continue in the same format, as the same indistinct voices relay more play-by-play on a horse race.Two men are bringing a third into the office of bookie Benny Begin. The two men frisk the third and tell Begin that he is clean. Benny puts away his gun in his desk drawer and asks the third man why he is here. The third man slowly removes his eyeglasses and stealthily plucks off one of the ear rests. The exposed hinge has a needle-like point suitable for puncturing flesh, and the third man uses this to stab and kill the two guards. Begin scrambles to recover his gun, but the man has snatched a baseball off of a bookshelf beside the door. A fastball pitch worthy of Nolan Ryan is hurled right at Begin's face, slamming between his eyes and killing him. The killer takes Benny's ledger.A scruffy man (Sam Jaeger) walks into a waiting room at a bus terminal, which is currently deserted except for a homeless woman sleeping across two of the chairs. The scruffy man is pulling along a wheeled suitcase, preparing to go on a trip. He sits tiredly and nods off as he waits.Without his noticing, another man, identifying himself as 'just Smith' (Bruce Willis), is suddenly sitting beside him in a wheelchair. Smith says to the scruffy man, 'There was a time' and says he's in town because of a 'Kansas City Shuffle.' The scruffy man doesn't know what this means, and Smith says it's a maneuver where you get everyone to look right, and then you go left. A bit impatient, the scruffy man says he hasn't heard of it. Smith says it's not something people hear about; it falls on mostly deaf ears. Smith's shuffle is twenty years in the making, or so he claims, and that it requires a lot of planning, and a lot of people, connected by the slightest of events long forgotten by those people. And it all began with a horse.Smith's voiceover explains his 'Kansas City Shuffle' as the events begin showing on the screen. (A caption shows the events begin at the Aqueduct Race Track in New York back in 1979). The starting event was known back then as a drugstore handicap; doping up a horse with performance-enhancing drugs to increase its chance of winning a particular race. The vet called in to administer the drugs, however, had loose lips, and carelessly spills the beans to a young blonde prostitute named Gloria who he has sex with. After the vet falls asleep, Gloria quietly calls another john of hers named Abe and tells him about the horse in question. Abe tells a friend of his at a nightclub as they are being served drinks, and the waiter overhears. He wastes little time telling his nephew, Max (Scott Gibson), a working-class man longing for a better life for his wife and their young son Henry.Max takes Henry to what Max's wife assumes is a baseball game, and they have a cover story arranged about the results of said game. Henry even wears a baseball glove in which he holds a baseball. In reality, Max is going into Aqueduct to bet on the 'fixed' race. Because Henry is a young boy, he has to wait in the car. Max assures him the race is a sure thing and will pay for his college education at Harvard. Next week, Max tells Henry, they'll go to a real ball game. Max gives Henry his watch; Max is supposed to spend no more than 15 minutes inside the track.Max watches with butterflies in his stomach as the race progresses. Coming into the final turn, he is elated to find that the seventh horse, the doped one he bet on, is taking the lead from the outside. He nearly jumps for joy as the horse makes a final rush toward the finish line. But that joy turns to sick horror as the horse suddenly collapses a mere few lengths short of the finish. Smith's voiceover then explains that Max is now in very serious trouble...Because the race was a 'sure' thing, Max made a dangerously bold move, placing a bet of twenty thousand dollars with a bookie named Roth (Danny Aiello). Roth is very suspicious of Max; the amount of his bet alone stands out like a sore thumb to a seasoned bookie like him. He refuses to accept the given odds on the horse Max is betting on, telling Max he will get no better than two-to-one. The bet has a 'juice' or interest rate of ten percent, meaning Max will be 22 thousand in the hole if the horse doesn't win. Furthermore, Roth will need to 'lay off' Max's bet, placing the bet with other bookies more capable of handling such large gambling bets. The bookies in question work for very dangerous men, and Max owing them money, especially in the sums discussed, is the very last thing Max will want, as Roth warns him. Max insisted to Roth he can cover the bet.But as Max returns to the parking lot in a daze, he finds that twenty-two thousand dollars is the least of his worries. His car, and young son Henry, are missing. As he frantically calls out Henry's name, two men approach from either side, and suddenly grab Max and sap him out cold.Max awakes in a basement, tied to a chair, his face bloodied. Two men pace around near him, one wearing a ring with a square face; another holding a shotgun. As Max desperately tries to tell the men that Roth will explain everything, a car parks at a curb, a shotgun resting on the passenger seat.Two other men slug Max's belly and tell him that Roth already did 'explain' everything to them: Roth's dead corpse, the chest and stomach riddled with bullets, sits slumped on the floor off to Max's right. As Max begins to plead for his life, the driver of the car picks up his shotgun and exits-- and in the reflection of the driver's window is an apartment building looking very much like Max's. He approaches the fire escape and begins to climb its stairs.Henry stands outside Max's car which is parked in what appears to be a desolate field. A man in a tan suit stands behind him. Max's wife, doing dishes in her kitchen, smiles as the door to the fire escape opens, but a man she does not recognize, whose face is unseen, stands in the doorway and levels a shotgun at her breast. Max's wife drops her dishes, looking bleakly at the man, knowing she is about to die. At the same time, the man standing behind Henry out in the desolate field points a gun at his head, cocking the hammer.A plastic bag is jammed down over Max's head as he continues to plead frantically. Heavy duct tape seals the plastic in an airtight lock around his neck. A gunshot rings out and blood spatters across a child's sketches taped to a wall.The scene returns to the bus terminal's waiting room as Smith's story finishes. The scruffy man is dumbstruck, though he doesn't understand why Max's family was killed. Smith says it was a new outfit in town, who had learned that the race was fixed and a very large bet had been placed with their bookies on the doped-up horse, and decided to make 'an impression.' The scruffy man asks if this is the Kansas City Shuffle that Smith alluded to. Smith says it is merely the inciting incident. He points off to one side, saying that was the Shuffle. The scruffy man turns, seeing nothing there, and then turns back to Smith-- who is no longer in the wheelchair, but standing behind him. Repeating the phrase that 'they look right, and you go left,' Smith grabs the scruffy man and breaks his neck, killing him.Smith puts the man's body in the wheelchair and pushes it, thereby looking inconspicuous. He pushes the wheelchair with the body into the cargo hold of a white truck, driving it off.The scene switches to two well-dressed men stepping out of an exclusive building in Manhattan. The younger of the two men is gunned down with a single expertly-placed gunshot as his guard scrambles to try and spot the shooter.Back in the hotel room, the phone begins to ring.Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) wipes steam off a bathroom mirror as he finishes up shaving. Slevin is nursing a broken nose. As he wipes the remaining shaving cream off his face, a pounding knock is heard at his door. Clad only in a towel, he goes to answer the door, the pounding not abating even though he calls out he is coming. He opens the door and a young woman named Lindsey (Lucy Liu) quickly walks in, unruffled at finding that the man standing before her is not 'Nick.' Slevin makes a curious remark about Lindsey having a 'deceptively tall knock...' the sound of her pounding on the door echoed in a way that sounded like it was hitting high on the door, so Slevin thought she was much taller than she turned out to be.Lindsey asks what happened to Slevin's nose. He says he was hit by someone-- and he was expecting it. He begins to tell Lindsey a story of bad things happening in threes: first he lost his job, then came home to find out the building where his apartment was, had been condemned. He went to the home of his girlfriend Kelly, and walked in on her having sex with another man.So Slevin flew into New York to spend some time with a good friend of his-- Nick. After the flight landed, he was talking to Nick on his cell phone when a man started walking beside him and asked him for a smoke, then demanded his wallet, and punched him in the nose, breaking it.Lindsey notes that this is four bad things, not three. She also notes that the mugger didn't take Slevin's suitcase (Slevin says, 'it was heavy') or his watch, which looked fancy (the mugger asked Slevin for the time). Slevin changes the subject by getting her to tell him her name. She asks where Nick is, and Slevin says he hasn't showed up yet; he was supposed to meet Slevin at the apartment. The door was unlocked, so he let himself in.The phone rings, and Slevin answers it, but the caller hangs up. Lindsey quickly dials call return, then claims she has a wrong number and tells Slevin the call came from the Hotel Cheval. Now that she knows who the man called, she says it's time to find out who called him. She begins to quote Columbo (to Slevin's amusement) to explain her 'detective work.' She places another call and gets the same hotel. Lindsey thinks that Nick is in trouble, and the mysterious caller, calling the hotel and the hotel calling him back, might be a clue.Suddenly Lindsey announces she has to stop by work and rushes out of the apartment, but having forgotten the cup of sugar she came to borrow, hurries back in, just as Slevin had opened the towel to remove it, giving her a square look at what it was covering.After Lindsey leaves, Slevin returns to the bathroom. Another knock sounds at the door. Thinking Lindsey is returning again, Slevin quickly opens the door... but in tromp two men named Elvis and Sloe, grunts in the employ of a man they only refer to as 'The Boss.' Sloe (Mykelti Williamson) is a burly man with big buck teeth, and a bit slow (his name being a clue). Elvis (Dorian Missick) is smaller but wiry, and a smooth fast-talker. Sloe and Elvis tell Slevin that they are there to pick up Nick and take him to The Boss. Slevin tries to protest that he isn't Nick, but of course, they don't listen-- he is in the apartment just at the time they were sent there, so naturally they are assuming he is Nick, and no matter what he protests, they have to bring him to see The Boss, because it's his orders. Slevin, seemingly unafraid, gets smart with Elvis, who shows he is no pushover with a few stiff punches. They load Slevin into their car, still clad only in the bath towel, and bring him to the penthouse of The Boss (Morgan Freeman).The Boss lives in the penthouse of an exclusive building, and is well-guarded. He turns out to be the leader of an organized crime ring. Slevin still seems unafraid and the opening conversation turns into a verbal cat-and-mouse (I bet it was that mouth that gave you that nose, The Boss remarks). Finally cutting to the chase, The Boss reveals that Nick, as they all believe Slevin to be, owes him $96,000 in gambling debt. To get out of this debt, he has to do The Boss a favor... kill the son of a rival crime boss known as The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley). The Rabbi actually is also an ordained rabbi, and his son, Yitzchok (Michael Rubenfeld), is known as 'The Fairy' because he is gay. This is in retaliation for the killing of The Boss' son; the Boss blames The Rabbi.As Slevin is escorted out by Sloe and Elvis to be returned to his apartment, The Boss begins speaking to a man, who apparently masterminded the whole affair-- it's 'Smith.' The Boss is puzzled because he hired Smith to kill someone, and Smith had Slevin (still assumed to be Nick Fisher) brought in to do it. Smith, shown to be a seasoned professional assassin, says he will indeed kill somebody.As Slevin is escorted out of the building into the car, two men hiding inside a vehicle disguised as a plumbing truck take a snapshot and one tells the other that they need to call someone named Brikowski. A new face is in town.Slevin goes back into Nick's apartment. Lindsey shows up, planning to take him to the Hotel Cheval. Nick still hasn't shown, and Lindsey has a friend who works at the hotel and can find out for them who placed the call to the apartment, from there. She notes Slevin looking intently at the newspaper he'd picked up-- on the front page is a headline about Slim Hopkins being missing, which the newspaper notes is ironic because Hopkins is thought to be behind several mysterious disappearances of other people. Slevin tells Lindsey he 'met' Slim, and that he was dead. Lindsey says maybe it's time Slevin tells her why he's still wearing only the bath towel.Lindsey hears her phone in her apartment ringing, and she rushes to answer it, as it may be her friend from the hotel. Slevin starts to get dressed while waiting for her. A knock sounds at the door, and he goes to answer, finding two Hasidic-looking men there, saying that Schlomo wants to see him. Trying to explain that he knows nobody named Schlomo, Slevin only ends up with another punch in his guts. These two thugs are Saul (Corey Stall), who does all the talking, and a Mute man (Rami Posner) who Saul hints can speak, but simply does not; especially to people he doesn't know.As he is driven to see this Schlomo-- The Rabbi-- he notes he's being driven back to the Boss' building, but Saul explains that the Rabbi lives in a building right across the street. Once, The Boss and The Rabbi were partners and even close friends, but one day they suddenly turned on one another and tried to kill each other, and ever since, neither has ever left the safety of their respective penthouses.The conversation between Slevin and The Rabbi proves to be another game of verbal cat-and-mouse, Slevin unafraid and talking back to The Rabbi. The Rabbi finally tells Slevin that he (they also believe Slevin is Nick Fisher, despite his protests) owes him (the Rabbi) $33,000. The Rabbi gives him 48 hours to raise it by any means necessary. Saul will watch over Slevin. Slevin, seemingly just trying to further provoke the Rabbi, comments on not being frisked before being placed in front of the Rabbi. The Rabbi reveals he had a shotgun at the ready under the table.After Slevin is escorted out, The Rabbi begins telling someone unseen that he's made half of a pre-arranged payment to the person's account in the Cayman Islands, and the other half will be paid when 'their old friend' is in the ground. Coming into view is... Smith. The Rabbi asks Smith what is up with Slevin (still thought to be Fisher); Smith simply says that 'the kid' and he have 'some unfinished business.'But as Smith begins to leave, The Rabbi suddenly stops him by saying that he has developed a talent for knowing when someone is lying; it is what has kept him alive for many years. He knows that Slevin was not lying when he said he wasn't Nick Fisher. Smith simply (and cryptically) says that he knows that Slevin is not Fisher, as he continues on his way out.Back in Fisher's apartment, Lindsey is telling Slevin that she's learned that the call to Nick at the apartment came from room 1009 at the Hotel, and that's it's registered to man named Smith (Lindsey sees through the name without any trouble). She took the elevator to the tenth floor and Smith walked out of his room, so Lindsey pretended to be walking to the elevator instead of coming out of it, and rode down with him. Pretending to be talking to someone on her cell phone, she leaned across the car to press a button, and carefully used her phone to take a digital photo of Smith, and he didn't notice. She shows Slevin the photo, and Slevin says he doesn't know the man. Lindsey says that Smith hailed a cab, and she followed him from a short distance; he went into a luxury building downtown and Lindsey waited outside for an hour, before who should exit the building but... Slevin, flanked by two Hasidic Jews.Slevin tells Lindsey the whole story with The Boss and The Rabbi, and the double pickle he is in with the two of them; to say nothing of being shadowed by this mysterious Smith who Slevin doesn't know... and to top it off, he isn't Nick Fisher, and the real Nick Fisher is nowhere to be found. Lindsey is curious at how calm and unruffled Slevin is throughout all of what's transpired. Slevin explains that he has ataraxia; a psychological condition that causes him to never feel worry or overwhelming nervousness. Slevin tells Lindsey he has to give The Boss his answer on whether to do the job The Boss wants him to do.Cut to the Boss' penthouse where Slevin tells The Boss he will do the job. Slevin says he will need a week, but The Boss says he has three days. When Slevin tries to warn The Boss about a move in a chess game he's playing with Elvis, The Boss notes that Slevin knows how to play, and tells him that if he wins a game against The Boss, he'll have his week.As they play, The Boss asks Slevin about his plan for carrying out the hit on Yitzchok (the camera shows The Boss' hand as he moves a piece, and his pinky ring). Slevin appears unconcerned, and The Boss warns him that Yitzchok has 'shadows.' A flashback of The Boss playing a game of chess with Smith, shows Smith explaining that Yitzchok is bodyguarded constantly by Israeli men who served in the elite Mossad division of the Israeli military. The Boss tells Slevin about them: they live in an apartment next door to Yitzchok, who wears a Star of David around his neck with a secret transmission device hidden in it-- a panic button that will summon these shadowing bodyguards in an instant like an emergency alarm. Through another flashback of The Boss' chess game with Smith, it's explained that the response time is three to five seconds, meaning Slevin has to do the hit when Yitzchok would least expect it, in his apartment. The Boss tells Slevin that since he's not likely to get in the front door, to use the back door-- back in the flashbacks of The Boss and Smith, is a part Slevin does not become privy to. Smith plans that after Slevin kills Yitzchok, Smith will kill Slevin, place the gun in Yitzchok's hand to get his prints on it, fire a shot so Yitzchok will have powder burns, and the scene will appear like two gay lovers committing double suicide because of anti-gay persecution. The Boss is delighted at Smith's seemingly well-thought-out plan for killing Yitzchok.The Boss defeats Slevin in their chess game and tells him he has three days. The Boss excuses himself and Smith walks into the Penthouse, and for the first time, Slevin looks deeply concerned.As Sloe and Elvis bring Slevin back to their car to drive him back 'home,' they are watched by the same mysterious men who'd photographed them before. They're wondering just who on Earth Slevin is, noting that he has unknown connections with both The Boss and The Rabbi. One man tells another to call Murphy and see if he has a match for the photo that Marty snapped.A third enters the plumbing truck that serves as their surveillance vehicle, telling the first two that the Kat is in town; a seriously deadly assassin named Goodkat, who hasn't done any work in New York for twenty years. The first man says he has to get down to the morgue.As Slevin walks back into 'his apartment,' Lindsey comes rushing in, saying she's figured everything out. She remembers Slevin telling her that Slim Hopkins worked for The Boss. Right now in the morgue is another bookie named Benny Begin, who worked for the Rabbi... Lindsey works as a coroner. A flashback shows her examining the body of Benny Begin. Entering the morgue is the bald man from the surveillance vehicle-- Detective Brikowski (Stanley Tucci). Lindsey and Brikowski talk, and Brikowski reveals he knows Begin; he confides in her that twenty years ago, Begin was his bookie; Brikowski used to send his paychecks to Begin. The other two men in the morgue (Begin's thugs) were killed by an exotic poison injected into them.Lindsey explains to Slevin that she believes Nick set Slevin up to take the fall for him. Nick must have hired the mugger-- he left Slevin's suitcase and watch because he only wanted Slevin's wallet, which contains his only ID. Begin and Hopkins were the only two people connected to The Boss and the Rabbi who knew what Nick looked like; he must have gotten them killed. Then he took off, left his apartment unlocked so Slevin could let himself in, and left him there holding the bag-- his identity, and his debts to The Boss and The Rabbi. She is insanely puzzled at Slevin only musing that Nick has been painting him into corners since they were kids; he's always been a better friend to Nick than Nick was to him. Lindsey announces she has to return to work (she's been talking to Slevin while on lunch break) and starts to rush out... but then suddenly comes back inside and asks Slevin if he will go out to dinner with her.That evening, Slevin and Lindsey are having dinner at a nice restaurant. Slevin reveals that he's learned Yitzchok frequents the place. Lindsey is shocked, knowing that Slevin can't simply approach him-- but Slevin knows that when Yitzchok goes to use the bathroom, his bodyguards will not follow. That will allow Slevin the opportunity to go in with him, strike up a conversation, and maybe get a 'date' with him.Brikowski is at the restaurant too, observing. talking with Marty through hidden microphones and earpieces, Brikowski tells Marty that he sees Yitzchok and his bodyguards in the middle of the restaurant, and Slevin not too far away, dining with a woman he can't make out; he doesn't recognize Lindsey because her back is to him. Brikowski asks if Murphy came up with anything on the photo of Slevin, and Marty says that Murphy hasn't been able to find anyone who remembers just bumping into Slevin on the street-- he's like a ghost that simply appeared in town.Yitzchok goes to use the men's room, and Slevin follows. Brikowski starts to follow, alerting Yitzchok's bodyguards who start to follow Brikowski. Brikowski finds that Slevin discretely locked the door behind him, though Marty assures Brikowski that Slevin wouldn't do anything inside the bathroom. The bodyguards appear behind Brikowski, who flashes his badge and says he's next in line for the bathroom.Slevin and Lindsey are walking home from dinner and Slevin tells Lindsey that he simply up and asked Yitzchok for a date while they were in the men's room together, and Yitzchok accepted. Slevin suddenly gets Lindsey to duck into the doorway of a store they're passing; he is sure he is being tailed by police. Through a flashback, we see Slevin's explanation to Lindsey of Brikowski confronting Slevin in the men's room after Yitzchok walked out. Brikowski reveals he knows that Slevin is staying in Nick Fisher's apartment, but he knows that Slevin is not Nick Fisher-- Fisher spent eight years in prison for sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl, and the prison sent Brikowski a photo of Fisher, who doesn't look like Slevin. Brikowski wants to know who Slevin is. Slevin says he's just man whose dinner is getting cold.Lindsey is amused at the craziness of everything going on around Slevin, saying she reminds him of James Bond. She wonders which Bond villain The Boss would be, running off a short list of actors who played villains in Bond movies. Slevin says The Boss would be Anthony Dawson, who played Blofeld in 'From Russia with Love;' this despite the fact that nobody ever saw Blofeld's face in the movie.Slevin and Lindsey arrive back at their apartments right across from one another. Slevin is about to enter his apartment, but suddenly walks into Lindsey's apartment and they sleep together.In the morning, Slevin goes to get some coffee to bring back for himself and Lindsey, passing by both Saul and Mute, and Elvis and Sloe, in their respective cars. As he passes a pay phone, the man talking on the phone grabs Slevin, identifying himself as police, and pushes Slevin into the plumbing truck they use for surveillance.Brikowski tries to grill Slevin to talk about himself, who he is, what's going on with him. Yet again Slevin gets smart-mouthed, even after he ends up getting punched in his stomach yet again. He does give Brikowski his full name, Slevin Kelevra, spelling out Kelevra for him. Brikowski is unable to get anything more out of him, and they toss him out of the truck.Slevin arrives back at Lindsey's with coffee for both of him. He appears very deeply troubled about something, hesitant to disturb Lindsey, who has drifted back to sleep. Finally he simply lays down beside her and they make out again before Lindsey has to dress and go to work.Elvis and Sloe show up, bringing a suit Slevin needs to wear; the Boss wants him to 'look nice' for his date with Yitzchok. As they put him in their car and drive off, we see that behind their car was the vehicle driven by Saul and Mute-- and they are both dead, two bullet holes in the windshield; each of the thugs dead from one of the bullets.Slevin arrives early at Yitzchok's apartment for their date. Yitzchok brings him in, inviting Slevin to fix himself a drink. He starts to make small talk with Slevin, who merely listens. Suddenly Slevin tells Yitzchok that someone is trying to kill him. When Yitzchok asks who, Slevin simply answers, 'me,' and guns Yitzchok down with a lightning draw of a silenced handgun.As Slevin crouches beside the dying Yitzchok, Smith stealthily enters the apartment. Coming up behind Slevin, he raises his gun and cocks the hammer. Just as Slevin turns, Smith fires a shot-- into Yitzchok, who had managed to draw his own gun when Slevin had turned away and was going to fire a return shot. Smith remarks, 'that was close,' as he hands Slevin a set of keys. Slevin hurries out of the apartment as Smith goes to the apartment wall and listens intently to voices speaking indistinctly on the other side.Slevin hurries down to the building garage and opens an SUV, pulling out a large valise; one of the flaps ajar to show a timer of some sort. Smith turns Yitzchok over and notices the slight glow of a blue LED on his Star of David. Yitzchok had managed to hit his 'panic button' just before he died, meaning his bodyguards will be on the scene in just a few seconds.Smith stands up, holding his gun and Slevin's, both silenced. The door to the apartment is shown as Smith readies himself. The door opens, and Slevin comes through, pulling the valise. Smith is in fact, facing the apartment wall. The two Mossad bodyguards bust through the wall, built special to accommodate such a purpose, and run right into a hail of gunfire from Smith's two guns. Smith spits in disdain as he looks at the dead bodyguards.Slevin pulls in the oversized valise; inside is the body of the scruffy man Smith killed at the bus terminal. Slevin switches wristwatches with him before he and Smith leave the apartment. As they walk down the street together, an explosion tears out of the building-- they left a bomb inside Yitzchok's apartment.We see an elevator ascending from a view above the car. Sparks and the crackle of electricity play across the roof of the car. We see the body of a dead man lying atop the car. The car arrives at its destination, and we see the feet and legs of a man exiting the car as Elvis and Sloe lay dead inside.The man is Smith. He arrives at The Boss' penthouse and stands before The Boss and his chief bodyguard. The Boss is not pleased. He berates Smith, saying he hired Smith to carry out a hit in such a way that it did not look like a professional hit. But with the Mossad guards gunned down and Yitzchok's apartment bombed, the hit cannot help but look anything other than professional. Finally the Boss sighs and says that if the Rabbi wants war, the Boss will give him a war. Smith merely stands before The Boss, looking silently at him with a smug expression.Slevin is arriving at The Rabbi's penthouse across the street carrying a briefcase. Inside, Slevin says, is the money owed The Rabbi. The Rabbi is trying to reach Saul on the phone, even though it's the Sabbath and they don't answer the phone. As the Rabbi bends over the briefcase, Slevin stealthily takes out a blackjack and holds it behind him. The Rabbi opens the briefcase, revealing it is empty, and Slevin clubs him over the head with the blackjack, knocking The Rabbi cold. As he strikes, Slevin says, 'Saul's dead-- they're all dead,' and a flashback to Saul and Mute sitting dead in their car shows a brief reflection of Smith in the windshield. He, not Elvis and Sloe, killed them.The Rabbi wakes up, tied to a chair in what he realizes is The Boss' penthouse. He starts to talk out loud, remembering how he's spent twenty years behind windows of bulletproof glass, realizing he's been a prisoner in his own home, and now noting he's been delivered into The Boss' hands by a boy. He congratulates The Boss for winning the long-standing feud between them-- and he calls the Boss, 'Anthony.' Anthony Dawson, the name dropped by Slevin as he and Lindsey chatted about James Bond after their date, is The Boss' real name.But The Boss tells The Rabbi he can save his congratulations-- he is tied to a chair back to back with The Rabbi. He tells The Rabbi they were both sold a bill of goods by the same salesman.Quickly the Boss and The Rabbi fall into an argument. The Rabbi accuses The Boss of getting them both into the situation they're both in, because he hired Goodkat to kill The Rabbi's son. The Boss snaps back that The Rabbi killed his son, though The Rabbi denies this. The Boss sarcastically remarks that The Rabbi must not have had any hand in what happened back in 1984-- the year their partnership ended. It's revealed that The Boss was building enough influence that the balance of power between he and the Rabbi was becoming badly skewed in The Boss' favor, and the Rabbi feared that he would cease being a partner to The Boss and end up a subordinate, or even, one day, excess baggage... so he arranged to have The Boss killed. The Boss' wife died in the hit, but The Boss survived and managed to also save his son. But now his son was killed and The Boss holds The Rabbi responsible. But he says he's evened the score. The Rabbi again tries to deny arranging the hit on The Boss' son, but freezes mid-sentence. The Boss flashes an evil grin as he reveals what The Rabbi hasn't learned yet-- Yitzchok is dead. The Boss had him killed. The Rabbi starts to vow that he will get even with The Boss.Slevin comes down the stairs into the room, and The Boss tries to speak to him. Slevin tells him that he's already said he is not Nick Fisher. When The Boss asks who Nick Fisher is, Slevin says that Fisher WAS the answer to a question: how to get to two people who couldn't be gotten to. He needed to get them to come to him. To do that, he needed an identity. Through a series of flashbacks with Slevin's voiceover, it's revealed that Smith killed The Boss' bookkeeper, Slim Hopkins, and Slevin killed The Rabbi's bookkeeper, Benny Begin. They took their gambling ledgers and compared them, looking for someone who owed both of them a lot of money; a down-on-his-luck lowlife that nobody would miss-- that person was Nick Fisher. It's shown that Fisher was the scruffy man killed by Smith at the bus terminal; another flashback shows Slevin switching wristwatches with Fisher after dumping his corpse in Yitzchok's apartment. It's safely ascertained that Fisher was leaving town to try and escape his debts when Smith killed him at the terminal.Slevin then reveals that he, not The Rabbi, was the one who killed The Boss' son. He executed a very professional looking hit so The Boss would suspect The Rabbi. Wanting revenge but not wanting to incite a full war, The Boss asked for an outside 'specialist' named Mr. Goodkat to handle it. The phone ringing at the hotel room is shown again, and we see that 'Smith' and Mr. Goodkat, the specialist, are in fact one and the same. The Boss asks Goodkat to kill Yitzchok in such a way that it does not look like a professional hit. Setting the hook, Goodkat asks to see a copy of Slim Hopkins' ledger and points out the name Nick Fisher, a 'loser' deep in debt who can be forced to act as triggerman. This would make the killing look sloppy and amateur, so the Rabbi would not know The Boss was responsible, and so he wouldn't go to war. The hotel room flashback also shows that Slevin's broken nose came from a punch thrown by Goodkat himself to make the 'mugging' story believable. The Boss wrote down Fisher's address and had Elvis and Sloe go to pick him up.After this, Goodkat secretly visited The Rabbi and told him that The Boss hired Goodkat to kill Yitzchok. But, Goodkat says, his 'friendship' is for sale, and he would never kill the son of a 'good friend.' If The Rabbi doubled the fee that the Boss paid Goodkat, then Goodkat would kill The Boss instead. Then as a 'favor' from one 'friend' to another, Goodkat requests that The Rabbi collect on a debt owed to him... a flop in Benny's book named Nick Fisher. Once all this was done, Slevin, posing as Fisher despite bumbling protests about not being him, had his 'in' with both The Boss and The Rabbi, and could come and go between them as he wished.The Rabbi gets Slevin's attention. Mouthing his words so The Boss won't hear, The Rabbi offers to top whatever Slevin is being paid by whoever he is working for. At this point Slevin's demeanor quickly changes to one of complete, ice-cold, calculating malice. He tells The Boss and The Rabbi that he is not working for anyone; he himself is the mastermind of all that has transpired, up to and including having both The Boss and The Rabbi as his prisoners. Naturally at this point the question is, just who Slevin really is.The camera switches to Brikowski at the morgue, where Lindsey is examining the remains of a charred body. Brikowski hopes to identify the body through dental records, but Lindsey points out that the jaw was blown away and they wouldn't be able to find the dentist who has the records. Brikowski is then called away by Marty, telling him of two more bodies. Brikowski notes that Lindsey seems deeply troubled. She lies about being okay, but she is looking at the watch on the corpse's wrist-- it's Slevin's (the one he planted on Fisher's corpse). After Brikowski leaves, Goodkat shows up in the morgue, telling Lindsey that he has the same model of cell phone she does. He then takes her out with a precise gunshot to her heart.Brikowski is seen in his car, when he gets a call from Murphy. Murphy starts telling him about a now-retired co-worker who has been visiting the precinct. During his last visit, he suddenly started staring in amazement at the photo Marty took of Slevin... more specifically, at the name, 'Slevin Kelevra' that Brikowski and Murphy had written on a small sticky note on the bottom of the photo. Murphy starts to explain why this retired co-worker was so surprised at the name.The scene switches back and forth at this point between Slevin speaking to The Boss and The Rabbi, and Brikowski in his car, listening to Murphy over the phone. Voiceovers from Slevin and Murphy re-visit the 'local legend' in the racing circuit about a man named Max-- the same Max who was shown being killed in the beginning of the movie. It's revealed that Roth, the bookie who Max went to, laid Max's bet off on both The Boss and The Rabbi, who'd both just set up shop in New York recently (flashback scenes from Max's murder show The Boss and The Rabbi were both there via close-ups of what are shown to be The Boss's ring and The Rabbi's shotgun). The Boss and The Rabbi had found out that the racehorse Max bet on was doped up with performance-enhancing drugs, ensuring that whoever placed bets on the horse with either The Boss's or the Rabbi's bookies would win very big. Furious at the 'fix' and looking to set an example, they had Max, Roth, Max's wife, Max's son (Henry) and even the horse, all killed. Murphy then mentions that a specialist had to be brought in to kill young Henry because nobody else wanted to handle the job of executing so young a boy. The flashback of the gun being put to Henry's head is shown, and then we see Henry turning around to look at the specialist: it's Goodkat. Even Goodkat cannot bring himself to kill young Henry. He takes off his dark shades and looks at the boy for a long moment and slowly lowers his gun.Back in The Boss's office, both The Boss and The Rabbi stare at Slevin, completely dumbfounded. Slevin is Henry, Max's son. Instead of killing him, Goodkat took Henry under his wing and raised him to manhood... and the two spent the last twenty years carefully planning and preparing for this moment... Henry's exacting vengeance for the murders of his parents. With almost casual malice, Slevin brings out plastic bags and duct tape, asking them if they remember that part. He places the bags over the Boss and the Rabbi's heads, tapes the bags tightly in place around their necks, and leaves them to suffocate as they left his father to suffocate. Both crime rings are wiped out, up to and including their very kingpins.Back in Brikowski's car, Murphy is explaining that the name of the racehorse that Max bet on, was Lucky Number SLEVIN.Murphy muses about how Slevin came up with the name of a dead horse from 20 years ago, and had connections to two mob leaders that were also connected to that same horse. Neither he nor Brikowski have any leads or ideas, as Slevin has vanished. But as Murphy then starts to recite an afterthought about a new officer in the precinct office, Slevin is shown sitting up from hiding in the back seat of Brikowski's car, having been waiting there some time. Murphy says that the new officer is Jewish, and that he recognizes the surname Kelevra as Hebrew, and that it means...Before Murphy can finish the sentence, Slevin puts the silenced barrel of a gun to Brikowski's head and says, 'Bad Dog.' (A reference to Goodkat -- Good cat, bad dog). Another flashback of Max's wife (Slevin's mother) being killed, and a voiceover of Brikowski's confiding in Lindsey that Begin had been his bookie 20 years ago, and how he often was big in gambling debt, shows that Brikowski was forced by The Boss and The Rabbi to act as triggerman for the hit on Slevin's mother. The flashback to her murder now pans back from the triggerman to show Brikowski holding the shotgun.Slevin rubs Brikowski out with a single gunshot and walks off into the darkness.Cut to Slevin sitting in the same bus terminal where Fisher had been killed, waiting for a bus to leave New York City. Suddenly Lindsey, very much alive and well, is shown going up to him, where they embrace and kiss. Slevin had been waiting for Lindsey to go with him.More flashbacks show Goodkat confronting Slevin as he was returning to Lindsey's apartment with coffee, the morning after they'd slept together. Goodkat knew about Lindsey's taking his picture on her phone, acted like he didn't notice, and now was telling Slevin that she had to be killed. Slevin pretended to go along with Goodkat, but then explained everything to Lindsey, and prepared her to fake her own death. Lindsey is shown to have worn armor under her lab coat, with a pouch of blood from the blood bank strategically placed so her 'death' would look genuine.Back at the terminal, Lindsey and Slevin are still locked in their embrace when they realize Goodkat is watching them. Slevin goes up to Goodkat, saying he didn't think Goodkat would understand Slevin's secretly arranging to save Lindsey's life. Remembering how he once spared Slevin as a boy, Goodkat says he understood. But he chastises Slevin for not realizing that a professional assassin as seasoned as he, would find out. Goodkat gives Slevin Max's watch. Their job finally done, Goodkat parts ways with Slevin and walks off, letting Slevin and Lindsey go to begin a new life together.The movie closes with a flashback of young Henry in Goodkat's car, looking at Max's watch. He tells Goodkat he wants to go home, and Goodkat says neither of them is going home for a long time. He turns on the radio, and the song that starts to play is called 'The Kansas City Shuffle...' the catch-phrase Goodkat used regarding his various finesses.

title: The Matrix Reloaded
synopsis: Green code-rain starts pouring down the screen, first forming the words The Matrix, then Reloaded. The image zooms further in, there's coding everywhere, making out a jungle of shapes. We seem to be inside some kind of machinery, and after pulling out we see the shape of a clock. The image transforms into a time clock and a group of security guards clock out and leave for the night.Outside a figure in black on a matching motorcycle comes flying through the air. She leaps from the bike, makes a backward flip in mid-air and the bike lands with a crash on the guardhouse causing a major explosion. The figure lands elegantly in front of the explosion. As she removes her helmet we see it is Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). The guards in the parking lot attack her, but she easily fights them off. The picture crumbles into coding like dust, and when restored we're very high up on the side of a building. Trinity bursts through the window, guns in hand. She turns on her back in mid-air, an agent is pursuing her and jumps after, head first. They exchange gunfire, falling to the streets below in slow motion. Eventually Trinity is shot in the chest. Something (impossible to see who or what) crashes into a car by the sidewalk. Neo (Keanu Reeves) wakes up. He looks over at Trinity lying in his arms, sleeping peacefully, then gets out of bed.We see the Nebuchadnezzar from outside as it hovers through the sewers and lands. Inside are Link (Harold Perrineau) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) in the cockpit. Sir, Are you sure about this? Link asks. Morpheus tells him that if he is to continue as operator on his ship Link must trust him. Yes, sir. I will sir, says Link. Morpheus glances at him. I mean I do, sir.In the mess hall sits Neo, pondering. Trinity sits down opposite him. Still can't sleep? she asks. Neo shakes his head and takes a sip from his breakfast. You wanna talk? Trinity offers. They're just dreams, Neo reassures. If you're afraid of something... I just wish... I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do, that's all. I just wish I knew. She's gonna call, don't worry, assures Trinity. Link pops his head in and Trinity asks Are we ready to go? We're already late, he replies.In a dark room underground Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) is addressing a crowd of other ship crews about the imminent threat to Zion. The machines are digging and will reach Zion in 72 hours. Naturally Morpheus and crew arrive fashionably late, making sure to draw attention by making an argument right away that there is nothing to fear, for he believes the prophecy will come true very soon and end the war. But first the Oracle must be consulted. Accordingly, Morpheus asks for a volunteer ship to remain in broadcast depth while the Nebuchadnezzar returns to Zion to recharge and make repairs, despite Commander Lock's direct orders for ALL ships to return. Captain Ballard (Roy Jones Jr.) of the Caduceus volunteers just to see what Lock does to you. He gives Morpheus 36 hours.Meanwhile someone knocks on the entrance door. The corrupt (Paul Cotter) opens a small hatch on the door and a head in silhouette is seen against the headlights of a car. The stranger asks for Neo. The guard claims not to know who he's talking about and the stranger hands him an envelope telling him to give it to Neo. You see he set me free. It's beyond doubt the voice of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).Neo, having sensed something, comes up asking what's going on. How did you know someone was here? one of the guards asks. He wanted me to give you this, and hands Neo the envelope. Into Neo's palm drops an earpiece worn by agents. Agents are coming, warns Neo. They flee, leaving Neo to handle the threat.The three agents recognize Neo as the anomaly, but proceed anyway on the basis that he is after all only human. Neo pauses momentarily while blocking a blow, Hm. Upgrades. He fights them off with ease. When the battle is over Neo crouches down, the ground ripples and he shoots to the skies (as he did in the very end of the prequel). At the scene of the battle, Smith walks up and states that it all went as expected. Facing him is another Smith, Yes. It's all happening exactly as before... Well, not exactly... They smile.Morpheus and Trinity are driving to an exit as Morpheus calls Link and asks what happened. Link says a bunch of agents showed up and that suddenly the coding got all weird. He has never seen anything like it. Morpheus then asks where Neo is now. He's doing his Superman-thing.Like Link said, Neo is soaring through the clouds. Then he stops and heads back down to the ground. He lands in an old building and enters an abandoned apartment, which we recognize as that of the Oracle. Where are you? he whispers.The Nebuchadnezzar approaches Zion. Link communicates with one of the gate operators and they are let inside. Once landed The crew exits the ship and are met by Captain Mifune (Nathaniel Lees) and three A.P.U. escorts. Are you here to escort me to the stockades, captain? asks Morpheus. I'm just here to keep the peace, assures Mifune. Commander Lock wants to see Morpheus and accordingly the escorts take him to him. What's with them? Neo asks. Lock and Morpheus? asks Trinity back. Neo nods. Niobe. Captain Niobe? Mhm. She used to be with Morpheus, now she's with Lock. What happened? Morpheus went to the Oracle, after that everything changed. Yeah, she can do that. Trinity, Neo and Link start gathering their luggage when a teenage boy (Clayton Watson) comes running enthusiastically towards them. How does he always know? Trinity asks Neo in a hushed voice. Doesn't he have anything better to do? wonders Neo. You know what they say about the life you save... answers Trinity. I didn't save his life, Neo claims. The kid, now right in front of them, welcomes them home and offers to carry their bags. Both Neo and Trinity decline. You can carry these... says Link. Sure, Link.As they all walk towards the elevators the kid starts going on about how he will be old enough to join a crew next year and that he wants to serve aboard the Nebuchadnezzar. His main reason for this is that Neo saved him. You saved yourself, assures Neo.Meanwhile Lock (Harry Lennix) tells Morpheus off for asking a ship to stay behind, when they all had been ordered back to Zion. Morpheus defends himself with his belief that they must have the Oracles advice and that Neo will be the key to ending the war. Lock on the other hand has no confidence in the prophecy and is only concerned with having all the firepower available for when the machines reaches Zion.The kid mentions a gathering that evening, a bigger one than anyone can remember. It is a popular belief that something big will happen.Councillor Hamann (Anthony Zerbe) enters in the middle of the discussion. He asks their opinion on what is to be said about the situation to the people at the gathering that evening. Lock believes they should know as little as possible, they wouldn't want to start a panic. Morpheus thinks the truth should be told and that there will be no panic because there is nothing to fear.They enter the elevator and after a few seconds of silence Link gets off telling the kid to come with him. These two have other things to do. As soon as the elevator doors closes Neo and Trinity drop their bags and make out passionately. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? asks Neo. I'm thinking this elevator is too damn slow, replies Trinity. But before long they are interrupted by the elevator doors opening and are received by a crowd of people. They carry offerings, asking Neo to look over their sick children etc. Neo thanks them for their gifts and says he'll try. Trinity lowers her head in disappointment and starts to walk away. Neo asks her not to go, but Trinity answers, It's okay. They need you. I need you, he pleads. I know, there's time, she assures him and walks away.Meanwhile, Link arrives at his apartment where his girlfriend, Zee (Nona Gaye), is waiting with her sister-in-law, Cas (Gina Torres), her niece (Alima Ashton-Sheibu) and nephew (Joshua Mbakwe). Uncle Link! the little ones exclaim as he walks through the door. After welcoming him home, Cas and her kids leave. Zee is not happy at all. Link serving on Morpheus' ship terrifies her. All other ships are home twice as often as the Nebucadnezzar. She has also already lost two brothers to that ship and is afraid she will lose him too. It's not fair, she says. You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not? Link argues. He also says nothing will happen to him, Morpheus says it will all be over soon. The important thing is that he's home now and they hug.Evening comes and everyone is gathered in Zion's temple cavern. Counselor Hamann is standing on a cliff high above the masses, as he gives the opening prayer and introduces Morpheus, who then steps up and gives his speech. He confirms the rumors of the machines digging, and convinces everyone that there is indeed nothing to be afraid of. We are still here! is his main argument and tonight they will make so much noise as to show the machines that they are not afraid. The music starts and everyone starts dancing as if it really was their last night on earth.As he leaves the podium, Morpheus runs into Niobe and they flirt mildly before Lock call her to his side.Meanwhile Neo and Trinity meet up in the outskirts of the caves. I was thinking. Everyone's here... says Neo. Follow me. answers Trinity. While everyone else parties like never before, Neo and Trinity are alone at last and they make passionate love to each other and have the sex of their lives!However, Neo suddenly gets a flash of his dream where Trinity is shot and falls into his fears of losing her. Trinity asks what is wrong, but he only answers that he is afraid of losing her. She grasps his hand, Do you feel this? I'm never letting go. They hold each other tightly and remain silently in each others arms.Eventually everyone goes to bed and the lights are shut down.Back in the Matrix Bane (Ian Bliss) and another member of the Caduceus crew are fleeing for their lives from something. They have reached an exit and have a message from the Oracle. Bane goes last and just before he can get out Smith jumps through the skylight and plunges his hand into Bane's chest. Oh, God shivers Bane in terror. Smith will suffice, says the former agent satisfied. Black fluid of sorts spreads all over Bane's body from where Smith has his hand, and once covered he is another Smith-clone. The clone then puts the phone to his ear and leaves the Matrix.Neo wakes up and goes outside his apartment gazing over the city. Councillor Hamann approaches him and offers his company. Neo accepts. Hamann asks if Neo has ever been to the engineering level. He has not, so they go. Once down there Hamann tells Neo about his wondering if they, the free humans, aren't in a sense plugged into these machines. They do after all depend on them. Neo answers that they control these machines, that if they wanted to they could shut them down, destroy them. But, Hamann points out there is the catch. If they did turn them off, what would happen to their water supply, heat etc.? But in the end he has no point to his musings and they leave it at that.It's morning and Ballard knocks on a door in Zion and Trinity opens. Is Neo here? Trinity opens the door further and Neo appears. It's a message from the Oracle. Against Lock's orders Morpheus takes off with ship and crew to have Neo meet with her.Before departure Zee tries to urge Link to wear her lucky necklace. He reluctantly agrees, not believing in that stuff, and they kiss.As the party go their ship Bane/Smith sits in nook of the tunnel, cutting his hand with a knife. When the quartet pass him, he sneaks up behind them, knife in hand. He is discovered though when the kid from before comes running. Neo! Bane/Smith hides the knife behind his back and claims he just wanted to say good luck. The kid has to say goodbye to his hero too before he leaves and give him something from one of the orphans. He said you'd understand. It's a metal spoon.Lock is outraged at Counselor Hamann for giving the Nebuchadnezzar clearance to leave. He did so because he believes their survival depends on more than how many ships they have.Neo enters the Matrix near the designated address, which is in Chinatown. He enters a small room from the street and at the back of the room sits an Asian-looking man in corresponding clothes, meditating. To Neo, who sees everything in coding, the stranger radiates a golden light. Welcome, he says. I am Seraph. He will take Neo to the Oracle. But first I must apologize. For what? wonders Neo. For this, says Seraph (Collin Chou) and attacks. After some kicking, punching and blocking, Seraph is satisfied. He had to make sure Neo really was the One, as the Oracle has many enemies. You could have just asked, claims Neo with a smile. You do not really know someone until you fight them, answers Seraph. He then shuts the door to the street, pulls out a key that he turns in the key hole and opens the door again. It no longer leads to the streets of Chinatown, but to a white hallway lined with green doors. These are back doors, Neo concludes. Seraph confirms. Where'd they go? Link wonders in the real world. They walk down the hall till Seraph stops and opens another door. This one leads to an isolated courtyard where the Oracle (Gloria Foster) sits waiting on a bench.Neo approaches her and she asks him to sit down. He politely declines. Suit yourself, she says and shrugs. Neo sits down after all. I felt like sitting. Of course.Let's get the obvious out of the way, the Oracle starts. You're not human, are you, Neo says.
Doesn't get more obvious than that. If I had to guess I'd say you were a program of the machine world. And so is he, Neo looks at Seraph. I guess the most obvious question is, how can I trust you? The Oracle answers that he has to choose whether to trust her or not.
Candy? she offers him.
You already know if I'm going to take it?
Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
Then how can I make a choice?
The Oracle replies that he has already made the choice and only needs to understand it. But why are you here? wonders Neo.
The Oracle points out a flock of crows and explains that at some point a program to govern them as well as all other things. The programs that do their job are invisible, as opposed those who do not. The latter manifest as what humans refer to as ghosts, vampires etc.
When a program faces deletion it can either choose to hide out here or return to the Source. Where you must go.
The machine mainframe.
You've seen, haven't you? The The door of bright light.
Neo confirms.
What happens when you walk through it?!
I see Trinity. Something bad happens and Trinity starts to fall.
Do you see her die?
No
You've got the sight now Neo.
Neo wants to know why he can not see what happen to Trinity, but the answer he gets is simply that we cannot see past the choices we do not understand.
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?
No, Neo. You've already made the choice.
Neo refuses to accept this, he can not do such a thing, but he has to.
Why?
Because you are the One.
If Neo doesn't go to the Source all of Zion will perish, and to get there he will need the Keymaker, an exile program currently held captive by the Merovingian an old and dangerous program.Seraph comes over saying they must leave and so he and the Oracle leave through the back door. Just as the door closes Smith appears. Apparently Neo and he are connected somehow. He explains that when Neo destroyed him he was supposed to be deleted, but he refused to obey the rules and has now become unplugged. Then there is the question of purpose and Smith-clones start coming towards them, each elaborating on the importance of purpose. When the original Smith and Neo are surrounded by clones, Smith tries to turn him into another clone, but with some effort Neo manages to resist and pulls Smith's hand out of his chest. All Smiths attack. A lengthy fight ensues, more clones joining in continually. In the middle of it all an agent comes to the scene only to be turned into yet another clone, but not before recognizing Smith in surprise. Eventually Neo abandons the fight and all the clones go their separate ways.Back in the real world Neo is unplugged.
It was Smith, says Morpheus.
Neo confirms and that he has found a way to copy himself.In Zion the council and all crews are gathered. Lock explains their current situation and tactics. The council have limited confidence in these tactics. They then ask if there has been word from the Nebucadnezzar. There has not. Hence the council asks for two volunteer ships to go search for them, against Lock's protests. Captain Soren (Steve Bastoni) stands up immediately. No other reacts to the request. Bane/Smith suggests to Ballard that they should volunteer, but Ballard just tells him to shut up. Eventually Niobe declares her willingness to search for the missing party, to Lock's surprise and horror. He tries to forbid her to go, but she is determined, because some things never change and some things do.Neo, Trinity and Morpheus arrive at a French restaurant in the Matrix, where thy find the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci), at the head table as if they were king and queen. As a trafficker of information, as he calls himself, the Merovingian knows why they are there. The question is, according to him, do they know? He says they are there because they were told to, declares he has no intention of letting go of the Keymaker and tells them to tell the Oracle from him that her time is almost up. He also explains to them what he holds as the one truth, namely the forces of causality. As he has said all he feels like sharing he cuts the negotiations short and excuses himself to the men's room. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are escorted to the elevator by the Merovingian's henchmen.When the elevator stops and the doors open they see Persephone waiting for them.
If you want the Keymaker, follow me, she says dryly and takes them to the men's room (where the Merovingian is not).
Why are you doing this? Neo asks. Her answer is that she has come to resent her husband. She will take them to the Keymaker on one condition: that Neo kiss her as if she were Trinity, she wants to remember what love feels like. Trinity protests by pulling a gun at Persephone, but as they need the Keymaker she has no choice but to back down and look on in anguish. As soon as Persephone is satisfied she fulfills her promise.She leads them through the kitchen of the restaurant and to a door at the other end. This she opens with a key similar to that of Seraph's. This takes them to the great hall of a chateau. Persephone further leads the party to a small study where two shady men are sitting guard. She shoots one with a silver bullet and tells the other to tell his master what she has done or die like his friend. He's in the lady's room, Persephone shouts after the vampire as he scurries off and opens a secret door to the dungeons, where they find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim).As they re-enter the main hall, the Merovingian and his henchmen burst through the front door. He is shocked by his wife's actions and fail to understand her reasons. She plainly explains that it is just like he said: cause and effect. The Merovingian claims there is no cause for this, but Persephone points out the lipstick he is still wearing (not on his lips...) and leaves.The Merovingian immediately order the Twins (Neil Rayment and Adrian Rayment), who turn out to have the ability to turn into spectrals, to get the Keymaker back. The Keymaker flees right away and Trinity and Morpheus follow him, leaving Neo to handle the henchmen. They put up more of a fight than the agents, but are still not much of a match for the One. Disappointed the Merovingian and company leave the way they came, closing the door behind them. This causes the connection between the restaurant and castle to break and when he re-opens the door Neo finds himself high up in the mountains. He therefore runs the way the Keymaker went.Meanwhile, the Keymaker connects the door at the end of a hallway to a parking lot, but Trinity fails to close the door before one of the Twins gets an arm between the door and the door frame. Thus the other twin can merely glide through in spectral form, prompting Trinity to fight him (Morpheus holds the door), but she loses and the Twin pulls a knife to her throat. Morpheus has no choice but to let the other Twin through. In the meantime, the Keymaker acquires a car and Trinity runs over and gets in the driver's seat while Morpheus holds the Twins at bay. Morpheus gets in the car and they flee. As they drive away one of the twins closes the door in Neo's face.Neo crashes through the door anyway, but is again in the mountains. He calls Link who can only tell him he's in the mountains. Neo then inquires how Trinity and Morpheus are doing. They are in trouble, Link tells him, and gives him directions to their whereabouts.In the city Morpheus and Trinity are zooming through the streets trying to shake off the pursuing Twins who have acquired a car of their own. Morpheus calls Link for help and it turns out the only way is onto the freeway. By now, a load of police cars are on their tail. You always told me to stay off the freeway, says Trinity.
Yes, that's true.
You said it was suicide.
Then let us hope that I was wrong.Elsewhere in the Matrix, Niobe calls Link to tell him they have come to get them out. Just follow the sirens... says Link.On the freeway, the Twins are now in front of Morpheus and co. and as soon as they run out of ammo, the one not driving takes spectral form and lands himself in the backseat of the other car, next to the Keymaker. Morpheus tries to fight him off, to little avail. Then Agents show up; one lands on the hood of Trinity's and Morpheus's car and rips off the roof. Morpheus, though held down by the Twin, fires at him, but this helps no more than it ever has before. Trinity hits the brakes so that the Agent is flung off. Morpheus continues to struggle with the Twin and eventually gets hold of a sword which he thrusts through his seat, forcing the twin to let go of his solid self and get left behind. He is immediately picked up by his brother.
We are getting aggravated.
Yes, we are.
Another Agent has caught up with our heroes and fires away as well hitting them with his car. They manage to lose him though, by leaving the freeway in a way that causes the Agent to crash into the railing. They are now on a bridge over the freeway and come to a full stop.
Trinity, get him out of here, orders Morpheus.
Come on! she shouts to the Keymaker and they jump off the bridge onto a truck below carrying a load of motorcycles. Morpheus stays behind to handle the Twins. He does this by causing their crash and shooting the gas tank.Trinity and the Keymaker obtain a motorcycle and continue towards their exit. It is not long however before an Agent takes control of a semi-truck, forcing Trinity to turn around. Police follow and are soon transformed into more Agents. Morpheus comes towards them on the roof of another semi-truck and grabs the Keymaker. Trinity is no longer being pursued and escapes, as it is the Keymaker the Agents want this time. An Agent therefore attacks Morpheus instead, and they battle on top of the semi. After a while Morpheus, is thrown off, but Niobe catches him on the hood of her car. The Agent approaches the Keymaker.
You are no longer necessary.
We do only what we're meant to do, says the Keymaker.
Then you're meant for only one more thing. Deletion. replies the Agent .
Just as the Agent is about to terminate the Exile, Mopheus jumps on him, throwing him off. This only prompts the Agent to relocate to the driver's seat of the same semi-truck, and forces Niobe to leave. Further back another Agent is in control of another semi-truck and turns the truck, aiming for the other truck and a head-on collision.
Neo, if you're out there, I could use some help, prays Mopheus to himself.
What is that? wonders Link about something on the screen.
Neo comes flying through the air, grabbing Morpheus and the Keymaker in the nick of time.In Zion, they learn that the machines drilling through the earth are currently being slowed down by iron, which means they will be in Zion in little over nine hours.Soren, Niobe, Morpheus and their crews are gathered with the Keymaker. He tells them what they must do. Neo must go through the door that leads to the source, but to keep the entire building from exploding, the electrical network providing energy to 27 square blocks must be disabled. Niobe and Ghost (Anthony Brandon Wong) must therefore take out a power station while Soren and his crew deactivate the emergency network. This will give a five-minute window during which Neo must open the door. All must be done as one. If one fails, all fail, the Keymaker instructs.Back in the real world, while waiting for it to be time for him to go, Neo makes Trinity promise not to enter the Matrix. She agrees.Niobe and Ghost succeed, but Soren and his crew are killed by Sentinels just before they accomplish their mission. Link and Trinity discover that they aren't moving and so Trinity has to go in to finish their job.As Neo sees the lights go out he, Morpheus and the Keymaker enter the hall of back door, where they are met by Smith.Trinity enters the Matrix and all happens as in Neo's dreams.In the hallway Neo and Morpheus are assaulted by a horde of Smiths. They try to take Morpheus' body for their own, but Neo prevents it. In the heat of the battle the Keymaker sneaks around by using alternate doors and opens the one they seek just as the power grid fails again, thanks to Trinity. Neo grabs Morpheus and flies through the door. Unfortunately the Keymaker is gunned down by Smiths as he closes it again, and dies. Before taking his last breath, he tells Morpheus which door to take to get home and gives Neo the key he needs to open the special door. Simultaneously an Agent is heading for Trinity without her knowledge. Neo enters the door of light.He is now in a room where the walls are made up of old-fashioned television screens. In a chair on the other side of the room sits the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis), the one who designed the Matrix. Neo asks why is he there. The Architect explains that Neo is an anomaly he has been unable to remove. You haven't answered my question, Neo points out. The Architect confirms and mentions that he caught on faster than the others... The screens, showing Neo and expressing his thoughts, all express bewilderment by what the Architect means. The Matrix is older than you know, the Architect explains. Apparently this is the sixth version. Neo has trouble accepting, but concludes that either no one told me or no one knows.
Precisely. The anomaly is essential to the equations the Architect builds the Matrix from.
Choice, the problem is choice, Neo realizes.Just then Trinity is surprised by an Agent. She is no match for him and soon hits the floor.The Architect describes the first Matrix, which was perfect and therefore failed. The Architect tried again, making it reflect the human nature, but in vain. The problem was discovered by an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. The Oracle discovered (according to the Architect, by chance) that the humans had to be given choice. This leads them to Zion and Neo is with the Architect because it is about to be destroyed, a fact Neo cannot accept.The Architect simply points out that it is for the sixth time and they are getting better and better at it.Trinity continues to battle the Agent, but is slowly being defeated.The Architect explains that Neo must now return to the Source so that the prime program can be launched. Then he must choose 23 people to rebuild Zion. If he does not the Matrix will crash due to system failure, killing everyone connected. As Zion is about to be destroyed that would mean the end of the human race. Neo points out however that machines need humans to survive.There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept, the Architect claims. He doubts however that Neo will accept the extinction of all humans. The Architect elaborates that the five predecessors were designed to develop an attachment to their fellow human beings. Neo, on the other hand has a more specific aim for his affections.
Trinity! Neo exclaims in a whisper. The screens are showing her predicament, and the Architect reveals that she entered the Matrix to save his life. The Architect presents Neo with two doors. The one to his right leads to the Source, and the one on the left to Trinity and the downfall of man. The old man can tell that Neo's feelings are blinding him from the fact that Trinity will die either way. As the Oracle predicted, Neo goes to his left, only stopping to threaten the Architect that he better hope they don't meet again.
We won't, is the only reply.Back in the real world Morpheus is just coming out of the Matrix.
We have a problem, sir, says Link.
Oh, no, exclaims Morpheus as he sees Trinity connected.Trinity is still battling the Agent and jumps through the window and falls, the Agent close behind, and he shoots her as predicted in Neo's nightmares. Neo, flying faster than ever, catches her just in time, the agent hitting the car, crushing it. Neo lands on a rooftop with her and lays her down. She appears fatally wounded. Neo removes the bullet by manipulating the code of the Matrix, but Trinity's heart stops. Neo refused to accept her death. Reaching through the code of the Matrix, he compresses her heart and restarts it. She awakens with a start and they kiss passionately.
I guess this makes us even, she whispers.Morpheus fails to understand why the prophecy has not come true. Neo tells him and the others that they have 24 hours to save Zion and that the prophecy was just another form of control, a lie. Morpheus has major trouble accepting this, but before they can contemplate this complexity, their proximity alert sounds. The sentinels are just outside of EMP range. It's a bomb, says Neo. They flee.Keeping its distance, the sentinel they detected spins itself rapidly and releases a tow bomb that collides with the Neb. From a safe distance the crew see the Nebuchadnezzar blown apart by the powerful weapon.I have dreamed a dream, but now that dream has gone from me, Morpheus says, heartbroken.The Sentinels pursue them immediately and the humans run for their lives.

title: Dora the Explorer
synopsis: The series centers around Dora, a 7 (Later 8) year old American girl of Indigenous Mexican heritage, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red boots). Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora's travels, along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve (with assistance from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, the Spanish language, or counting. Common rituals may involve Dora's encounters with Swiper, a bipedal, anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall-breaking interaction with the viewer. To stop Swiper, Dora must say Swiper no swiping three times. However, on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people, the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items. Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program's antagonists; the Grumpy Old Troll dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross, who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer's help. Known for the constant breaking of the fourth-wall depicted in every episode, the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination, normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way. The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale, singing the We Did It! song with Boots in triumph.
On numerous occasions, television specials have been aired for the series in which the usual events of regular episodes are altered, threatened, or replaced. Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger, more whimsical adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled, or perhaps even offer a series of different adventures for Boots and Dora to travel through. They might be presented with an unusual, difficult task (such as assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus's Naughty List) that normally is not featured in average episodes, or challenge Dora with a goal that must be achieved (such as the emancipation of a trapped mermaid). Sometimes, the specials have involved the debut of new characters, such as the birth of Dora's superpowered twin baby siblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic stars that accompany Dora on many of her quests.

title: The I Inside
synopsis: Simon Cable (Ryan Phillipe) wakes with a start. Dr Newman (Stephen Rea) tries to calm him as Simon pulls at the tubes attached to his body. The doctor prescribes 5mg of diazepam. Simon is told he is in hospital and appears to have lost his memory after having been brought in the night before experiencing violent convulsions. He is told that he died and his heart stopped beating for 2 minutes. He will need to remain under observation for a few days. Dr Newman mentions that the hospital is short-staffed and that he is actually a paediatric doctor. He offers Simon a lollipop.Dr Newman tests Simon's memory and he remembers everything except for the past 2 years. He thinks he has woken up in 2000, but it is actually 2002 and he is told he is married to a woman named Anna who he does not recall.We cut to a montage of disorienting shots of Simon's POV from an accident. He is on the road looking at a man dash across the street in the pouring rain shouting, Back that truck up now! Get these cars out of here! We see flashing blue lights on a vehicle. An EMT runs up and asks, Are you alright? Are you ok? Take it easy man, I'm gonna take you on a little trip. He is rushed to the hospital and operated upon. A female voice says, His name is Simon Cable. Doctors start chest compressions as we hear a flatline and Simon's POV floats up and looks down on his body from the ceiling until the defibrillator brings him crashing back to earth.Just before Simon awakens startled yet again, a nurse mentions that she fears he might have been poisoned due to low Synoptic Cholinesterase. The doctor tells him he has short term memory loss and that they have to piece together the past like a puzzle (he has a puzzle in front of him). There's only one inescapable rule in the game of life, kid. Sooner or later everybody has to stop playing. He says further that Simon's wife may help him remember.A woman (Sarah Polley) is fresh-faced and appears suddenly, excited to see Simon. She is shocked to hear he has memory loss and does not remember her. She asks him if he is crazy, laments, I have nothing left, and leaves. Simon runs out after her and the orderly and Dr Newman stop him, saying that no-one has left his room. He turns to see a strange woman declare that the doctor has informed her about his condition. This is not the woman Simon saw just moments before in his room, but rather his wife Anna (Piper Perabo): mournful and distant.Anna and Simon sit with the doctor to piece together Simon's history. Anna says she was not with Simon the night before. Simon guesses that he must have been in the area visiting his brother, Peter (Robert Sean Leonard), who had moved into their deceased parents' estate recently. Anna reveals that Peter died before Anna and Simon met. They realise that Simon had gone to see Peter the night before his memory loss began. We see flashes of memories of car headlights, Simon driving in the rain, then an empty void. Anna reveals that he is thinking about a car accident which happened just before he met Anna. An orderly (Stephen Graham) walks past and winks. She says that this (St Judes) was the hospital he was brought to after his last accident. Anna says that 2 days previously Simon had come up to close up his parents' house which had been sitting empty. Dr Newman says that his low levels of enzymes indicate that he might have been poisoned by fumes from something like cleaning products.Dr Newman leaves the room and Anna slaps Simon telling him to drop the pretence. I knew you were a good liar but this performance is unbelievable...This is about her isn't it? Do you think she's really worth it? Simon is very confused. He stops her from leaving and asks about Peter's death. Of course he's dead, she says, you killed him.The orderly (Travis) enters the room saying it is time for Simon's MRI and Anna perks up again, giving him a kiss and smile goodbye. Travis says, Come on, home boy, I'm gonna take you on a little trip. Travis looks like he might be the EMT from earlier.During the MRI Travis asks Simon what would make someone want to kill him. Travis is doubtful that the cause might have been the cleaning chemicals. The biggest mystery there is is why and how someone dies, he says. Simon is left strapped to the MRI table and someone in scrubs enters but he cannot see who it is. The intruder does not respond to Simon's questions. The person injects Simon with something.Somebody help me! Simon cries. The room goes black and he wakes up in a hospital room with a couple of other patients. A doctor enters and Simon cries out that someone just tried to kill him. You wacko! one of the patients responds. This is St Jude's hospital, says the doctor and asks him if he knows why he is there. Simon says he was just strapped to an MRI table and the doctor denies that, telling him he was admitted the night before. He is told there is no Dr Newman on the St Jude's staff, that he has no wife and that he was admitted due to a car accident. He is told it is 2000. He runs to the MRI room and lounge and nothing is how it was the day before.The doctor suggests that it is possible he might be suffering from a preoccupied delusion, imagining a story while he was unconscious. Names from the two times sound familiar: The patient in his room in 2000 is Traffid, and the orderly's name in 2002 was Travis. He said he met Dr Newman in 2002, and this doctor's name is Truman. He sees Nurse Clayton arrive and is shocked to see her again as she was in in his dream (from 2002). Nurse Clayton re-emerges with Anna dressed as a nurse. One of the other patient's recognised Simon as the son of a dead senator. Simon becomes angrier and accuses everyone in the room of being in on a conspiracy. You're not real! he shouts as he is injected with a sedative.He wakes suddenly and he is back in 2002 strapped into the MRI machine, alone in the room. He sees the intruder in scrubs enter again with a syringe and calls for the doctor who arrives causing the intruder to hide behind a door. The doctor calls for more sedative. He tells Simon that he has been prescribed a drug that has mild psychiatric side effects and that he is paranoid as a result. The doctor and the nurse leave without looking for the intruder and Simon sees him hiding behind the door. He bangs on the table until a nurse appears. We see a closeup of the door handle and a shadow of someone passing back out. The nurse frees Simon who looks behind the door and no-one is there.De Newman does not believe Simon that someone tried to kill him. He shows him the security footage of the MRI room and there is no evidence of an intruder. The doctor says he recalls vaguely a Dr Truman and the orderly says that there is a patient named Traffid on the 5th floor who has been waiting for a heart transplant for 2 years.Simon races up to see Traffid, who remembers him as Wacko. Simon says that it proves that his dream was actually a memory.In the elevator on the way back to his room alone, the woman (who we know now as Clair), asks him where he has been. She regrets having run off but says that his words had felt cruel. He says it may take some time to remember and Clair says that they have time. I love you, she says before kissing him passionately. An orderly wheels a body into the elevator and they exchange a few words. He leaves and Clair explains that he doesn't love her. I know what we were and what you felt. It's just waiting to be remembered. Some things just don't get lost.Simon reaches out for Clair as she leaves and has a flashback of telling her he loves her. They explore a grand old house (presumably his parents') and she says the room they are in is her favourite room. We always have a choice, Simon, she says before embracing him. In the distance his brother, Peter, looks on, distraught. Back to the present moment, Simon admits to remembering loving Clair. Sometimes I can't help but think that we're paying for what happened, she says. Simon doesn't know what she means. He runs after her but she has mysteriously disappeared.He returns to his room and it is the year 2000 again - his roommates have returned. Dr Truman says Simon's brother is dead. He is told his brother was with him in the accident. Simon talks to Traffid about life and death.Dr Truman says Peter's fiancée is waiting. Anna is waiting in the dining room and says she has some questions for him about his brother's death, but is called away. Clair arrives - she is Peter's fiancée. He is shocked. He flashes back to greeting his brother. Back in the present 2000, Clair has disappeared and Anna re-emerges. She plays a recording of Peter saying, Simon did this to me. Simon killed me. Anna tries to convince Simon that he killed his brother. Simon is confused and uncertain. He realises Anna will try to blackmail him into marrying her.He runs out into the hall and suddenly emerges onto the driveway outside of his parents' house. He sees Clair driving down the driveway. He goes back inside and hears voices arguing: his brother and another man who sounds like him. The second man pushes his brother out of a window. Simon looks down on the body of his brother as a man who looks like Simon drags the body away and into a car. As they drive away Simon turns around and is attacked by the MRI room intruder dressed in scrubs.A series of images flashes before Simon's eyes and suddenly he is stabbing something bloody with a pair of scissors. He believes it is the intruder who is trying to kill him. We are back to the time period of 2000. The nurse enters the room and says he has stabbed Traffid. Simon, covered in blood, looks at the body and realises he has, in fact, killed Traffid, and not the intruder. He runs away into the morgue. He see security guards chasing after him on the CCTV. He bumps into Anna who laughs. He runs away and is hounded by the security guards. He runs through a door only to be pushed back by the orderly, Travis, and his shirt has magically been removed of all blood.He goes back up to Traffid's room and finds him alive. Suddenly Traffid starts bleeding at the site of the original wounds given him by old mate. Traffid is soaked in blood. Simon collapses in a corner screaming, I killed him!We move Simon;s memory of putting his brother's body in a car on a dark night. He releases the brake and is about to send it off a cliff when the headlights of a truck pull up. He scrambles to stop the car moving, and he drives away. The screen fades to red. Jesus! Simon says.He finds the nurse asking her about Peter's death. She says that all his injuries were so severe he had to be put on life support where he died. Anna appears and she is bleeding (similarly to the injury she sustained in their fight in 2000 when she begins blackmailing Simon). She asks if they are clear on the terms of their arrangement. None of this is going to happen, Simon declares. The thing is Simon: it happened, she retorts.Simon tries to go back in time to change the past. He goes back to the night with Clair in his parents' house where he told Clair he loved her, in her favourite room. He sits Clair down and says,  We do have a choice...as much as I love you Clair, he is my brother, I just can't do this to him. Peter sees them, distraught. Clair runs after him and Peter tells her to leave. Simon runs out into the driveway after Clair but she drives off. Simon goes back upstairs to his brother.They fight and in trying to stop Peter, Simon pushes him out the window. He drags Peter to the car and stops at the crossroads. Left goes to Vista Point where he tried to get rid of his brother's body the last time and right to the hospital. Simon stops and then turns right.It starts to rain heavily. A car starts to tailgate him, flashing its lights and hooting. You're gonna be alright, Pete, says Simon, there won't be an accident. Peter wakes up suddenly and distracts Simon who looks away from the road. He looks up again as his car crashes into Clair's car.In the aftermath of the accident, we see the EMT's place a sheet over Clair's body, and an EMT tends to Peter. We see that it is a woman who looks identical to Anna. Blue lights flash atop a vehicle. Another EMT rushes up to Simon and asks if he is ok. Take it easy now man, I'm going to take you on a little trip. he says.It is day again. Simon walks into his parents' house. He meets Peter inside the room Clair loved so much. Peter says eerily, as he stokes his fire, I wanted a fire and thought why not? Am learning to live a little. The brothers embrace. They have reconciled. Simon asks Peter to tell him what happened as he has forgotten. I think you know exactly what happened. It's just too tough for you to face, says Peter. He reveals that on the night of the accident Clair had turned around and was coming back for Simon.We hear Clair's voice repeating, I can't help but think that we're paying for what happened.Simon looks over at the family photographs and sees a photo of the two boys with their dad: who is identical to Dr Newman. We hear Dr Newman's voice: There's only one inescapable rule in the game of life, kid. Sooner or later everybody has to stop playing.Simon is confused. He knows something is wrong. This is your choice, Simon, says Peter, You need to leave this behind you, Simon, for Clair, for me, for Dad. You died, Simon. We all did. And you can't move on from all of this until you let go. Let it go. Simon cannot. He says he needs another chance.Simon revives with the EMT on the road and we see a flash of Travis. We see a patient walk by him on the way in to the emergency room and we see a flash of Traffid. We see a flash of the female EMT and a flash of Anna.Simon is looking down on his body from the ceiling as he floats away.It's your choice, Simon, where you go.The doctor declares the time of death: Simon stops breathing at 20:00. Time of death 20:02.Simon zooms back into his body and we are back at the first scene of the movie. Simon awakens with a start and the doctor prescribes him 5mg of diazepam.The doctor tells him where he is and says:You died, Mr Cable.

title: Pennies from Heaven
synopsis: As the opening credits roll, the audience hears The Clouds Will Soon Roll By, a typical Great Depression-era type lyric, while the audience watches a rain storm. The time and place is set as 1934 Chicago.
As the action begins, an alarm clock wakes Arthur Parker (Steve Martin), who rolls over to wake his wife, Joan (Jessica Harper), by trying to interest in some early morning sex, but his shy, practically frigid wife turns him down. Arthur is frustrated by his wife's disinterest in sex. While he dresses for work, he lip-syncs I'll Never Have to Dream Again to a female voice (Connee Boswell). The song continues during breakfast with Arthur singing for himself. In addition to Arthur's sexual disappointments, he is further frustrated because his wife will not finance the start of his own business.
Arthur leaves home that morning and threatens never to return. He goes to a bank to borrow enough money to start a sheet music store. With no collateral, the banker (Jay Garner) refuses to loan him any money. During moments when his dreams are shattered, Arthur shuts out reality by escaping into Busby Berkeley-like musical production numbers. In this particular instance, Arthur and the banker lip-synch the lyrics to Yes, Yes! (My Baby Said Yes), performed by Sam Browne and the Carlyle Cousins. They are joined by several chorus girls who tap dance and toss large cardboard coins. During the song Arthur is showered with bags of coins and the song develops into a huge production number complete with over-heard camera shots of dancers in kaleidoscopic patterns and the dancers reflected in a highly polished, mirror-like floor. During one sequence, the banker and Arthur are dressed in cut-away suits and dance with a chorus line of girls.
The scene changes to Arthur driving down the road where he picks up a hitch hiker, the Accordion Man (Vernal Bagneris).
Later, while Arthur sells some sheet music to the owner of Barrett's Music Shop, Eileen (Bernadette Peters) enters. Even though she is a shy, rather plain school teacher, Arthur expresses his instant attraction to her by singing Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?(performed by Bing Crosby). During the number, Eileen is converted into a lovelier version of herself and performs a tap dance routine. She leaves the store without paying much attention to Arthur.
As she walks down the street, Eileen hears the Accordion Man singing Rock of Ages and gives him a contribution, which prompts him to launch into a spirited rendition of The Old Rugged Cross.
Soon, the hitch hiker devours some food at Jimmy's Diner, an Italian-American food joint. He and Arthur are sitting together in a booth, but Arthur isn't eating. As he gives his meal to the enigmatic bum, the diner walls disappear and Arthur walks out into the rain and dances to a violin solo of Pennies from Heaven (the violin soloist is uncredited; the song is sung by Arthur Tracy, who was called The Street Singer). The rain drops become coins raining down as he dances in front of a huge backdrop collage depicting various scenes from the Great Depression.
After the song, Arthur gives the Accordion Man a quarter, leaves the diner and heads for Eileen's farm. He had learned she was a school teacher, so he asked some children where she lived. Although Eileen is frightened at first, she listens as he expresses his infatuation with her.
The scene changes to a bar where a couple of other salesmen are lamenting the depression economics, but Arthur, smiling, claims he's doing great (referring more to his progress with Eileen than his sales). He and the other salesmen perform a vaudeville act-type rendition of It's the Girl (performed by the Boswell Sisters with the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra) which includes a tap dance routine and Arthur performing a short banjo solo.
The following scene shows Eileen reading the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Rapunzel to her school class. Suddenly, the children are dressed in all white and their desks become small white grand pianos on which they accompany their teacher as she sings Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You (performed by Phyllis Robins with Nicholas Orlando's Orchestra). The children also tap dance on top of their pianos. Back to reality, the school's principal scolds them for making so much noise.
Arthur is waiting outside when school is dismissed, to drive Eileen home. During their visit, Arthur makes the mistake of saying, My wife, but he quickly tries to cover up by claiming his wife was killed in a motorcycle accident. Then, he plays on Eileen's sympathy by asking her to take the pain away.
When he returns home to his wife, Joan gives into one of Arthur's sexual fetishes by putting lipstick on her nipples. Once he entices her to reveal them to him, she cries and asks Are they as nice as hers? He lies to her and claims that even though he has been tempted when he is out on the road, he has refrained.
We hear the radio play Let's Put Out the Lights (and Go to Sleep) while Arthur talks about wanting to play the sax and have his own dance band.
The next morning, Arthur is happy he's had sex with his wife and she has finally agreed to finance his record shop. While he dresses, Joan sings It's a Sin to Tell a Lie (performed by Rudy Vallee and His Connecticut Yankees). During the song, she picks up a pair of scissors to stab him in the back, but it is only an illusion -she is actually still in bed. It is what she would like to do if she had the nerve.
After some time passes, Eileen is fired from her teaching position because she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Arthur has opened his record store but is languishing with few customers. One evening he drives to a bridge where he sees a girl walking towards him. He speaks to her and determines that she is blind. He offers to walk with her (with an implied sexual context) and compliments her beauty.
Later, he goes to Eileen, who informs him she is going to have his baby. She forces him to write down his address so that she'll know where to find him. He promises to do what he can to help. One of the things that attracts him most about Eileen is that she isn't shocked by his sexual suggestions; rather, she seems to relish them. In this instance, he tells her about a man giving an elevator operator $20 to turn his back so he and his date can have sex. When she likes the idea, Arthur is thrilled. She sings I Want to Be Bad (performed by Helen Kane, the Boop-Boop-a-Doop girl) as they act out their sexual fantasy in an elevator. In the following scene, the blind girl Arthur had met earlier stumbles over the bum Arthur had picked up earlier in the film. Although the film audience doesn't see the act, the bum rapes and kills the girl.
Later, as Arthur returns from his tryst with Eileen, he happens upon the crime scene and sees the blind girl dead. We see a Camel cigarette package that will later be used as evidence against Arthur. During this sequence, we hear a reprise of The Clouds Will Soon Roll By playing in the background. As Arthur leaves the crime scene, he almost runs over the vagrant who committed the crime.[I could be wrong, but the way I remember it, Arthur does hit the vagrant, killing him and throwing his body into some bushes where presumably it is never found--isaiah53-5].Back home, Arthur is so shaken by what he has seen that he promises Joan that he will change and will be good in the future.
Eileen wanders into a bar where she orders lemonade, but Tom (Christopher Walken), a stylish pimp, talks her into adding gin to her lemonade. She offers herself to him for $5 and tells him her name is Lulu. Tom and three of his cronies perform a song and dance routine to Let's Misbehave (performed by Irving Aaronson and His Commanders). During the number, a couple of elderly whores join Tom and he and Lulu tap dance on top of the bar.
Soon, Arthur realizes his life with Joan is over. The film audience sees Arthur, Joan and Eileen dressed in sailor outfits sing Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries (performed by Walt Harrah, Gene Merlino, Vern Rowe, Robert Tebow and Al Vescovo) into a radio microphone.
One evening as Arthur is leaving his record store he hears Eileen laughing, goes over to her and offers to buy her a cup of coffee. During their conversation, she reveals that she aborted the baby. When he takes her to his record shop, she further reveals that she has become a prostitute and enjoys it. Arthur admits that he should have held on to her, but he was too obsessed with owning a record store. Once they both realize they are still in love with each other, they decide to run away together. Before they go, they smash all the records in the store except for Pennies from Heaven. Arthur won't allow her to break that one.
The police question Joan and tell her that Arthur closed the store and was seen at a bar with a prostitute. When they tell her that her husband is a suspect in a murder case, she reveals that he traveled to Chicago and back at the time of the murder.
One evening, Eileen and Arthur go to movies to see Follow the Fleet (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers perform an excerpt of Lets Face the Music and Dance from the film). Soon, Arthur mimes Astaire and he and Eileen walk up on the stage in front of the screen and dance like Fred and Ginger. Suddenly, Arthur and Eileen are transformed into a black and white film sequence in which they dance with a chorus of male dancers. At the end of the dance, the males canes become the bars of a jail cell.
When they leave the movie theater, Eileen and Arthur see a newspaper headline about the blind girl being murdered. As Arthur feverishly drives away, he tries to get Eileen to believe he is innocent of the crime. Abruptly, Eileen tells Arthur goodbye. He asks if she is running out on him, to which she replies, Not fun, is it?
The next morning, while Arthur is trying to get his car started, the cops arrive. He runs, but they catch him. Even though he pleads his innocence, he is convicted. At the gallows, he quotes the verse of Pennies from Heaven and then sings the chorus (in this instance, Steve Martin is actually singing).
As Eileen looks out a window, Arthur, still dressed in his prison clothes, comes running back calling her name. She can't understand why he is there: he has just witnessed his execution. He says, Whoever said you could stop a dream? We couldn't go through all that without a happy ending. That line leads into the finale, which is a huge Busby Berkeley-type production number to The Glory of Love. The number opens with a stage full of chorus girls who are seated and kicking their legs. Soon, Eileen and Arthur, dressed in new costumes, enter and sing (in this instance, both Bernadette Peters and Steve Martins own voices are heard). Towards the end of the number a rainbow appears in the sky and the camera pans up through the clouds to a fair sky and a full moon.
During the end credits, renditions of Pennies from Heaven and Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You are heard.

title: Where Eagles Dare
synopsis: It is the winter of 1944. A lone transport plane, in German Luftwaffe insignia, picks its way through the peaks of the Bavarian Alps by night. Inside, seven paratroopers, in German Fallschirmjaeger uniform, wait in grim silence for the jump signal. Among them is their leader, Major Smith (Richard Burton) and his junior officer, Lieutenant Schaeffer (Clint Eastwood). The others: Christiansen (Donald Houston), Barkely (Peter Barkworth), Thomas (William Squire), Mac Pherson (Neil Mc Carthy) and Harrod (Brook Williams) are enlisted men. In the silent tension, Major Smith ponders his mission briefing.Flashing back to headquarters in London, the Fallschirjaeger paratroops turn out to be a team of highly trained British MI6 agents (except for Shaeffer, who is on loan from the American OSS). Briefed by intelligence chief, Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern), and his executive officer, Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark), the team's mission is to rescue a captured American, General Carnaby (Robert Beatty), an Allied planner for Operation Overlord (D-Day). The General's plane has been shot down, and he is being held prisoner at the Schloss Adler (Castle of Eagles), an impregnable mountain-top fortress that also serves as headquarters for the German Alpine Korps. The prisoner must be rescued before he can divulge any information about Operation Overlord.Back in the present, the plane reaches its drop zone and the seven commandos parachute into a snow-covered mountain wilderness. Unseen by any of the men, a mysterious woman, also in Fallschirmjaeger gear, emerges from the planes cargo compartment and jumps after them. Smith's team gathers on their landing zone, only to find that their radioman, Harrod, is missing. After a quick search, he is found dead, his neck apparently broken in the drop. However, Major Smith is suspicious. Though the radioman's neck is bruised, there are no logs or large rocks buried beneath the snow to account for such an injury. He keeps silent, however, about his misgivings, and the group carries on to shelter in a high Alpine farmhouse that remains unoccupied in winter.Once there, Smith claims he's forgotten the code books carried by the dead radioman and goes back out into the night to get them, but instead detours around to the barn where he meets the mystery woman from the plane, Mary (Mary Ure). They obviously know each other very well, and after an hour of her company, Smith returns to the farmhouse. A skeptical Lt. Schaffer sits there patiently waiting, cleaning his gun, He obviously doesn't believe a word of Smith's story, but says nothing.The next day, the team climbs over the next ridge in the mountains, and see the Schloss-Adler castle on a peak across the valley. Waiting until dusk, they descend and sneak into the village at the base of the mountain. Changing into Wermacht uniforms, they bluff their way into the village and enter an inn, listening for information on Gen. Carnaby. Smith has a coded exchange with the barmaid (who turns out to be a British agent as well), and shortly thereafter meets both her and Mary in the woodshed behind the inn. He explains that he's in a hurry to get into the castle above because the Germans don't really have an American General, but instead have an impersonator named Cartright Jones who knows nothing about the second front. Astonished, Mary can't believe they've gone to all this trouble to rescue an imposter, but Smith has no time for further explanations, and produces forged papers that will get Mary into the castle that night with a new job as a servant.Exiting the woodshed, Smith finds another member of his team murdered, laying in the snow behind a scout car. He rejoins Schaffer in the inn, who has had enough of Smith's deceptions, and demands to be told the real story behind this mission, or he's out. As Smith starts to explain, the SS bursts in, capturing Smith, Schaffer and the other three agents. Smith and Schaffer are driven away in a staff car, while the other three men are taken away for questioning. Mary meanwhile rides the cable car up to the castle and begins to make her preparations.A mile from the village, Schaffer and Smith manage to start a fight in the car and to kill the German soldiers. They hike back to the village, pick up their hidden gear, blow up a warehouse as a diversion, steal a motorcycle and drive back out of the village along the road to the airport. They install small bombs on the telephone poles along the road, and rig trip wires to snow-poles along the road edge. Returning once more to the village, they find their three fellow agents being led into the cable car for a trip up to the castle, and make their way quickly up onto the roof of the terminal. As the car pulls out, Smith and Schaffer climb onto its roof, riding unseen up to the castle.After a harrowing ride on top of the cable car, they leap to the ledge above the terminal and claw their way up. Far above, Mary lowers a rope from a castle window, and they climb up the cliff face. Laying their final plans, Smith and Schaffer quietly make their way to the castle's great hall, where the Germans are talking to Carnaby over brandy and cigars. Since he politely but firmly refuses to tell them anything, they must regrettably resort to Scopolamine to get the information they want. The three captured members of Smith's rescue team are also brought in, and it is revealed that they are really double agents, posing as British but working for the Germans. As they are about to inject the fake General with truth serum, Smith quietly walks up out of the shadows surprising everyone, and declares that the double agents are still lying. Smith himself is tracking them, and he is really working for SS Military Intelligence. Pointing his gun at an astonished Schaffer, Smith tells him to sit down and shut up.Smith goes on to prove his true loyalties to the German High Command, and manages to convince the three traitors that they have been trapped. Desperate to prove they are really on the same side, they write down all the info they have on Nazi agents working in England. Smith gathers this up and asks German Col. Kramer (Anton Diffring) to review it, then quietly signals Schaffer to get ready. Compare their notes with my original, he tells Kramer, handing him another notebook. Leafing through it, Kramer finds all the pages are blank, and is stunned by the realization that Smith had duped them all. He really is a British agent, and has tricked the Nazis into revealing their entire spy network in England.In the ensuing confusion, Smith and Schaffer (who tells Smith that he's about as confused as I ever hope to be) battle their way back out of the castle and onto the cable car. Escaping back down to the village, they highjack a large bus and speed out of town with the Germans in hot pursuit. Tripping the bombs they'd laid ealier as they drive by, the telephone poles are blasted in half and fall to block the road. The Germans are slowed but not stopped, and use dynamite of their own to blast through the obstacles. The team manages to beat them to the airport, where the same plane that had flown them in now swoops down and lands, allowing them to clamber in and escape through a hail of gunfire.Taking a long sigh of relief, they sit back as they're met in the plane by the man who'd sent them on this mission, Col. Turner (Patrick Wymark), second in command of British Intelligence. As he reviews the list of agents in disbelief, as Smith calmly tells Turner that there's one name that isn't on the list: that of the top German agent in England, confirmed by Colonel Kramer back at the castle. He shows the note to Turner, who shoots an alarmed look back at Smith.It's your own name Colonel, he says. Don't look so surprised.Pointing a gun at Smith, Turner calmly tries to talk his way out, but cannot. When in desperation he pulls the trigger to shoot Smith, the gun doesn't fire; Smith had removed to firing pin before the mission. With no cards left to play and facing certain hanging, Turner, sweat beading on his forehead, calmly asks if there is an alternative.Do you want it? asks Smith.Turner nods. He slowly gets up, walks to the door in the rear of the plane and opens it. Taking a last bitter look at Smith, he jumps to his death.Is that it Major? asks Schaffer tiredly as he replaces the door.Yes, that's it, replies Smith. He leans back in his seat and closes his eyes. The plane lumbers on through the night, returning to England.

title: I.Q.
synopsis: During the film opening, we see a man, presumably Einstein (Walter Mathau) playing a violin, as another man walks past a poster advertising Boyd's comet. We then see Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) with her fiance James Moreland (Stephen Fry). She's working on some math referring to the comet. He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men), whether there are 'accidents' and he says, I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.Catherine and James pull into a garage, where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss, Bob (Tony Shalhoub), about the car they hear coming into the shop, what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is, based on what they can hear. Bob sends out Ed to check because he sees the couple and assumes they're college people meaning they come from Princeton College. As soon as Ed sees Catherine, he falls for her.James, obnoxiously asks if someone there can work on a British engine, and Ed says, May I look under the bonnet? James, reassured by the use of the word 'bonnet' consents. Ed looks at it, looks at Catherie and pronounces, You have no spark. There's clearly a double meaning here, referring to her relationship with James. James insists, But what's wrong with it? and Ed adds, My guess is that you have a short stroke and premature ignition. He turns to Meg Ryan and says, Does it ever feel that way? She replies, I'm sure I don't know what you mean but it's clear that she gets the double entendre. Ed says he'll go check with his boss about fixing it, and goes in to tell his boss that he's in love, that time and space stopped, that he could see himself kissing Catherine in the future. Ed tells Catherine that fixing the car will take days, and she uses his phone to call a cab, giving the cab company and Ed her address for the invoice. In the process, she leaves behind a pocket watch. There's a brief moment where you see a hand move the watch under some magazines, but whose hand? And is it an accident? Or deliberate? The theme of accident versus deliberate intervention occurs repeatedly in the film.Ed goes to return the pocket watch and discovers that the address is the home of Albert Einstein, who is Catherine's uncle. Ed helps Einstein and his friends retrieve a badminton racket and in the process befriends them. It's clear to them that Ed likes Catherine. Einstein sees that his niece is unhappy with her fiance and wonders how to help Ed date her. She will only date a very intelligent man, and Ed is an auto mechanic. Ed says, That's easy, lend me your brain for a couple of days. Einstein gets an idea.Einstein and his three friends hatch a plot to make Catherine think that Ed has developed cold fusion as a way to power a rocket to reach the stars so she'll desire him. They help Ed appear hyper-intelligent, helping him present a paper on cold fusion at a symposium and then helping him pass an IQ test administered by Catherine's fiance. Catherine, as a mathematician, is trying to figure out Ed's theory on cold fusion, but she struggles with it. Ed wants to tell Catherine he's a fake, but he can't quite seem to. Einstein and his buddies interfere with Catherine's relationship with James, and encourage Ed. James is presented as a sadistic, sexually cold man who puts Catherine down subtly.Of course, there's always a happily-ever-after ending, even though it takes President Eisenhower's appearance in the film, a convertible, a motorcycle, waltz music, engineered automotive troubles and a comet, to make it all come about.

title: The Twilight Saga: Eclipse
synopsis: Eclipse opens at nighttime where Riley Biers (Xavier Samuel) is exiting a store on his way home. A driving rainstorm begins as he walks on his way. Without warning, he is knocked down. Looking around, startled, he cannot see anyone-- the street he is walking down appears completely deserted. Getting scared, he pulls his coat closer and picks up his pace. Just as suddenly he is hurled through the air and against a wall-- and still there is nobody and nothing in side. Riley starts to yell for help and breaks into a run. He gets too close to a pier on a marina and almost falls into the water. Terrified, he screams out to his unseen assailant what he wants. There is a blur as something rushes past far too quickly to be seen, and Riley's hand is wounded. He screams in agony and falls to the ground-- and the wound on his hand strongly resembles some kind of bite wound.Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are in a meadow where she is reading from Fire & Ice in preparation for an English final. Edward again asks Bella to marry him, and runs into the old impasse-- he asks her, marry me, and Bella responds with, change me. Finally Edward offers a compromise where he will change her when they're married. Bella kisses him but then says it's more like coercion. Their views om marriage differ and she teases him about the divorce rate. Edward assures her that the vampire-human divorce rate is lower. They kiss more and Bella says she's due back home at four. Edward just smiles as she gathers up her things and starts on her way home.Charlie (Billy Burke) is reading the newspaper headline that discusses a rash of murders in Seattle. Bella arrives home exactly at four like Charlie wanted. There is a bit of brief debate about her being grounded for life (as in New Moon) and Charlie admits that he would like to see a bit of separation between Bella and Edward, even though he expects her answer that Edwart is part of her life. So Charlie offers her a deal. He'll end her punishment if she agrees to see some of her other friends as well, and suggests she see Jacob, as Billy has told Charlie that Jacob is going through a very rough time lately, and just a short time ago, when Bella was in that position, Jake was there for her when she needed him. Bella calls Jacob but gets his voice-mail and chooses not to leave a message. A voiceover from Bella explains that Jacob hasn't spoken to her in weeks, and she's been hoping to set things right. She pulls a handwritten letter out of her dresser drawer and looks at it briefly.Bella gets into her truck to drive to the reservation, but it won't start. Suddenly Edward is in the passenger seat. He knows she was heading to the reservation, and Bella realizes that Alice saw it, and that Edward rigged her truck to not be able to start, in order to prevent her from driving there. They argue about her seeing Jacob. She is adamant that she has until graduation but Edward is obsessed with her safety and is convinced she won't have any among the Quileutes.The next day at school, during lunch, Edward joins Bella at her main table with Mike (Michael Welch), Eric (Justin Chon), Jessica (Anna Kendrick) and Angela (Christian Serratos). Jessica is the class valedictorian and Mike and Eric are helping her prepare her speech. Alice (Ashley Greene) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) join them all as well, and Alice stuns them all with an announcement that she is going to host a graduation party-- at the Cullen home. Jessica and Angela are pleasantly shocked, as nobody has ever been to the Cullen home before (except Bella of course). Suddenly Alice sits back with a worried look on her face, and Bella quickly realizes she's having a vision of something. But neither she, Jasper nor Edward will discuss it with her.Edward drives Bella to the police station where Charlie is on duty. They see him with Riley Biers' parents discussing his 'missing persons' case-- Riley has been missing for a year now. Bella realizes Edward knows something about it, and he tells her that the Cullens have been paying very close attention to the rise of murders and disappearances in Seattle. They suspect vampires and believe that if the crime wave escalates, the Voluri will take action. Bella is worried that the Volturi will then make their way to Forks and see that she is still human, but Edward assures her it won't come to that. The Cullens are prepared to go to Seattle if need be to try and get to the bottom of things themselves.As Riley's parents exit the station, Charlie comes out as well. Edward tells Charlie that Carlisle and Esme have bought a plane ticket for Bella to fly down to Jacksonville for a few days to visit her mother Renee. Charlie is surprised but agrees to the visit. Bella is reluctant until it is revealed that Edward will be going with her. This Charlie doesn't like so much but he still consents to the trip.Bella is in Jacksonville laying in the sun with her mother Renee (Sarah Clarke). They are talking about her college plans. Renee hopes Bella will consider a college in Florida, both because it will let her see her daughter more, and because Bella was always a sun-lover. Bella is planning to attend college in Alaska, saying they have a good science program, but Renee knows better-- she knows Bella is in love with Edward and wants to follow him. Finally Renee gives Bella her graduation present-- she collected college T-shirts from every state and sewn them together into a quilt for Bella. Bella is touched and hugs Renee gratefully.Back in Forks, it is nighttime and the Cullens are standing watch in the forest. Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) asks Alice if she's certain this is the spot in her vision. Alice is certain, and they keep watch. Suddenly Alice alerts them to look to their left. The Cullens all take off in pursuit, and it is seen they are chasing Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard); Alice had foreseen her return to Forks. Emmett (Kellan Lutz) nearly catches Victoria but she wriggles free and keeps running with the Cullens in hot pursuit. Finally Victoria leaps across a stream-- into Quileute territory, where the Cullens are under treaty not to venture. Victoria and the Cullens continue running down opposite sides of the stream when the Quileute wolf pack, having smelled Victoria's presence, emerges from the trees in pursuit of Victoria. Looking to pit one side against the other, Victoria cleverly leaps back and forth from one bank of the stream to the other. Both sides narrowly miss catching her. Finally Emmett loses his patience and jumps after her onto the Quileute lands. Victoria's plan pays off as Paul (Alex Meraz) moves to block Emmett from crossing into Quileute territory. So intent is Paul on not letting Emmett pass that Victoria escapes from both sides in the confusion.Edward and Bella have returned to Forks and are driving to school. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is there waiting. He confronts Edward about the Cullens trespassing on Quileute territory. Naturally Bella wants to know what Jacob is talking about, and Edward evasively says that Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding. Jacob is amused despite his anger and finally helps Bella put two and two together-- Alice's vision in the lunchroom was Victoria's return to Forks, and Carlisle and Esme bought her the plane ticket to Florida to get her out of town so she would be safe from Victoria. Bella is furious at Edward's lie, but also confronts Jacob on not caling her. He says he had nothing to say, and Bella says she has plenty. She climbs on Jacob's motorcycle behind him despite Edward's protest and rides with him to the reservation.Some of the wolf pack members are there to greet them on their arrival, teasing Jacob about his continuous thoughts about whether Bella would call him, and whether or not he should call her. Bella then meets Leah Clearwater (Julia Jones), Harry Clearwater's daughter. On Leah's shoulder is both the mark of a Quileute wolf-pack member... and a chip larger than Bella's truck.Sam Uley (Chaske Spencer), the leader of the wolf-pack, and his fiance Emily (Tinsel Korey) emerge from the house. Emily goes to hug Bella as Sam and Jacob talk about Victoria's return. Sam assures Jacob that Victoria won't get through their line again. As they enter the house, Bella glances over her shoulder to see Leah assume wolf form and practice the cliff-dive.Bella and Jacob are talking later. Jacob explains how Leah and her younger brother Seth gained the gift of the 'spirit warrior' (ability to assume wolf form) after Harry died. Jacob also explains that Leah was once in love with Sam, and he loved her in return, until Emily came into the tribe's life. Jacob explains to Bella, the Quileute wolf-pack's process of 'imprinting' on someone-- an event that bonds a male and female as complete soulmates. The imprinting process is often very sudden, spontaneous, and beyond the control of the wolf-pack member doing the imprinting. As all the wolf-pack members can always hear each other's thoughts, they always have to live with the pain Leah feels about losing Sam, and Sam's guilt over imprinting on someone else after he and Leah had grown so close. Bella begins to suspect that Jacob has imprinted on her, but Jacob says that if he'd imprinted on anyone, Bella would know it for certain. He's still him, and as he says, Bella is still Bella. But when Bella says, 'until graduation,' Jacob realizes that Bella intends to go through with becoming a vampire, which sickens him beyond belief. In a fit of disgust he voices a preference for Bella to die rather than let her become something that is unnatural and neither dead nor alive. Quickly he curses himself for going too far, looking painfully stricken at Bella's expression of indignant anger.At the Swan house, Riley is in Bella's room. He fingers the dreamcatcher on her bed and steals one of her red blouses, sniffing it closely. Stealthily descending the stairs, he passes Charlie asleep on the couch and bends over him as if to feed on him. But Riley then hears the door open, and using his speed, escapes from the house undetected.Bella comes into the house, and Charlie is pleased when Bella tells him she was with Jacob and not Edward. But suddenly there is a knock at the door and both of them realize it's Edward. Bella steps outside to greet him, but he is deeply concerned. He almost broke the treaty to make sure she was okay. Suddenly he smells something and rushes up to her room. Fingering her dreamcatcher, he tells her that someone's been in her room.Edward brings Bella back to his house. Edward didn't recognize the scent of whoever entered Bella's room. The Cullens have scouted around the area and determined that the scent vanished five miles south of Bella's house. They suspect a nomad vampire might be involved, as Alice would have seen a vision of Victoria. They suspect the Volturi might be involved, but Alice disagrees, saying she's also been watching Aro, the Volturi ruler, through her visions.The Cullens are discussing another round of protection vigils over Bella's house (to the displeasure of Rosalie (Nikki Reed)). Bella knows that the Cullens cannot keep watch over her and Charlie, and still search for both Victoria and the mysterious intruder, all while keeping themselves fed.It is dayime and Bella has brought Jacob to her house so he can get the scent of the intruder. Outside Jacob tells Edward that he will know the scent if he crosses it again. Edward refuses to trust Jacob and Bella has to force herself between them to break them apart. A voiceover from Bella explains the extremely uneasy partnership between the Cullens and the Quileute wolf-pack, as they guard the house in shifts-- the wolves relieving the Cullens at intervals so they can hunt for animal blood to feed on (two wolves are seen relieving Alice and Emmett as Bella watches).Edward and Bella go to meet Jacob on the shoulder of a road through the woods. Edward is dropping Bella off to spend some time on the Quileute reservation. Despite the partnership, the antipathy between Edward and Jacob drips out of the very air between them whenever they are face to face. Edward passionately kisses Bella goodbye in front of Jacob, and Jacob in turns gives Bella an affectionate hug before Edward drives off.Jacob brings Bella to attend a meeting of the Quileute tribal council. Some of the younger pack members are attending, including Seth (BooBoo Stewart), who Bella meets for the first time. Seth's mother, Sue Clearwater, is on the council now after the death of her husband Harry. Bella is to attend the gathering as the first person not of the tribe to hear the tribe's histories.Billy Black (Gil Birmingham) recites a story of the Quileute tribe as spirit warriors; shapeshifters; able to assume the form of a powerful wolf. He tells of the tribe's first encounter with one of the Cold Ones. Two spirit warriors vanquished one of them after it had fed on some of the tribe. But the Cold One vanquished had a mate (like Victoria was the mate of James) and she attacked the village in vengeance. The Tribal Elder, Taha Aki, engaged her in combat. The Cold Woman was winning the battle and seemed poised to kill him, when Taha Aki's third wife, who had no powers and could not join the battle, stabbed herself with a knife so the Cold Woman would smell the blood and be distracted, allowing Taha Aki to recover and slay her. Taha Aki's third wife is celebrated as a heroine of the tribe for her selfless courage; her sacrifice of herself saved the village and the people. The Cold Ones are the only remaining enemy of the Quileute people. The magic in the tribe's blood awakens when they are near. Billy warns that conflict is near... and the tribe must be ready to face it.In Seattle, Riley is watching over a small scene of violence and Mayhem. He bends over a teenage girl, Bree (Jodelle Ferland), who we see has just been changed into a vampire. Bree is confused and terrified over her new state, and Riley only tells her he'll find her someone to drink and suggests she try not to get killed.Back at the Cullen home, Edward is arriving with Bella. They find Carlisle, Jasper and Emmett watching a news report about the escalating violence in Seattle; the rise in killings and disappearances. Jasper knows that no one vampire could cause such destruction. The Cullens realize that the culprits are newborns, which they explain to Bella is the state when a human is first transformed into a vampire; their first few months as one. This is when a vampire is at their most vicious, uncontrolled state, overwhelmed with a wild thirst for blood. The newborns are completely undisciplined. Jasper and Carlisle deduce that someone is creating a small army of them. This means they must go to Seattle to try and stop it. The newborns are being created to destroy someone or something-- the Cullens are the only vampire family close enough to be targets. Carlisle knows that if the Cullens don't stop the newborns, the Volturi will arrive to do so-- he's surprised they haven't stepped in yet. Edward theorizes that the Volturi are actually behind the uprising; he knows that Aro and Marcus dearly want for both himself and Alice to join them, and if the rest of the Cullen family were slain, they would have nobody else to go to.Bella is arriving home to find her father looking at a missing persons poster for Riley, made by his parents when he first vanished. Charlie notes that they are still desperate to find their son even after a year. Bella wonders why they keep looking, and Charlie answers that he would do so in their place, if it were Bella that was missing.At night, Bella is lying beside Edward in her bed. Despite her determination to become a vampire, she is coming to terms with knowing she can never see her family or the rest of her friends again, as her body will never age and she will appear 18 years old even when she's supposed to be 40. Edward uses this as more ammo in the argument not to change her. He warns her that he's been through the consequences she will face for undergoing the change. She believes that Edward has a soul, but he doesn't, and he cannot bear the thought of taking her soul away just so she wouldn't grow old and die as his mortal wife. Even though he'd eventually lose her, he feels that taking her soul away would be the most selfish act he could do.The next day Bella is on the reservation with Jacob, admiring the beauty of the land. She invites him to the graduation party, though she is not surprised at his lack of an answer; going to the Cullen home is the last thing on his 'to-do' list. Bella notes there's something on his mind. Jacob says he didn't want to be so forward, but there's no time left; she needs to hear the truth. Jacob confides that he is in love with Bella, and he is fighting for her heart; he desperately hopes she will choose him over Edward. He puts her hand on his chest so she can feel his heart beating and that he is a living being of warm flesh and blood. With him, Bella would never need to change; she would never need to give up being human or say goodbye to her family. Bella tries to explain that she doesn't feel that way for him, but Jacob doesn't buy it; he is convinced she just doesn't want to admit it to herself. He intends to fight for her until her heart stops beating, and is visibly pained at her response that he wouldn't be waiting for long. Jacob says that unlike Edward, he can kiss her without fear of hurting her. But Jacob goes too far when he grabs Bella and passionately kisses her to demonstrate his point; kissing her without her consent. Bella blazes with anger and she slams her fist into his face. Jacob doesn't flinch; he barely feels the punch... but Bella does, and her hand is broken. When Jacob drives her home, Edward is there, ready to start an altercation with Jacob for hurting Bella-- he read Jacob's thoughts. He demands that Jacob wait next time for Bella to ask for him to kiss her, and Jacob vows that one day, she will.Charlie has to separate Edward and Jacob, and he is amused at Jacob's explanation that Bella broke her hand hitting him in the face. Bella's insufferable clumsiness and tendency to be accident-prone makes the explanation completely plausible to Charlie.Edward brings Bella to his house where Carlisle bandages her hand and determines that it is not actually broken, but merely sprained. Emmett is amused at Bella's bravado in hitting Jacob and there is a brief exchange of teasing words between them about her becoming a newborn. Rosalie hears, gets very annoyed, and she curtly leaves the room. Bella follows her, determined to finally get an explanation of why Rosalie hates Bella so much. Rosalie smiles sardonically and even a little sadly as she says she doesn't hate Bella... in fact she envies her, because unlike Rosalie herself or any of the Cullens, Bella has a choice, and Rosalie is the most adamant that she is choosing wrong.Rosalie finally opens her heart to Bella and tells her about herself as a human in the early 20th century. She was engaged to the town's most eligible bachelor, a man named Royce, even though she didn't know him that well. She was young and a romantic, in love with the idea of being in love. But one fateful night she happened across him on a street corner where he was with some of his friends, and all of them were drunk. He tried to come on to her, and she pushed him away, seeing he was drunk. In response Royce grabbed her and brutally raped her, and then beat her within an inch of her life, all while his friends watched, and they left her in the street to die-- and as Rosalie tells Bella, she dearly wanted to have died. But Carlisle happened across her, and changed her in order to save her, though to Rosalie, he wasn't actually helping her at all. The two things in her vampire existence that brought her true happiness and pleasure, were exacting a brutal vengeance on Royce (we see a flashback of her smashing into his apartment wearing a wedding dress and smiling wickedly), and finding and falling in love with Emmett. But even her relationship as Emmett's mate, to her, is incomplete. She is young and beautiful, but she would give it up in a moment to be able to bear Emmett's children. She and Emmett are frozen in time, and she does not fear or worry that she would grow old as a human-- she would do it in a minute if both she and Emmett could become human again and raise their own family. Bella sympathizes with Rosalie but insists that Edward is the one thing she wants more than anything else in life. But Rosalie knows better. She knows that once Bella is a 'newborn,' there is one thing she will want more; one thing she will crave so desperately, she will kill in order to get it... blood.On the streets of Seattle, the newborns are causing more havoc and violence. Riley furiously reins them in, reprimanding them about the need to keep a low profile. He tells them something big is coming on the horizon, and they can't gain control of themselves, then they'll all soon die, including himself. He looks out to the sky, seemingly worried about something.High on a rooftop, watching, is the source of Riley's worry, even if he doesn't know it-- Jane (Dakota Fanning) is watching the scene unfold, along with Felix (Daniel Cudmore), Alec (Cameron Bright) and Demitri (Charlie Bewley). Jane has, in fact, been keeping close tabs on the newborn uprising, and the Volturi are concerned. Felix believes that the amount of attention the newborn uprising has drawn, will cause other vampires to question the effectiveness of the Volturi, and that the four of them should consult Aro. Jane silences Felix with her power to cause intense pain, and says she knows that Aro's decisions are being watched, which is why the four of them were sent here; they must decide themselves. Jane is deep in thought over whether to terminate the newborns immediately, or to first let them do what they were created for-- she knows they were created for a reason.Graduation Day arrives at Forks High School. Jessica's valedictorian speech centers around what kids want to be when they grow up, and this time in all their lives being about making mistakes, changing their minds, and this being what enables them to finally know what their future will be. Bella is thoughtful as she listens; knowing that it applies to her and her desire to join Edward.The senior class is enjoying a lively party at the Cullen home. Bella congratulates Jessica on her speech. Bella is surprised when Jacob shows up at the party. Jacob apologizes for kissing her against her will, and gives her a hand-made bracelet as a graduation present; a bracelet with a small wooden carving of a wolf.Alice comes down the stairs, and stops in her tracks, a look of worry on her face. Both Bella and Jacob know she is seeing another vision. Alice grimly tells them that the Cullens aren't going to need to go to Seattle-- they are coming here.The Cullens convene with Bella, Jacob, Quil and Embry in the den. Carlisle explains to Jacob about the newborn army-- newly changed vampires. Having read Alice's mind, Edward has seen her vision and has determined that the missing teenager, Riley Biers, is among them; possibly even a leader in the army, though he is not their creator... Carlisle realizes that whoever is behind the uprising knows of Alice's power and is exploiting the 'blind spots' in her visions to stay under the radar. The worst part, though, is that Alice saw Riley passing around the red blouse he stole from Bella's room so all the newborns could get her scent. The newborns are coming to Forks and will arrive in four days... and their mission is to kill Bella.Carlisle tells Jacob that this means the Cullens have to face the newborns in what is sure to be a terrible and ugly fight. He knows lives will be lost. Jacob looks at Quil and Embry, who silently nod to him without hesitation. Jacob says that the Quileutes are in; they will fight alongside the Cullens to destroy the newborns. Carlisle says that Jasper has extensive knowledge of newborns, including how to battle and defeat them. He asks Jacob to see if Sam will agree to the wolf-pack meeting with the Cullens so they can all train in these combat methods. Jasper is satisfied that the newborns will have no knowledge of the Quileute wolf-pack, thus giving them and the Cullens an edge, in addition to sufficient numbers. Bella is against Jacob fighting, but he waves her off, reminding her that battling and killing vampires is the wolf-pack's job; the reason they have their powers. He also reminds Bella that she has long desperately wanted to see the Quileute wolf-pack and the Cullens set aside their differences and work together.The next day the Quileutes meet with the Cullens in the woods. They are in wolf-form, still not trusting the Cullens enough to take human form when they will be more vulnerable. Edward, who can read their minds, volunteers to 'translate' for them. Edward says that the Quileutes are asking how newborns differ from other vampires. Carlistle explains that the newborn stage is when a vampire possesses the greatest degree of physical strength and power, because their own human blood still lingers in their bodies. Jasper has the experience they will all need to learn to fight and defeat them.Jasper explains what he knows of a newborn's immense power and how they fight. He admonishes everyone that a newborn will often try to move behind an enemy and get their arms around them, which will allow them to crush their enemy in their grasp instantly. Jasper warns everyone that they must never go for an obvious kill, because a newborn will know to watch for it... and they will turn the tables. Jasper puts his family members through a training session practicing combat tactics and moves to use against the newborns. Jasper himself is the best fighter in the family; the only one who can even match him is Alice, who can not only foresee his actions, but as his mate, she knows him better than anyone else.After the training is done for the day, Bella asks Jasper if there's any way she can contribute to the battle. Jasper answers that her scent will distract the newborns and divert their attention; their hunting drive and bloodthirst will take over and make them vulnerable. Bella is curious about Jasper's knowledge and experience with newborns. Jasper simply smiles and lifts his sweater sleeves, showing battle-scars on his arms. He regales Bella with stories of his human life as a major in the Texas army, fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Near Galveston he met a woman named Maria who was a vampire; looking to change others so they would be able to destroy Union soldiers in battle. Maria was dangerously clever and cautious. She made use of Jasper's power to control the emotions of others, and had him destroy the newborns before they had been a vampire for one year, in order to cover her tracks. But Jasper could feel all the emotions of every newborn he killed and realized that Maria didn't love him, but rather controlled him like a puppet. Finding Alice was what helped him escape and become free. She had seen a vision of him and gone to meet with him. Alice finds her way to them and she shares a passionate kiss with Jasper, and Bella smiles and politely turns her head away.Later that night Bella has a dream of Maria whispering something into Jasper's ear, gently coaxing him into killing someone. She sees this as if she were the one Maria was directing Jasper to kill. Just before Jasper lunges, Bella dreams that Maria suddenly has Victoria's face and voice. Awakening in her room, in Edward's arms, Bella says that the dream has given her the final piece of the puzzle. She realizes that Victoria is the mastermind behind the newborn army, and she is using a second-in-command to do all the dirty work, in order to evade being seen in Alice's visions.As if in answer, we see Riley in Seattle delivering another hapless recruit to Victoria.In the morning, outside the house, Edward is telling Bella that he will taking her to a hidden spot away from the battlefield. With the Quileute wolf pack fighting beside them, the Cullens will be able to handle the newborns, but Bella, as a human, will be too vulnerable. In the chaos of the battle, it would be too much risk of a newborn slipping past the defenders and reaching her. Bella argues that if she and Edward are too far apart, they will both be too worried about each other and both of them will be vulnerable. For once, Edward assents and agrees-- but instead of bringing her to the battlefield, he will go with her to stand guard over her at her hiding place.The two of them meet Jacob and Jasper on a field in a woodland clearing. Jasper has chosen this site for the battle to take place, believing it will provide them with a tactical advantage. Bella's scent must end at this field-- the newborns must be able to track her to it, but not past it. This means she must be carried to the campsite where Edward will be guarding her-- and Edward cannot carry her there because the newborns will still be able to pick up Bella's own scent. But Jacob, as a werewolf, has a scent that vampires find so repellent that it will mask Bella's trail effectively. The newborns won't smell Bella past the battlefield, only the smell of werewolf which they won't be able to stand. Edward doesn't like the idea but he won't question Jasper's knowledge on what will give them every edge they can get in the battle. Too much rides on it.Jacob and Bella talk as he carries her through the woods. Despite the tactical reasons for it, he's sardonic about Edward not being in the battle, but Bella won't try to talk Jacob into not being part of it. Bella knows Jacob would refuse to honor her wishes. Jacob mentions that as Billy's son he had the right to be the alpha wolf of the spirit warriors, but as he originally didn't even want to be one of the wolf-pack at all, he yielded the alpha position to Sam, and Sam feels Jacob will be needed on the battlefield. When Jacob remarks that every choice has its consequences, Bella knows he's referring to her becoming a vampire and asks him to let it rest-- everyone makes their decisions and she's made hers. Jake says he knows that Bella feels something for him; he can sense it about her... and that the Sam-Leah-Emily triangle is proof that she can love more than one person. Bella thinks Jacob is about to try and kiss her again. He just smiles and says he promised not to until she asked. Bella thinks he will have to wait a long time for that, but he thinks she's wrong.Back on the field, Edward is waiting. Jasper has followed Jacob and Bella partway to make sure the plan is working. Jasper tells Edward that he could only smell wolf, meaning Bella's trail has ended on the field as planned. Despite Jasper's assurances that the plan is working, Edward's reaction shows how much effort he has to exert to follow the plan. The thought of Jacob carrying Bella is too harsh for him.Bella is driving home. She finds Alice leaving her house, chatting pleasantly with Charlie-- she's charmed her way into his good graces. Out of Charlie's earshot, Alice tells Bella she's arranged a cover story; that the Cullens are going on a camping trip and Charlie has agreed to Bella having a sleepover with Alice so that Alice will have some company. In fact it is Edward who will be at the Cullen house with her, while Alice goes with the Cullens into the woods to hunt for animal blood so they will be ready for battle. Charlie is going fishing so Bella won't have to worry about him being concerned for her.Inside the house, Charlie confirms that unlike Edward, Alice meets with his approval. Bella asks her father why he never remarried after the divorce with Renee. She's looking to get his viewpoints on marriage to help with her own decision whether to marry Edward, although of course she doesn't tell him that. Charlie says he never really met the right woman for him after the divorce, but he sees value in marriage, pointing to Renee's happy marriage to Phil. He does, however, mention that it tends to work out better, later in life, not earlier as a result of 'not being careful.' This leads to a rather awkward chat about premarital sex (and whether Bella is still a virgin) that leaves both Charlie and Bella rather embarrassed.Bella arrives at the Cullen house for the 'sleepover.' Edward adds a small diamond to Bella's charm bracelet. Going up to his room, Bella sees he has brought a bed in for her to sleep on. Bringing up Edward's desire to marry her as a condition for changing her, Bella says she wants to negotiate her own condition, and gets Edward to promise her anything she desires. But then Bella starts to come on to him and he backs off, afraid of hurting her. Bella begs him to 'try,' because she wants him while she's still human. They start to kiss and make out, but when Bella starts to undress herself, and he sees that she wants to have sex, Edward again backs off. His old school values that Bella had assured Charlie that Edward has, start to assert themselves and he says that back during his days as a living mortal, he would have done things different, including a full courtship, and asking her father for her hand, before proposing. But as he speaks, he takes one knee and presents Bella with an engagement ring that belonged to his mother. He restates his request for Bella to marry him. Bella's heart is finally touched the right way and she says yes.On a secluded rooftop in the darkness over Seattle, another conversation, much more sinister, is taking place. Victoria is gently admonishing Riley not to underestimate the Cullens. Her dead friend (Laurent) is a testament to their powers-- Laurent learned about them and they killed him. Victoria sweetly tells Riley that this is the Cullen family's hunting grounds, and she is afraid of them retaliating against her for trying to slake her own thirst. Riley assures her he'll make the city safe for her, and they begin to kiss. Riley has fallen in love with Victoria and has bought her lies hook, line, and sinker. He clearly has no idea what her true motives are... he's become the Jasper to Victoria's Maria.The next day Bella and Edward are walking through the woods so she can 'mark' a trail leading to the field. Bella's pricked her finger so she can leave a drop of blood at intervals. She finds that Edward has gained the ability to resist the lure of her blood completely, brought about by when he thought Bella had died (back in New Moon). He notes she's not wearing the engagement ring and Bella says she doesn't want to lose it, but Edward knows she also doesn't want Jacob to see it. Bella gives in and says she feels they should wait to tell him. She wants his mind to be focused on the battle. Jacob arrives at that moment-- he'll be carrying Bella the rest of the way. Edward says that Alice has seen a storm coming, and Jacob says he can feel its approach.As Jacob carries Bella, a storm of a different kind also begins moving toward Forks; Riley is leading the newborn army through the woods and across a lake. Clearly he knows the land and how to get where the army needs to go.Jacob arrives with Bella at a small secluded plateau among the mountains, well defensible. Edward has a tent set up. Jacob reveals he will be staying the night at the campsite as well; in the morning, Seth will relieve him so that Edward and Bella can stay apprised of the battle through Seth's telepathic link to the pack. Seth wants in on the battle, but assisting Edward with guard duty over Bella will keep Seth out of trouble.Nighttime comes, the storm blows across the mountains and the temperature drops dangerously low. The tent, the sleeping bag and Bella's own winter clothing all prove inadequate, and she is shivering miserably with cold. Jacob enters the tent, having heard Bella's soft moans of discomfort. Edward realizes that Jacob intends to use his own 109-degree body heat to keep Bella warm, and is dead set against it. Jacob warns Edward that Bella is in danger of getting frostbitten. Edward's distrust for, and rivalry with, Jacob is so intense that it takes every iota of his will to assent to Jacob holding Bella, even for the purpose of keeping her warm.Edward and Jacob finally manage to speak civilly while Bella is asleep. They discuss their respective feelings for Bella. Jacob asks if Edward ever considered that Bella might love him as well, even if she wouldn't admit it to herself, and if Jacob could provide a good life for her. Edward insists he has tried to stop Bella from making him change her, and admits that he understands that Jacob can protect her as well as Edward can, and that Jacob can give Bella a human life. Jacob asks Edward how he coped with the belief that Bella had died and he'd lost her. Edward says he wouldn't wish it on anyone. Bella's greatest wish comes true as Edward finally admits he's glad Jacob is here. Edward and Jacob finally have found some measure of common ground.Morning comes. Seth arrives at the campsite so that Edward will know that Jacob has gone scouting and will return soon. As Seth leaves, Edward and Bella talk about the nighttime experience. Bella knows how hard it was for Edward to let Jacob do what he had to do; he says it's not on his list of favorite evenings. She's amused that Edward has a 'list' of his favorite evenings... at the top of the list, is, naturally, her accepting his proposal. He jokingly calls her Mrs. Cullen and she jokes back that in the 21st century, she has the right to choose whether to change her name.But it is no longer a joking matter when she finds that Jacob has returned and overheard that Bella is planning to marry Edward. She turns toward Edward, furiously angry when she realizes that Edward knew he was standing there. Edward simply says that Jacob deserved to know the truth. Jacob storms off and Bella starts to follow. Edward tries to grab her arm but she sternly warns him off.Bella rushes after Jacob, pleading to him as he curtly says he's off to kill some vampires-- and maybe let one of them kill him in turn. She begs him not to be reckless, and when he won't listen to her reason, she goes into a near-panic and asks him to kiss her. This he does, and they share a long, passionate kiss. Jacob says he has to go to the battlefield but he'll return. Bella realizes Edward knew what was going on-- he says Jacob's thoughts are very loud. Edward understands that Bella loves Jacob, but takes comfort in her assurance that she loves him more.Seth returns to the campsite, taking Jacob's place there so his telepathic link to the pack will keep Edward up to date on the battle.The Cullens stand on the battlefield, waiting as the newborn army rushes forward. On Jasper's signal, the Cullens rush forth into battle, luring the newborns to the rock outcropping behind which the Quileutes await. Led by Jasper, the Cullens and the Quileutes fight together with expert teamwork, allowing them to overwhelm the newborns who, despite greater numbers, fight blindly and recklessly. Victoria is seen observing the battle briefly before rushing off.Bree is the one newborn who is afraid and deeply uncertain about what she's been ordered to do. Seeing the newborns being decimated, she starts to run, only to be cornered by Carlisle and Esme (Elizabeth Reaser). The two look at each other, sensing Bree's terror and uncertainty.Back at the mountain camp, Edward realizes Victoria is near-- he can hear her thoughts. She had noticed Edward was not on the battlefield, and also knew that he wouldn't leave Bella's side, meaning once she found him, she'd find Bella. She's managed to track Edward to the campsite. Edward realizes Victoria is close, and not alone. He urges Seth to hide for ambush.Riley slowly walks out of the trees to confront Edward. Edward tries to reason with Riley, appealing to his logic, explaining Victoria's intent on avenging James and caring for nothing else, and she chose Riley to be her second in the newborn army only because Riley is a Forks native and knows the town and area well. Victoria arrives on the scene and pleads gently to Riley about her love for him and her warnings about Edward's mind tricks.Riley's desire for Victoria ultimately wins out over his logic.and he rushes to attack. Seth intercepts him and tears off his hand. Seeing the odds start to turn against her, Victoria begins to flee. Needing to keep her from escaping again, Edward calls out to her and taunts her about his killing James. She turns and glares as Edward goads her about her need to hurt him because of how he killed her lover and mate. Victoria starts to blaze with furious anger and she leaps at Edward in a rage. They fight and Edward throws her into a tree, which she begins to climb. Getting Bella to one side, Edward pushes the tree down and leaps at Victoria.Seth is distracted by the sound, and Riley kicks him viciously in the snout, knocking him unconscious. He joins the fight between Edward and Victoria, and turns the tide. Seeing Riley and Victoria working together and poised to kill Edward, Bella scrabbles desperately in the snow. She finds a rock with a sharp edge and, taking a page from Taha Aki's third wife, Bella lacerates her arm, letting her blood flow freely. Both vampires quickly smell her blood and are struck with blood frenzy, breaking their concentration and allowing Edward to turn the tide of the battle again. Seth recovers and seizes Riley, dragging him away. He cries desperately to Victoria, but she finally reveals her true nature and abandons him to try and feed on Bella, who stands before her unflinching. Edward intercepts Victoria and grapples with her. Outmaneuvering her, he rips her head off and kills her.Seth growls urgently and Edward notes that Alice needs them all on the battlefield. He burns Victoria's body and they rush to regroup with the Cullens and the Quileutes.Alice has seen the approach of Jane. As Edward, Bella and Seth arrive, Carlise urges the Quileutes to hurry away, because he knows the Volturi will not honor a truce with them.One newborn has survived and is lurking in ambush. Leah leaps on him, but this last newborn is tougher than his brethren. He is about to overpower Leah when Jacob joins the battle, but even then the newborn is able to maneuver around and grab Jacob from behind in a crushing bear hug that shatters the right side of his rib cage. The Quileutes finally finish the newborn off, but Jacob is badly injured, Leah cursing him for risking his life. The pack rushes to his side. Carlisle determines the extent of Jacob's injuries. He tells them that Jacob's wolf powers will allow his body to heal very rapidly, but because Carlisle cannot go with the Quileutes to treat Jacob immediately, this will cause his bones to begin to mend out of proper alignment-- this means when he arrives to treat Jacob, Carlisle must re-break them in order to set them properly. He promises to meet the pack at Billy's home as soon as possible. Quickly Jacob's tribe mates, all in human form now, gently lift him and carry him away.The Volturi arrive and survey the battlefield. Jane is only mildly impressed that the Cullens survived and that she and her underlings were not needed. She then notices Bree cowering behind the Cullens. Carlisle and Esme say they offered Bree asylum in exchange for her surrender, but Jane coldly states the Cullens had no asylum to offer. She torments Bree with terrible pain, interrogating her to learn about her creation. But Bree doesn't know who the leader of the newborn army was-- Riley trusted none of them with the knowledge. Edward slyly suggests that the Volturi knew about Victoria, but Carlisle insists that if they had known, they would have acted early and stopped her themselves. Carlisle and Esme vow to take responsibility for Bree, but Jane says the Volturi don't offer second chances-- the Cullens will be in enough trouble when Caius learns that Bella is still human. Bella quickly says, a date has been set. Jane backs off from Bella but orders Felix to destroy Bree. Knowing that trying to protect Bree will bring the full wrath of the Volturi upon them, the Cullens resignedly step out of Felix's way, leaving the terrified Bree to her fate.Bella arrives at Billy Black's home to hear Jacob screaming in pain, which makes Billy shudder. Carlisle is re-breaking Jacob's ribs so that he can set them properly. Carlisle soon emerges from the house and says that Jacob is out of danger and will start to recover, and he'll return as necessary to help. A grateful Billy shakes Carlisle's hand as he would a friend's. Carlisle tells Bella that Jacob was asking for her.She goes into his room and they talk. Jacob knows that Bella has made her choice and he can no longer fight it. He is still struggling to accept the truth, and desperately wishes he could still change things, but he knows that he has lost the battle for Bella's heart. She asks if she can return to see him again. He says he will need time, but will wait for her-- even after her heart has stopped beating.Bella and Edward are in a meadow talking about the wedding. Edward is amused that Bella is letting Alice plan the whole affair out. He again questions her about her desire, and she explains that as much hardship as she's endured in Edward's world, she's never felt normal as other people define it, and only by making the world of the Cullens into her own world as well, has she felt a true sense of completeness. Remaining human was what she 'should be,' but joining the Cullens was who she truly 'was.' She jokingly tells Edward there is one more dangerous task ahead of them-- they have to tell Charlie about the wedding. Edward puts the engagement ring on her finger and they kiss passionately as the screen fades to black.

title: Bugs and Thugs
synopsis: It begins with Bugs emerging from his hole in a city park, reading the newspaper on his way to the nearest bank, for a withdrawal from his personal depository of carrots. He reads that Rabbit Season Opens Today and comments on his pleasure of living in a more secure urban environment (miraculously avoiding heavy traffic crossing the street while reading the paper).
Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Bugs, Mugsy drives up to the bank, which Rocky invades and robs of an undisclosed sum. Bugs accidentally walks into Rocky and Mugsy's getaway car – mistaking it for a taxi and the giant bags of cash for laundry. Rocky asks Bugs, How much do ya know? Bugs fails to realize that he is in the same vehicle as a robber who is asking him what he knows about the hold-up (Who, me? Oh, I know a lots of things. Two and two is four, Carson City is the capital of Nevada, uh, George Washington was the first President. Rocky responds, This guy knows too much, Mugsy. We'll take him for a ride) When Bugs becomes too gabby during the ride, Rocky points his gun at him and tells him to shut up. Bugs doesn't stop, so Rocky tells him to shut up shuttin' up.
Bugs then asks Mugsy to stop at a nice, clean gas station. Bugs gets out of the car and receives a nickel from the easily fooled Mugsy so he can use the pay telephone to call the police to report Rocky and Mugsy (Hello, Police Department? I've got the bank robbers. We're on Highway 55, headed west. We're driving a '52 Acme - straight 8 - overhead valves - with California license plates!), but gets pulled out of the telephone booth and they escape. The gag is that Bugs still holding on to the telephone – and a policeman with a thick Irish accent is pulled out of the telephone wire onto the road (Operator – we've been disconnected! ooh-hoo...).
Soon, Rocky and Mugsy's car stops in front of a railroad grade crossing protected by a swinging wigwag signal warning of the approach of a train. Rocky tells Bugs to let them know when it's clear; Bugs morphs into Mugsy's profile and voice to tell Rocky OK, Boss! Bugs tells them to go and the oncoming train proceeds to smash into the car with Rocky and Mugsy still inside.
Bugs is soon forced to fix the car at gunpoint by Rocky. Mugsy was told to button his lip and Mugsy literally buttons his lip. Bugs repairs everything except one tire and says that they're stuck. Rocky tells Bugs that he is the only one stuck and forces Bugs at gunpoint to run alongside the car while holding the right front axle (Rocky tells Mugsy to take the scenic route). Soon, they arrive at their cliff house hideout. When Rocky tells Mugsy to take him into the back room and let'im have it, Bugs easily convinces Mugsy that Rocky meant for him to give Bugs the gun (Come, come, you heard what the boss said: 'Let me have it'!). When Mugsy relents, he gets shot by Bugs and stumbles back into the front room and tells Rocky I let'im have it boss, just like you said, and falls unconscious on top of Rocky, who quickly punches him off.
Rocky heads for the back room to really let'im have it, but Bugs yells out a fake alarm scream that the police have arrived and surrounded the house. Bugs hides Rocky and Mugsy in the stove when they fall for Bugs' fake alarm. Bugs pretends to be the policeman with an Irish accent and be himself trying to hide Rocky and Mugsy. While interrogating himself, Bugs denies hiding them in the stove, turning on the gas heat of the stove and throws a lighted match in the oven to prove his innocence. The stove explodes, and the policeman, convinced, leaves. Rocky and Mugsy crawl out of the stove, somewhat scorched. Not five seconds after emerging, the real policemen come and, in an exact match of Bugs' previous ruse, asks where Rocky and Mugsy are. When Bugs is about to throw another lighted match into the oven, Rocky and Mugsy quickly run out of the stove and piteously beg the policeman to arrest them. The next day, Bugs becomes a criminal-catching detective talking on the phone, as a member of Detectives Guild: Local 839 (a pun on the cartoonists' union), styling himself as Bugs Bunny, Private Eyeball – Thugs Thwarted, Arsonists Arrested, Bandits Booked, Forgers Found, Counterfeiters Caught, and Chiselers Chiseled.

title: Altitude
synopsis: In the prologue, the mother of Sara (Jessica Lowndes) is transporting a family of three (two parents and their son) in a small aircraft. The child is extremely nervous and starts hyperventilating. Wondering why he is so afraid, the parents suddenly see an out-of-control aircraft that crashes into them, and everyone plummets to the ground.
Years later, Sara, who has recently received her pilot's license, is planning to fly to a concert with her friends: her boyfriend Bruce Parker (Landon Liboiron), her cousin Cory (Ryan Donowho), her best friend Mel (Julianna Guill) and Mel's boyfriend Sal (Jake Weary). While in the air, Bruce's nerves draw ridicule from the others and Sara invites him to take the controls. They hit some turbulence and Bruce loses control, taking them into a steep climb.
Sara tries to regain control, but a loose bolt has jammed the elevator. Only able to climb, they fly into a storm and lose radio contact. Sara explains that with the elevator jammed, they will keep climbing until they run out of fuel or reach the aircraft's ceiling. They have less than an hour's worth of fuel left; Bruce has a panic attack and is put to sleep with a choke hold by Sal. In an effort to save fuel, they jettison everything overboard. The only way to unjam the tail is to climb outside and manually remove the obstacle. Cory, who has experience as a climber, volunteers. He has climbing gear with him and a rope for to use as an anchor. Sal wraps the rope around himself and after some difficulty, Cory makes it to the tail and removes the errant bolt. Sal then sees a horrifyingly giant tentacle among the clouds and loses control of the rope. Cory slips and Sal is almost pulled out of the aircraft. Panicking, he cuts the rope and Cory falls, only to be caught by the monster tentacle.
When Bruce awakens, he finds he has been tied up and learns Cory is dead, along with a monster outside. Bruce tells Sara that he was in the crash that killed her mother and his parents. Sara tries the radio again and hears a strange noise. Sal recognizes it as the monster that took Cory. Suddenly, the aircraft crashes into the monster's open mouth. Bruce looks at a page of his comic which shows a blond woman being grabbed by tentacles. Immediately, a large tentacle grabs Mel and kills her. Bruce starts flicking through the comic book, as if he has discovered something. Sal threatens to kill Bruce for causing Mel's death and tries to throw him out, but Sara intervenes and in the ensuing confusion, Sal falls out the door and plummets to his death.
Bruce tells Sara he is causing all this; that his mind is recreating the comic book, something that happens when he gets very scared. The creature starts attacking the aircraft, and Sara demands that Bruce prove he is doing it by ending it all. His attempts just make things worse, until Sara kisses him, but is grabbed by the monster. She tells him that if he can do all this, then he can bring his parents back. After a struggle, the monster suddenly disappears and she falls back into the aircraft. As they fly out of the storm, they see another aircraft heading straight for them, carrying Bruce, his parents and Sara's mother. They manage to take control of their aircraft, and don't crash into the other.
In the altered past Sara's mother and Bruce's family have arrived at their destination intact. Sara's mother says Everybody gets one near miss, right?, and Bruce's mom asks, Do you think they made it? to which Sara's mother replies I hope so. The young Sara and Bruce are introduced to one another, holding hands and looking out into the sky.

title: Jennifer's Body
synopsis: Opening scene (depending on the DVD's theatrical or extended versions), shows Needy, a violent inmate, in a correctional facility. She is notorious for being a 'kicker', and is now reflecting during lockdown on past events.
In the small town of Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, the story focuses on two girls who are life-long best friends. One of them is our Anita Needy Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried), a blond-haired, nerdy, substantially unpopular, plain Jane student. The other focus is on Jennifer Check (Megan Fox), a beautiful black-haired girl who is a cheerleader on the school's flag team. Jennifer's pet name for Needy is Monistat, and Vagisil is, in turn, Needy's nickname for Jennifer. An obnoxious Oriental kid chides Needy for being 'lesbi-gay' but she just points out sandbox love is forever.One evening, Jennifer has Needy accompany her to Melody Lane, a local bar, where an indie rock band named Low Shoulder is playing. It seems odd, so unlikely that they would bother to perform at such an insignificant venue, but frontman Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody) explains that it is a service to their fans. Needy overhears him referring to Jennifer, who is fetching them drinks (getting past the age restriction barrier by playing Hello Titty with the bartender off-camera), as the State Fair Butter Queen, the perennial small-town virgin who loves 'showing it off' but remains a teaser. Obviously, he has unresolved issues with girls. During the performance, the bar catches on fire, but Nikolai gazes on with a smirk, and Needy leads a shocked Jennifer to safety through the toilet window, just barely escaping from being killed in the blaze. Outside, they are accosted by the band who of course made it out okay. However, Needy stands by forlornly as the band members lead a dazed Jennifer to their van, before driving off, with Needy watching as the remains of the bar collapses to the ground in a fiery inferno.Needy eventually makes it home where she finds a note from her divorced mother who is working swing shift this evening as well.. Needy calls her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons), and explains about the disaster, and has misgivings about Jennifer's fate, fearing the worst. Those guys could be rapists, and that one guy looked especially evil, almost skull-faced, reminding her of a grim-looking petrified tree she saw as a child. Realizing her worst fears, she unexpectedly bumps into Jennifer in her home: clothing torn, bruised and bleeding, looking like a feral thing risen from the grave. Things get even stranger, as Needy watches Jennifer tear wolfishly into a raw chicken in her fridge and give an unworldly roar at her, before spewing up a black sickly-looking tarry substance all over the floor. Jennifer further terrorizes Needy when she throws her against a wall asking her if she is scared of her. Jennifer then runs out the front door leaving a bewildered and frightened Needy behind.The next day, the tragedy of the bar fire has captured the town, and Needy morosely remembers her childhood friend, who then suddenly just reappears looking every inch the hot teen fox again, and impervious to the sorrows of classmates feeling the tragedy, traipses through the somber halls looking like a junior supermodel on a dreamy Valentine date. Flippantly referring to the burn victims as 'a white trash pig roast', her whole manner is like, get over it! Jennifer even leads the grieving high school football captain into the nearby woods after school, ostensibly to fulfill his deceased friend's suggestion that they'd have made a 'banging' couple. As a menagerie of forest animals gather to watch, she seduces the big guy, literally leading him like a lamb to the slaughter before she bears down on him with that sexy mouth having turned into a demonic gaping maw. Later on in the day, a highly-concerned teacher at the school finds the captain's grisly remains, and the town is rocked by the additional tragedy. Low Shoulder's song 'Through the Trees' becomes the anthem of hope amidst all the gloom and despair, and obviously, they have chart success, donating 3% to the cause of the victims. Needy questions the paltry effort, and how come they are credited with having rescued survivors while she herself knows that is untrue?A month passes by, Jennifer begins to look a little pale and gaunt, enigmatically explaining that 'it is wearing off', she needs sustenance. As Needy watches, Jennifer catches the eye of the school nerd Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), and asks him to meet her at her house. She sarcastically says that she's got the DVD of Aquamarine and that the lead character 'is half-sushi' and that 'she has, like, sex through her blowhole or something', and comments to Needy that the guy is into maggot rock and wears nail polish, so her dick is bigger than his.The next evening, Needy spends time with her boyfriend Chip, while Colin goes to meet Jennifer... only to find her at a still-in-construction house in a deserted neighborhood where she is in an upstairs room which is lit by various candles. It is here that Jennifer suddenly transforms into a snake-eyed humanoid creature which kills Colin and sups on his flesh, as Needy has a shocking vision that causes her to panic as Chip makes love to her.Needy leaves her boyfriend's place, and drives away, only to encounter Jennifer walking like an animal across the road, before jumping onto her car's windshield. Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed, and, true to the spirit of this black comedy, wearing her Evil Dead T-shirt. Jennifer then kisses Needy, which turns into a hot make-out session, which causes Needy to verbaly snap over what is going on. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down....In a flashback sequence, the band Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice, in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, and she pretended to be as pure as the morning rain, hoping that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, and then Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy, that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, and Needy watches as the flesh immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night after she left Needy's house, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire, walking along the road, and waylaid him, killing and devouring him and then hid the body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything that she just told her and on top of that, no one will ever believe such a story no matter how Needy tells it. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands 12 feet down on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library, and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer was by no means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired, though it indeed brought them prosperity. But it has also turned her into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep in tip-top condition. Needy grows upset because of the upcoming Spring Formal, and how it seems that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs her boyfriend Chip about this, but he thinks she should get psychiatric help.Eventually, the Spring Formal comes about, and Needy goes there to meet Chip. Also in attendance is the band Low Shoulder, who have gained a big-time sold-out national tour since that fateful night several months prior. As they take the stage, and Needy does not see Chip anywhere, she bolts from the auditorium. Also, during this time, we see Jennifer ambush Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having sex with Colin, and that was why she was so upset with his death. Jennifer wants to hear that Chip prefers her, but his heart belongs to Needy, and she tries to win him over, and she kisses him ardently. They walk towards an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool, where she flips out into a rage when rejected, throwing Chip into the gunky water.Needy, in her formal pink ball-gown, goes into a headlong barefoot run, desperate to be there before it is too late. She finds Chip in the water, where the demonic Jennifer, in full-blown animalistic mode, has already bitten into him. He is weakened by extensive blood loss. Needy dives into the water to help Chip crawl out while Jennifer closes in for the kill, and Needy sprays her with a can of mace, which makes Jennifer vomit more black fluid at them. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer actually levitates herself out of the pool and confronts them. Jennifer and Needy argue, Jennifer threatens to kill her (she doesn't just kill only boys, she 'goes both ways!') and Chip, with his last energy, stabs Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, impaling her, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy watches helplessly as her beloved Chip, professing his love, I think I already died before you got here, but I woke up when I heard your voice, dies in her arms. The DVD's deleted scenes show how our heroine then went, tattered dress, frog slime-filled hair and all, to confront the band who rushed off the stage upon seeing this vision of vengeance, and she collapsed with sheer exhaustion. Waking up on her bed looking like a wilted flower, she slowly gathers her wits, and then went for her Dad's toolbox and found a boxcutter.Later that evening, Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Jennifer levitates and their fight goes midair. Needy yanks the Best Friends Forever locket from her former friend's neck, and, crashing down onto her, stabs Jennifer through the heart with the boxcutter, killing her. However, the noise is heard by Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel), who finds Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. Murder!Following this, Needy is taken to a mental institution. However, the showdown with Jennifer resulted in her getting scratched and bitten. Supposedly, being bitten by Jennifer also caused some of her demonic powers to be transferred to Needy... as well as her evil personality and attitude. Needy becomes vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows (nobody from her school, not even her own parents, have come to visit Needy at the hospital), she sets a plot in motion to escape.After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell, but that night she manages to use her new demonic powers to levitate herself to an overhead window, where she kicks it out with her near-superhuman strength, before breaking through a nearby chain-link fence and escaping into the night.As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that was used on Jennifer. Needy picks up the knife. Flagging down a passing vehicle, she tells the driver, an old guy intent on scoring with her (ass, gas, or grass, yet another deleted scene), that she's following a band, and the old rat exclaims that it must be one hell of a band, to which she then firmly, coldly, grimly adds that their last performance will be tonight.Wouldn't want to be in their shoes!As the end credits roll, we are treated to amateur video of the band Low Shoulder checking into a fancy hotel after a concert, and candidly doing things in their hotel room (drinking, smoking dope, snorting cocaine, among other debauchery). Eventually, the scene is shown, in cutaways, of the band being savagely murdered by a blurred figure which enters through the front door. We then see police crime scene photos of the dead band members strewn around the hotel room, with the sacrificial knife in the chest of frontman Nikolai Wolf. Just desserts.The final image of the movie shows security camera footage of a pale and evil-looking Needy walking down the hotel corridor, away from the band's room after killing all of them as revenge for what they did to Jennifer. Needy walks past a number of excitedly scurrying female band groupies as she walks out of the hotel.

title: Point of No Return
synopsis: Point of No Return opens to a panoramic view of Washington D.C., fading quikly to the dilapidated, seedy back alleys where homeless people and drug-addicted gangs dwell. One such gang heads through the streets to arrive at a drug store closed for the night. When one of the gang is too slow opening the lock with a key, the gang's leader, Big Stan (Michael Rapaport) smashes the lock off with an axe. A young woman in the gang, Maggie Hayward (Bridget Fonda), is going through drug withdrawal and complains of desperately needing a new fix.Upstairs from the store, the owner (Geoffrey Lewis) and his wife have been awakened by the looting of the store. Despite his wife's pleas as she reports the robbery to the police, the drugstore owner loads a shotgun and prepares to confront the burglars.Johnny, one of the gang members, apparently knows the layout of the store and where the drugs are kept, but cannot find what they are looking for as quickly as Stan wants. Meanwhile, Maggie, in pain from her withdrawal, slowly sags and slumps into a sitting position on the floor, leaning against a display.The drugstore owner confronts the thieves, who reveal their trump card on why they feel he cannot open fire on them-- Johnny is his son. The drugstore owner stares in disbelief at seeing his son among the gang.The police arrive and a shootout erupts. Stan kills both the store owner and Johnny is shot by the police. A police sniper kills Stan and the other gang member. oNe of the gang pistols lands near Magie who picks it up. The police enter the store and one of the officers finds Maggie, still slumped against the display. She is apparently deep in a drug withdrawal-induced psychosis. He removes her headphones, through which she'd been listening to music. Maggie suddenly jams the barrel of the gun under his jaw and pulls the trigger, killing him.Maggie is being hauled out of a holding cell in the police station. Although she is handcuffed, she is resistant and rebellious against the police's attempts. They wrestle her into a chair and the detective in charge vicously backhands her when she refuses to give him her real name. He demands she sign a document, and she asks for and gets a pencil and stabs him through the back of his hand with it. As police drag her away, a man watches from the mezzanine.Maggie is convicted of capital murder for killing the officer, and the judge sentences her to death by lethal injection. Maggie goes berserk and attempts to escape; she tries to break a window. It takes multiple officers to successfully restrain her and carry her away. The same man who was in the station, is again watching from the courtroom seats.As Maggie is strapped to the gurney for her execution, she tearfully begs they wait for her mother to arrive. The needle is inserted into a vein in her arm and drugs injected. Maggie loses control of her bladder as the chemicals take effect and her eyes sag closed. From the observation window, yet again, the same mysterious man is watching.Maggie awakes in a bed, covered to her neck in a sheet and her eyes open and she sees she is in a plain, unfurnished, white-painted room. A peephole in the door opens, and the mysterious man, Bob (Gabriel Byrne), comes in to greet her.Bob shows her pictures of her funeral, including a photograph that shows her father was present. Maggie asks if her mom showed up but the answer is no. To the rest of the world, Maggie is dead, and she is buried at Oakmont Cemetery-- Row 48, Plot 12.Bob makes no attempt to stop Maggie as she runs for the door; he knows it is locked and she can't get out. He tells her he works for a clandestine branch of the U.S. federal government, which is giving her a second chance. Maggie is naturally very suspicious about what Bob and his superiors want from her in exchange from her life. He coldly tells her that for a start, she needs to learn such basics as standing up straight and speaking properly, before she would be instructed in languages and computers-- things that would enable her to do some good for the country. When Maggie asks what would happen if she said no, Bob reminds her, rather matter-of-factly, the location of her grave-- they can easily put her into it for real this time. He gives her an hour to think the offer over.Bob returns to Maggie's room to get her decision. Looking through the peephold, he sees Maggie back in her bed. But when he enters the room, he is hit by a chair to the back. Maggie has dressed in the clothing placed in her room and was hiding behind the door. She jams a knee down onto him and grabs his gun, using him as a hostage to get out of wherever she is. She makes her way toward the main exit; Bob telling all the employees in the compound to return to their desks and make no threatening moves. Several armed guards converge, but Bob tells them to keep their weapons lowered. As they reach the door, Maggie demands that Bob open it, but Bob says it is controlled remotely, and the people with the power to unlock it will not do so, even at the expense of his life.A security rifle is lazing her up for a precision shot through her forehead. Bob calmly asks Maggie for his gun back. Maggie seems about to comply when she suddenly pushes the barrel into her mouth and pulls the trigger. But the gun doesn't fire. Bob grabs the gun and knocks her down, telling her that a smart agent never chambers the first round. Pulling the slide to chamber the round as he says this, Bob shoots her in the thigh to slow her downBob goes to see Maggie later in her room. Her leg has been bandaged and she's been given more time to think, but now Bob wants an answer. At first, Maggie is still resentful and rebellious, but her survival instincts take over and she submits. She wants some things, however, to make her life in the compound easier-- among them, some music from her favorite artist, Nina Simone. Bob agrees to have it brought to her.Maggie begins undergoing the lessons; she is shown how to operate a computer, trained in combat, and the most challenging of her lessons: social manners and etiquette, and posture and grace of movement, and proper use of language and grammar, all under the stern but caring eye of one of the instructors, Amanda (Anne Bancroft).Bob goes to see Maggie at her room. Her reports are coming along excellent, and she is doing well in her lessons. But with all her progress, Maggie is going stir-crazy confined inside the compound, and asks desperately to take just a short walk outside. Bob reveals that he also was once in her place as a recruit, and was going through the same things that she is now. But he can't let her outside. Maggie starts to become rebellious again and during a firearm exercise indiscriminately shoots all the targets for fun; both 'bad guys' and 'innocents.' At a dinner lesson, she becomes frustrated with the use of a knife and fork and finally starts to eat using her hands.Bob and his supervisor, Kaufman (Miguel Ferrer) notice, and are talking about her in Kaufman's office. Bob insists he can bring Maggie back around, reminding Kaufman that a young woman operative is needed 'out in the field.' He says recruits need up to two years to complete their lessons and training, but Kaufman tells Bob that Maggie is only getting six months; after that, if there is no sign of visible improvement, she will be killed.Bob brings Maggie a birthday cake for her birthday. She is very pleased with the cake, but then Bob tells her the ultimatum issued by Kaufman. Bob lightly kisses her cheek as a happy-birthday wish, before leaving her room. Later, Amanda finds Maggie sitting at the foot of the stairs and Maggie pleads to Amanda for help.Under Amanda's tutelage, Maggie quickly masters her lessons. She comes down the stairs, elegantly attired in a black evening dress, black stockings and pumps, her hair styled; her face properly made up... she looks stately and beautiful. Maggie is to be taken to dinner by Bob, just the two of them... outside of the compound. Bob helps her into a light coat and takes her outside where a limousine is waiting.Bob and Maggie are seated at a table in an elegant restaurant. Bob hands Maggie a gift-wrapped package that she opens to display an elegant wooden box. Inside is a high-powered, sleek handgun and a spare clip of ammunition. She listens numbly as Bob discreetly points out two men seated together with a woman at the upper level of the restaurant; one of the men is a V.I.P. and the other man is his bodyguard. Maggie is to kill the VIP; two bullets minimum and go to the last stall of the men's room where a window leads to the courtyard, where a car will be waiting.Maggie kicks her shoes off, slips the spare clip into her her cleavage. She takes the gun andslips up the stairs. She reaches the VIP's table and the bodyguard promptly reacts, but Maggie is faster and quickly puts a bullet in his chest; then takes out the VIP, one bullet in the head and one in the chest. Taking advantage of the sudden chaos, Maggie evades several armed security guards and makes it to the men's room... but she finds that the escape window Bob told her about is bricked up and she cannot get out.Maggie doubles back and makes it into the restaurant's kitchen, pursued by armed men who indiscriminately begin shooting, killing the kitchen staff. They have Maggie pinned down, but her return fire kills several and keeps them at bay. One of the men loads a portable rocket into his rifle. Desperate now, Maggie spots a laundry chute and dives into it just ahead of the rocket and explosion. Escaping from the restaurant, Maggie runs out into the rainy nights and flings her gun into the Tidal Basin.
Back at the compound, Maggie finds Bob waiting for her in her room. Confronted on the bricked-up window, Bob says he knew about it-- it was her 'final test.' Maggie becomes furious and backhands Bob off his chair, grabbing him by his shirt collar. Bob tells her that by passing this final test, Maggie has won her freedom; she will be released from the compound the next day. Calming downMaggie gives Bob a sharp, semi-passionate kiss and says it's the last one she'll give him.Maggie is being prepared for release. Bob tells Kaufman she's ready to be a field operative; Kaufman sternly warns Maggie that he considers her a dangerous loose cannon.Maggie is smartly dressed in a sharp skirt suit, looking to be a professional business woman. Bob explains her cover identity, saying her public name will be Claudia Doran, and she's a Chicago native. She'll be living in Venice, California, working as a computer sales official, therefore having to travel a lot. He gives her all her necessary papers-- passport, birth certificate, and driver's license-- and an envelope with enough money to buy herself a new car. In accordance with her affinity for Nina Simone, Maggie's code name will be Nina. Stepping out of the compound looking like any other working professional, Maggie hails a cab to take her to the airport.Maggie's first task in Venice is to find a place to stay. Walking down a street, she spots a sign outside a small apartment building saying that an apartment is for rent. Approaching the manager, a young man named J.P. (Dermot Mulroney), she inquires about the apartment. He shows her around, having warned her that it would take a lot of work before it was fully ready as it is trashed, but Maggie is pleased with the ocean view from the window and says she'll take the apartment.Maggie's next task is buying herself groceries. She walks through the supermarket, pushing her cart a little aimlessly; clearly not sure how to go about picking up food. Following another woman shopper's choices she loads her cart up with cans of canned ravioli, cantaloupes, a stack of packaged TV dinners, and half a dozen loaves of bread.J.P happens to be in the supermarket as well. When Maggie drops a number of her ravioli cans while preparing to check out, he comes to help her place her groceries on the register counter. They make some small talk as the cashier begins ringing up the items. She boldly invites him to join her for dinner that evening.Over dinner, J.P. tells Maggie a little about himself; in return for managing the building and collecting rent checks for the landlord, he gets half off his own rent. In his spare time, he's working on building up a photography portfolio. Maggie listens in rapt fascination, and suddenly takes a piece of ravioli in her mouth and playfully approaches J.P., inviting him to bite off the half that's sticking out of her mouth. J.P. briefly hesitates but then follows through, and Maggie begins to kiss him. They begin a relationship. He helps her fix up her apartment and takes a number of photographs of her.Four months pass and J.P. finally has noticed that outside of him, Maggie seems to know nobody in the neighborhood and has no friends or family. He realizes he doesn't know a lot about her life. Maggie is agreeable to J.P. asking her some questions... but the ones he asks take her completely off-guard; questions that the cover identity prepared for her don't take into account. J.P. notes her reaction and walks away, a little upset. Maggie goes up to him while he gazes out of her window, and finally tells him a little about her true self; her actual connection to artist Nina Simone-- who was not only her favorite musician, but also her mother's. Maggie explains her love for the simple passion in Nina Simone's music, and how she plays it when she thinks about her mother.Maggie is laying with J.P. in her bed one morning when her phone rings. She answers it, and hears a man on the other end address her as Nina. She's being called to an operative assignment at the Marriott hotel in Century City and is expected at the personnel entrance in an hour. Making up a cover story for J.P. about needing to hurry to El Segundo to salvage the sale of 500 computer video cards, Maggie dresses and heads out.At the Marriott, Maggie goes to the personnel entrance and makes her way to the room service office, where a man in a suit is seeing to the room service staff and two maids, who are tied to chairs and gagged and blindfolded. The man in charge hands Maggie a maid's uniform and tells her to put it on. Once she's dressed, she's told simply to wait.Presently, the phone rings, and one of the operatives takes the call, posing as a member of the room service staff. He politely takes the service order and prints up a receipt, telling the caller that the order will take 15 minutes to arrive. THe other operatives quickly set to work preparing glasses of orange juice, a bowl of cereal, several cups and kettles for coffee and tea. The lead operative carefully places a circular disc-shaped object into the base of the coffee pot. Maggie is to bring the room service tray to its destination and then return.Maggie delivers the room service tray, looking a little nervous as a man in a suit outside the doorway quickly frisks her to make sure she's unarmed. She brings the tray inside the suite where a number of men in suits make small talk. One of the security agents quickly checks the items on the tray, and then signs the receipt for Maggie.Maggie returns to the room service office, where the operatives are listening and recording all sounds from the suite through an eavesdropping device concealed in the room service tray. She gives the receipt booklet to the lead operative and asks what she needs to do now. Shrugging and looking as though the answer should be obvious, he tells Maggie that she is free to return home.Changing back into her skirt suit and once again looking like a working professional, Maggie leaves the hotel and smiles as she heads back to her car. As she prepares to start her car up-- a major, fiery explosion suddenly tears through the top floor of the hotel. Maggie knows that she delivered the tray that not only concealed a listening device, but also must have concealed a high-power explosive.Bob is waiting for her outside her building. Everyone at headquarters, including Kaufman, is pleased at her performance. Headquarters knows she's met a man and is romantically involved with him... Bob now needs to meet J.P. himself. Over Maggie's protests, he tells her that she needs to invite him to her home for dinner.Bob arrives at Maggie's house for the dinner with Maggie and J.P., posing as Maggie's uncle. During the meal, Bob and J.P. do most of the talking; Bob relaying carefully prepared answers about himself. J.P. asks Bob a little about Maggie, which infuriates her as she had managed to talk J.P. into neither of them talking a lot about their respective backgrounds. Maggie angrily lashes out at J.P. and carelessly lets slip a detail about having come from the ghettos of Kansas City-- despite her cover identity being about having come from Chicago. Bob defuses the situation by telling a gentle story about how Maggie was born in Kansas City. Maggie gives a small smile as she listens to Bob. Bob tells J.P. that he is in the travel business, and is giving both of them a present-- tickets to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras. Maggie suspects that this is a cover to get her to New Orleans where she will have a field assignment.Maggie has some time to enjoy the festival with J.P., but as they head in search of a suitable bistro to get a meal, they are accosted by two men intent on robbing them. J.P. hands over some cash, but the men are not satisfied with anything less than everything they are carrying. Maggie quickly lashes out, putting her training to use, subduing both assailants... and then having to explain to J.P., although he is impressed at how she handled herself. She calls room service for a meal but the happiness is cut short when the call for Nina arrives. The caller tells her that the bathroom cabinet has a hidden compartment.Maggie manages to excuse herself to take a bath, filling the tub as cover so she can search the cabinet. She finds a headset and walkie-talkie and sets them up. Her caller tells her to look in the drawers under the sink, and she finds a high-power rifle with a sophisticated silencer barrel and scope, assembling them quickly and expertly. She's then directed to open her window, but there's no handle. She uses the bath at to muffle the sound of her breaking the glass. Her caller directs her to aim at an approaching limousine, but he has to wait for further instructions while she is stalling for time with J.P., who has decided he wants to propose to her. Maggie tries to stifle her tears. Room service arrives which buys Maggie a minute or two as J.P. takes the order and signs the receipt. But her caller still hasn't been identified who Maggie's target is.As J.P. returns to trying to get Maggie to answer him, she is finally told that her target is a woman in white. J.P. and Maggie's caller are both unknowingly vying for her attention takes away from her focus and she struggles desperately for composure. Finally she makes her shot just before J.P. finally opens the door and confronts Maggie. He sees she's still in her shirt and panties, even though the tub is full, and he notices the broken window. Tearfully, her voice a whisper, Maggie finally confesses that long ago, she did something very bad, and although she came through it, she must spend the rest of her life paying a bitter price. J.P. is moved to compassion and comforts her, but when she begs him to understand that she has her reasons for being secretive, he says he'll take it 'for now.' She's hidden the rifle and radio in the bathtub.Maggie confronts Bob at the operation HQ. She tells him she's had enough and wants out, but Bob sternly rebuffs her, warning her that 'out' doesn't exist in their field. She tries to appeal to his sense of humanity, insisting that she is no longer the same cold-hearted murderer who he saved from execution.Bob hands her a dossier on a wealthy man named Fahd Bahktiar (Richard Romanus), saying that the job needed is specifically what she was trained for; only a woman operative could hope to pull it off. The job entails impersonating his girlfriend to get onto his estate, then killing him and destroying his computer containing secret data on sensitive nuclear information he's peddling to the Middle East... after she downloads it to discs to bring back.Maggie goes to see Amanda and asks whether Amanda believes she would be capable of leaving the agency. Amanda finally tells Maggie that she doesn't know. Maggie thanks her and leaves... dropping the dossier in a trash bin on her way out.Back at Maggie's home, she is taking out trash and finds Bob outside. He's recovered the dossier and hands it back to her. Relenting on his initial position, he quietly tells her that if she completes the job, he'll try to help her in return.Maggie spends time with her assistant, Beth (Lorraine Toussaint), researching Fahd's girlfriend, Angela (Olivia d'Abo), studying acquired tapes of a birthday party Fahd threw for her, so Maggie can properly impersonate her. As they are doing their work, J.P. arrives home. His reception of Beth is completely cynical and sarcastic; he's figured out by now that Bob is not Maggie's uncle and that the black Beth is not a relative.Maggie and Beth pose as stylists that are due to make up Angela's hair and nails. On the terrace, they discreetly try to offer her some jasmine tea which has been drugged, but Angela demurs, saying she doesn't drink tea. Forced to improvise, Maggie waits until Angela puts her hands in Beth's, then Beth grips her hands to hold them while Maggie covers Angela's mouth and injects her with a knockout drug. Unfortunately, before Angela succumbs to the drug, her muffled cries alert her bodyguards and a gunfight breaks out. The two bodyguards are killed, but Beth is hit and wounded. She calls Kaufman to report in, and Maggie is horrified to learn from Beth that Kaufman is calling in a cleaner.The Cleaner, Victor (Harvey Keitel) arrives. He puts the two guards, along with a security agent he killed getting into the building, into the hot tub and puts Angela inside as well even though she's unconscious, and begins pouring strong acid into the tubs as part of 'clean-up.' Beth, who knows that there were supposed to be no side casualties in the job, is horrified, but Victor silences Beth with a bullet to her heart. Maggie, getting scared, knows that she can't afford any more screw-ups in finishing the job. She makes herself up as Angela and Victor drives her to Fahd's.Back at HQ, Kaufman is telling Bob that a cleaner was brought in to make sure the problems that have already arisen in the operation, won't cause a backlash that implicates them. This also includes orders for Victor that after Maggie finishes the job, she must also be killed.Maggie, disguised as Angela, gains entrance to Fahd's house, She goes to the bathroom where he is taking a bath, and pulls her gun, ordering him to go to his computer and bring up his nuclear program.Bob is seen hurrying out of the HQ building and into his car.Maggie herds Fahd into his study and makes him access his computer. When the monitor shows a system error, Maggie suspects him of stalling and pushes him aside, entering a command to write to a floppy disk. But the disk drive is encrypted and requires a password. Maggie threatens Fahd by telling him to imagine what a bullet in the stomach would feel like, in order to get the password from him. Putting a disk into the drive, she begins copying all the data.One of Fahd's security agents tells Victor that he cannot stay parked where he is and has to move his car. Victor pretends to cooperate, but throws the car into reverse so that the agent is scooped up onto the trunk and tossed over a low fence to tumble down the steep hill that Fahd's estate is located atop.Maggie finishes copying the data and inserts a device into the computer's disk drive that fries all of the computer's circuits and the hard drive. She orders Fahd on the ground, which Fahd knows means she intends to kill him. Maggie's hand shakes and Fahd notices that she is struggling to carry out her orders. Fahd's survival instincts kick in and he leaps up, tackling Maggie to the ground and wrestling for control of her gun while he yells for his chief bodyguard.Maggie manages to hit Fahd in the head and then fights her way past several guards to leap into Victor's waiting car. More guards converge, shooting, as the main gate closes to cut off exit. But Victor drives off the main path to bust through a side fence, making it onto a road and escaping.Maggie says she's through and has had enough... but as Victor turns to look at her, she realizes that Victor is planning to kill her As Victor reaches for his gun, Maggie bashes him with her purse and grabs the hand brake for the car, careening it out of control and leaving it half perched on a bend in the road over a steep incline. Victor hits Maggie in her face, knocking her out of the car. He leaps down after her and they fight. Maggie crawls into a shallow space between the car and the ground, and Victor tries to get at her with a knife. When Victor braces himself by grabbing onto the underside of the car, Maggie lashes out with her boot and the car tips further over the edge of the road, pinning Victor underneath it and partially crushing him. Maggie tries to crawl out sideways from the shallow space protecting her, but Victor manages to grab her by her throat. They struggle until the car finally slides over the edge of the road, breaking Victor's grip and crushing him completely as it slides all the way down the incline, taking him with it.Bob arrives on the scene as a fire crew is on the scene. They show him where Victor's car is, but there's no sign of Maggie.Maggie has managed to make it back home and takes a shower. She goes to her bed, finding J.P. seemingly asleep, but she can tell by his breathing that he's awake. J.P. sits up and is horrified on seeing that Maggie is bruised and banged up. He kisses her lightly and gives her a hug.Bob 
arrives at Maggie's home and is let in by J.P., whose reaction at the sight of Bob shows that he understands more about his true connection to Maggie than Bob would care for. J.P. shows Bob that Maggie has left home and taken none of her personal belongings with her, not even her purse-- nothing but the clothes on her back... and J.P. understands some of the reasons why. J.P. asks Bob to just let Maggie go. When Bob says he can't, J.P. hands him the disk Maggie was supposed to get for him-- she'd left it with J.P. to give to Bob. Bob picks up one of Maggie's Nina Simone records and asks if he can take it with him.As Bob starts to drive off, Maggie is seen watching from further down a side street. Shivering briefly, she starts to walk down the street. As she walks, Bob suddenly pulls back and looks intently at her. He calls Kaufman on his mobile phone. He says there was a bad car wreck last night, and Victor is dead, but all the information they needed was salvaged. Bob seems to struggle for a long moment, but finally tells Kaufman that Maggie is dead as well.Maggie half turns and notices Bob's car driving off. She knows that he spotted her and recognized her and has left her alone.

title: Megan Is Missing
synopsis: Megan is Missing begins with a simple video caption on black screen declaring that the movie is based on actual events from actual missing-children cases. (It should be noted, however, that the movie itself and all scenes there in, are fictitious and performed by the actors.)Switch to Megan Stewart (Rachel Quinn) and Amy Herman (Amber Perkins) together in Amy's bedroom, doing an ad-lib performance together for Amy's new video camera. Megan and Amy are the best of friends, almost like sisters. The screen freezes and a caption appears saying that Megan disappeared without a trace on January 14, 2007, and that Amy followed suit three weeks later. A second caption claims that the film was assembled using cell phone logs, computer files, home videos and public news reports.A title screen appears, and then a caption giving the date as January 2, 2007.Amy and Megan are together in a coffee shop frequented by members of their high school. As Megan's laptop captures video footage, Megan and Amy commiserate about having to return to school the day after New Year's, though it quickly switches to Amy's virginity, something she is sensitive about. The scene shows that Megan is a social butterfly and popular in her class, while Amy is a quiet, semi-timid and decidedly unpopular girl with virtually no friends outside of Megan.Caption: January 4, 2007:Megan is in her bedroom, and a caption lists her name, her birthdate (August 12, 1992) and her age during the time of the video recording (14 years old). Megan is at her laptop in her room having a video conference with her friend Angie (Carolina Sabate), discussing a supply of drugs Angie had just gotten from another student named Tercel. Both Megan and Angie have bought drugs from this Tercel, paying for them with sexual favors. Angie mentions that she and her boyfriend, Gideon (Trigve Hagen), who is with her at the moment, are attending a party later that evening.The conversation is interrupted by Megan's mother, Joyce Stewart (April Stewart), who is outraged that her TV program didn't record because Megan unplugged the VCR to use her game box and forgot the plug it back in when she was finished. Joyce is shown to be a loud, shrewish woman who treats Megan badly and makes the girl feel unloved, even screaming that Megan should go live with her father and get out of Joyce's life. So incensed is Joyce at missing her TV show that she takes a hammer and smashes Megan's game box while Angie and Gideon laugh in disbelief at Joyce's outrageous antics.Megan gets another video call and switches to it. Amy is inviting her to hang out together at the local mall, or any other places Megan might prefer. Unfortunately, Megan has to stay home tonight and help her mother with some things.Switching back to Angie and Gideon, Megan is reluctantly enticed to come over to their house and play with them in return for a small packet of the drugs.Caption: January 5, 2007:Amy is getting ready for school. A caption lists her name, her date of birth (January 10, 1993), and her date at the time of the recording (13 years old).Amy's parents, Bill and Louise Herman (John K. Frazier, Tammy Klein) comes into her room to talk about the planned party they're intending to throw for Amy's 14th birthday, only a week away. Bill was looking to host it at a particular place that Amy liked, but she says she's starting to feel too old for it. The scene quickly reveals that Amy's parents are very loving and dote on her, in direct contrast to Megan's parents, who are divorced and provide her with none of the parental love and support she still very much needs. After they leave, Amy looks at her face in her mirror again and sighs. Bill had called her 'Princess' in a loving way, but Amy feels that to the rest of the kids in the neighborhood, she's more like 'Princess Pudgy.'Later that day, Megan receives a cell phonecall from an acquaintance named Ben (Rudy Galvan) while hanging out at the coffee shop with her friends Lexie (Jael Elizabeth Steinmeyer) and Kathy (Kara Wang). Ben is hosting a party that weekend and is calling to invite the three along. Both alcohol and drugs will be freely available. Lexie, Kathy and Ben are all stunned when Megan insists on bringing Amy with her to the party; Lexie and Kathy going so far as to politely excuse themselves. Ben is furious at the idea of Amy attending the party, but Megan doesn't back down. The scene shows that Megan is sufficiently 'in demand' in the student party scene that she has the influence to open doors that would otherwise be closed to Amy.By now, the friendship between Megan and Amy is also shown to be one that fulfills both of their strongest needs: Megan gives Amy access to peer social events that she would otherwise be shut out of, while Amy gives Megan a confidante that soothes and comforts her in light of the horrible way she's treated by her mother.Caption: January 6, 2007:Ben's party. Outside of Ben and Gideon, the party is almost all girls. Each has to pay $10 for entry or else provide a sexual favorThe teens dance to glaringly loud rock music, drink, smoke pot and do cocaine. Amy listens to the music and holds a beer bottle in her hands but drinks sparingly and doesn't dance, feeling awkward about it. Some of the girls get tipsy enough to dance close together, and Ben spends time making his moves on whoever will receive them. Megan in particular doesn't care for Ben's advances. Kathy, on the other hand, enjoys feeling 'wasted.' Even Amy starts to get tipsy from drinking, but pushes Gideon away when he starts to grope her while one of Ben's friends films it. Gideon slaps Amy hard across her face for her trouble. Humiliated and crying, Amy goes looking for Megan, only to find her on her knees in front of Ben, performing fellatio on him. Megan is severely embarrassed at being seen by Amy.Near the end of the party, Amy slumps against a stairway banister, not feeling well after drinking most of the night. At the foot of the stairs, Lexie is coaxed into snorting a little coke and slowly french-kissing another girl while Ben films it. Amy suddenly throws up on the two girls, much to Lexie's total outrage and disgust, but to the delight of the other boys who hoot up about Amy being drunk.Late that night, Megan and Amy comfort each other via video conference. Megan admits that she doesn't particularly care for most of the other students, despite her popularity among them, and Amy is her only real friend. She amuses Amy with a story of how she did fellatio at age ten on a 17-year-old camp counselor; a conversation that's rudely interrupted by Joyce, who demands that Megan turn her computer off and go to sleep. Megan, embarrassed, tells Amy she desperately wants to get away from her mother and they talk briefly about running away together to Texas before ending the call to go to sleep.Caption: January 10, 2007; Amy's 14th birthday:The first scene in the movie, Amy and Megan doing an ad-lib for Amy's new video camera (shown to be a birthday present). More of the scene is shown as they ad-lib a mock interview of their respective life stories. Megan goes first, and her bubbly demeanor suddenly turns quiet and sad as she talks about her family. Her voice is sarcastic as she 'claims' her mother loves her, and she doesn't know where her father lives or what he does for a living... and her stepfather, Paul, is in prison for raping Amy repeatedly over a two-year period starting when she was nine. Megan says that Joyce was so frightened of losing Paul that she blames Megan for his going to prison and this is likely one reason for Joyce's abominable treatment of her. Megan finishes by saying that boys like her and she provides them any favors they want, but insists that they pretend to love her-- even though she knows it's fake and in her opinion, pathetic. Amy hugs Megan comfortingly, and Megan is seen to take real solace in it.Caption: January 13, 2007:Megan and Lexie are video chatting. Lexie tells Megan about a young man named Josh that she's met online. Josh is a skateboarder and attends Tolland high school, and he took notice of Lexie's internet profile because she listed skateboarding as an interest, even though she doesn't know how to ride a skateboard (guys dig it when girls are into skateboarding, Lexie tells Megan). Lexie tells Megan that Josh's online handle is 'skaterdude.' Megan does a search on the handle and a photo of Josh is shown, with a caption saying that Megan downloaded the photo and it was later found on her computer. Lexie mentions that Josh's little brother accidentally broke his laptop's webcam, and tells Megan that Josh met George Clooney at a mall and talked to him once. She innocently suggests that Megan instant-message Josh some time, and Megan says that maybe she will later.Amy is shown making a video diary entry. She points her video camera all around her room, showing her stuffed animals, and says that her favorite teddy bear is named Billy, but she doesn'st have him anymore. She points the cam at a picture of Amy and Megan together. She takes her camera all around her house, describing some of it in the diary entry, saying she lives in Sherman Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles. She 'introduces' her mother (who slyly suggests that Amy SHOULD be doing her homework while Louise is making dinner) and the family cat (who Amy says is older than her in real years, which makes him over 100 in 'cat years') on the diary entry, and says that her father works long hours and isn't at home as much as he'd like, but always makes sure to come home for important events.Megan makes contact with Josh (Dean Waite) online. He tells her a little about his skateboarding and that the teachers at his school 'suck.' Megan says they also suck at her school, which she names as Alton; Josh recognizes the name and says that he doesn't live far away. He tells her he practices boarding at a ravine behind a diner that Amy knows about and goes to often. Amy is briefly disturbed when Josh asks her to tilt her webcam down a little (she knows exactly why he's asking), but Josh apologizes and backs down, whereupon Megan obliges him, and he compliments her on her blouse. Megan mentions Josh's broken cam, and he says his dog chomped on it-- Lexie had told Megan that Josh's little brother broke it. Josh quickly says that both his brother and his dog did their share in breaking the cam. He is attending the party that Lexie had invited Megan to, and asks Megan if she's coming-- since Megan has seen his photo maybe they can hook up. Megan is unsure if she wants to go. There is some sardonic banter between the two of them before they finally sign off. After the call is ended, Megan suddenly rushes to her dresser and grabs a strappy black top and a denim skirt.That evening Megan is walking to Tracy's house for the party and calls Amy on her laptop. She tells Amy that she decided at the very last minute to go the party after talking to a boy she met online.Amy makes another video diary entry. She's looking through a teen magazine to find a nice prom dress in case a boy asks her to his when she's a senior in high school. Then she figures no boy is ever going to ask her to a prom and drops the F-bomb at her video camera before ending the diary entry.Caption: January 14, 2007:Amy calls Megan at 8 AM to see how the meeting with Josh went at the party. Megan says that Josh was a no-show; she waited four hours for him. She tells Amy Josh's name and calls him a jerk. Amy invites Megan to go to a movie with her after she's feeling more awake, and they end the call.Josh contacts Megan online. Megan confronts Josh at his no-show at the party, but Josh insists he was there, and he proves it by accurately describing Megan's outfit, including the butterfly clip she wore in her hair. When Megan asks why he didn't come up to her, he gets embarrassed and says he kind of 'wimped out' when he saw how popular she was with the other teenagers. Megan finds this flattering and forgives Josh. She tells him that she's going to see a new Matt Damon movie with her best friend and drops a hint that Josh can come along. He gets a little shy but then bites at the offered bone and offers to get her some ice cream after the movie (he's a little shy about meeting Megan's friend).Megan steps out of the house and calls Amy on her cell phone, and tells her why Josh didn't come up to her at the party. She finds him very sensitive and likes that about him. She tells him he's going to web her around 7:30 and offers to let Amy come with her.Josh makes web contact with Megan after the movie, and Megan introduces Amy to Josh. The three talk briefly and Josh sends another picture of himself showing that he surfs as well as skateboards-- he says the current time of year is perfect for surfing because of water currents from Mexico (showing he knows a lot about the sport). Amy heads home and Megan and Josh agree to meet behind the diner. After they end the call, Megan quickly grabs up her purse, and the camera continues to show her empty room for half a minute after she walks out.Caption: January 15, 2007:Megan wasn't present at school, and Amy hasn't been able to reach her to find out how the date with Josh went. She becomes worried enough that she contacts Kathy and Lexie, both of whom are cold and curt in their reception of her, telling her only that they haven't talked to Megan either before quickly hanging up on Amy.Amy webs Josh online to find out about Megan, and he gets a little concerned as he tells her that he was hoping to ask her the same thing; they were supposed to get together last night, but Megan never showed. He promises to web her if he hears from her.Caption: January 17, 2007:News anchor Callie Daniels (Lauren Leah Mitchell) reports on Megan's disappearance. The news broadcast is perfectly put together to grab at the heartstrings, including a portrayal of Megan's mother as frightened for Megan's welfare and praying for her safe return, and a reporter asking Kathy and Lexie about Megan, who they say simply didn't show for school all of a sudden. The news report goes into elaborate detail about Megan's life in her community and school, complete with the school principal, and Kathy and Lexie, giving all the magic words about Megan: popular, beautiful, role model, honor student, active in the community, everyone loves her. After finishing up the section on Megan, Callie Daniels gives a very short, brief summary about another missing child: a 13-year-old boy named Tercel Jackson, before going to commercial.Caption: January 18, 2007:Amy makes a late-night video diary entry where she talks about her worry over Megan, and that she doesn't believe that Megan ran away, as the news reporters speculate was possible. She says she can feel in her heart that Megan is still alive, and Amy is sleeping with her cell phone next to her pillow in the belief that Megan will call her at any time.Caption: January 19, 2007:News reporter Yvette Bartosik (the name of her character as well as the actress' real name) is reporting with a 'stunning update' on Megan's disappearance: Security camera footage from the diner reveals footage of Megan being seized. The footage shows Megan walking behind the diner when a man came up to her, grabbed her wrist and led her away. The footage is too grainy to show Josh's face or whether Megan resisted or tried to call for help.The security camera footage is shown three times in slow-motion, with captions saying it is being shown first in original size, then enlarged 200%, and finally 500%. It is still impossible to tell if Megan was frightened at the moment she was grabbed, or what Josh looks like; although it can be seen that his hair is shorter, darker, and styled differently than in the picture that Lexie had sent Megan.Caption: January 20, 2007:Amy and Josh are talking online. Amy seems uncomfortable with Josh calling her 'cute girl,' even though he tries to assure her that he finds her attractive. She asks him plainly if he was the person in the security camera footage, and he says (amused) that that was 'some old dude.' Reading Amy's worry, Josh asks about Amy's friendship with Megan and learns how close they really are. Josh suddenly turns callous when he says he's surprised that Amy is the kind of girl that Megan would hang with; when she accepted his calling her attractive, he says, it meant she was stupid. Amy confronts Josh on her belief that he knows where Megan is, but he denies it. Josh's tone reveals his true colors as he rails on about how everyone perceives Amy; including, he claims, Megan. She again demands to know what he did with her, and he says, 'nothing she didn't do with 100 guys before.'Caption: January 29, 2007:A news report gives breaking new details in Megan's disappearance: Amy has gone to the police and told how Megan met a man named Josh online. The news report gives Josh's name, as well as his online handle of skaterdude. Amy is shown leaving the local station surrounded by her parents and police officers who fiercely protect her from the onslaught of media questions.Caption: January 31, 2007:Amy is making a video diary entry showing some of the places that she and Megan freuqnted together. As she passes the diner, Lexie and Kathy see her and walk up to confront her. Lexie becomes particularly emotional as she lambastes Amy over Megan's disappearance. Unable to deal with her guilt over having introduced Megan to Josh-- now the prime suspect in her disappearance-- Lexie becomes hysterical and starts to scream at Amy that she loved Megan as well and tries to pin Megan's disappearance on Amy.Amy's video diary continues. She walks past a bridge that she and Megan often visited.She sets her laptop on the ground under the bridge and squats down in front of it, reminiscing about the adventures she and Megan shared. She turns to a niche in one of the bridge's supports and pulls out her favorite teddy bear, Billy, saying that she hid him here after Louise wanted Amy to get rid of Billy because he was growing old and ragged.As she holds the teddy bear, a silhouette is seen appearing several yards behind Amy, on the other side of some foliage. The silhouette stays put and appears to eavesdrop as Amy talks about the whole experience making her not want to grow up and that she'd just rather stay there under the bridge holding Billy.Caption: February 1, 2007:Amy is on the internet when Josh makes contact to confront her on going to the police. He warns her that free internet screen names can easily be set up and discarded anywhere, at any time, meaning the police can't find him. He demands that Amy shut her mouth about him, threatening that he might have to 'visit' either her or her mother if she doesn't leave him be. Amy stares into her webcam, frightened, for half a minute before shutting her webcam off.Caption: February 2, 2007:A news report gives a detailed live-action re-enactment of the security camera footage showing Megan's abduction. The re-enactment has been filmed at the exact spot of her abduction and features commentary from the director and the actors playing Megan and Josh, speaking about the importance of spreading awareness on child safety. The actor playing Josh speaks about how hard it is playing the role of such a despicable internet child predator. The actress playing Megan talks about how the internet isn't as safe as people think, even when you're in your own home. The actual re-enactment footage ends with the Megan actress starting to scream for help as the Josh actor forces her into a white SUV and drives off with her.A video caption says that on March 4, 2007, two photographs of a young girl later identified as Megan, were found posted on a fetish website's forums. The website owner contacted the FBI because of the graphic, disturbing nature of the photos showing what was clearly an underage girl. A second caption says that the photos have never been released to the public before.The photos show a wooden table; the table's top is a pillory with openings to trap a person's neck and wrists. Megan is locked inside the device; her eyes wide and wild, her hair matted and disheveled. Built into the table-top pillory near the neck opening are metal hook braces that hold Megan's mouth wide open. A rubber band is slung over her head, ending in another metal hook that is lodged in her hostrils, pulling the base of her nose opward. Megan's fingers, hands, and knees are bloody, showing she's been tortured and abused, both physically and sexually.Caption: February 4, 2007:Amy makes another video diary entry under the bridge. She talks about how volunteers for the search for Megan are dwindling and people are losing hope she is still alive. Amy admits she isn't sure herself, anymore, if Megan is still alive. Needing solace, she turns to the niche to reach for Billy-- and a man's hand is seen reaching into the video camera view to seize her.News anchor Callie Daniels gives an update on Megan's disapparance, reporting that Amy has vanished after having gone to the police with information on Josh. Police are concerned on the double disappearance but continue to look into 'all possibilities,' including that the two girls might have run away together.Caption: February 6, 2007:News reporter Yvette Bartosik reports on a pink ribbon campaign organized in the neighborhood where Megan and Amy live, in the hopes of the two girls being returned safely home. Even Lexie and Kathy are taking part in the campaign, although they carefully mention only that they'd like to see Megan return home safely. Amy's parents are shown thanking the volunteers for their search and praying for Amy's return.A caption says that the following scene is a short piece of news footage not previously broadcast: Search workers are looking in trees just off a road. A worker tells the chief he's found something. The chief notices the reporter and sends another worker to make the reporter leave the scene.Another caption says that on March 12, 2007, Amy's video camera was found in a trash bin in the Angeles National Forest. Photographs show the inside of the trash bin and then a zoom-in photo shows the camera visible among some trash, and finally a police detective holding the camera, placed in a plastic evidence bag, as he talks with search workers.Another caption announces footage of a man believed to be 'Josh' as found on the camera. It shows the silhouette coming into view well behind Amy in her video diary entry from January 31. The view zooms in on the silhouette but cannot reveal any positive details about 'Josh.'A caption says that the following scenes are the final 22 minutes of footage found on Amy's video camera after it was discovered; the footage is unedited and unaltered.Amy is shown as 'Josh's' captive, stripped to her bra and panties, chained at the neck to a wall in a small, filthy cell that looks disturbingly like it was built for that very purpose. It is very dark, showing it to be underground or a sub-basement. The camera pans past a closed polypropylene-plastic barrel as 'Josh' goes to check on Amy. The terrified girl tearfully begs and pleads for mercy, for 'Josh' to let her go. He coldly tells her that Megan is here, but Amy can only see her when he says so. He tells her that Josh isn't his real name, and he douses her with a bucketful of dirty water.More graphic scenes are shown of Amy as 'Josh's' captive. She is savagely and unmercifully tortured, raped and sodomized, passing out from the pain of it, and forced to completely debase and humiliate herself by kneeling on the floor and putting her hands behind her back, eating the food he's placed in front of her as a dog would-- she complies when 'Josh' dangles her teddy bear, Billy, in front of her. He gives it to her finally, and she huddles against the corner of her cell, cuddling the bear and crying.Finally 'Josh' takes her out of her cell, talking sweetly to her about whether she'd like to go home. He tells her that he needs to put her in the barrel so she can't see where he lives. But when 'Josh' opens the barrel, Amy is horrified to find that it contains Megan's body. She screams in horror as 'Josh' forcefully stuffs her into the barrel and re-seals it.A heartbreaking twelve-minute finale ensues revealing Amy's appalling fate: 'Josh' has taken her out into the woods and digs a hole to bury her alive. 'Josh' wordlessly digs as an increasingly desperate Amy professes to love him with all her heart and will submit herself completely to him if he lets her live. But finally the hole is completely dug and 'Josh' tips the barrel, rolling it to the bottom of the hole. Amy's soft and tearful pleas give way to hysterical shrieks for someone, anyone, to come and help her. 'Josh' says nothing as he buries her alive in the makeshift grave, finally picking up the flashlight and walking toward the break in the treeline, leaving Amy to die.Megan and Amy are shown together on side-by-side missing-child posters. Megan's poster says that anyone having or wanting information should to to the website 'findmegan.com' (which leads to the website for the movie).The end credits ensue among a video diary entry where Megan and Amy wistfully talk about what their future will be like when they grow up. At the end of the entry, Amy asks Megan if she thinks Amy will meet a man when they're grown up. Megan assures Amy that she will one day... and that they'll both just know when the right guy comes along.

title: Stone
synopsis: Young mother Madylyn Mabry puts her daughter to bed while her husband Jack watches a ball game on television. A bee buzzes around the window as she stays with her girl. After the child is asleep, she goes downstairs and announces she's leaving, saying You keep my soul in a dungeon. He takes a moment to disconnect from the game, then runs upstairs to the bedroom and holds their daughter out the window, threatening to drop her if Madylyn leaves. Do you think I won't? Do you think I won't? he yells at her. She agrees to stay.Many years later, Jack Mabry(Robert DeNiro) and Madylyn (Frances Conroy) return home from church for a quiet afternoon. He watches TV and drinks in an identical pose to his younger self in the earlier scene, while she works on a puzzle. Late that night a call wakes them. Jack picks up the phone and hears a woman's voice. Betsy? he asks, obviously distressed. We find him at church the next day, speaking at his brother Bobby's funeral.Jack reports to work at a prison, where he's a parole officer. He listens to Christian radio in his car on the way in. Once there, we see him talk to different inmates but hear a persistent buzzing in the background as if to suggest that Jack has other things and pressures on his mind. He's called into the warden's office and asked to shut the door. The warden calls one of his reports an incompetent mess. before laughing and revealing he's joking. He then asks Jack to get Janice, his replacement, up to speed on his cases before he retires. Jack agrees, but requests that he keep all of his currents until he leaves, in order to see them through until their reviews. Janice offers condolences about Jack's brother. Jack has a new case in his office, named Gerald Creeson (Ed Norton) Jack reviews his file as if the man isn't there. He insists that he likes to be called Stone. Jack is hesitant to oblige, assuming it's a prison nickname. Stone asks Jack if he can help him get out early, pointing out that he acknowledged his guilt and isn't interested in talking about what he did when it's all in the file. Jack wants to talk about his crimes however, and Stone has an outburst assuming Jack isn't interested in helping. Stone dares him to give him the maximum and starts walking out. Jack then yells at him, letting him know that they talk about what he wants to talk about and demanding he sit the fuck down.Jack then explains, Look, this is the process, we talk. We're not friends, but let's pretend we're friends. Just relax. Just talk. That's all.Then maybe we both get what we want. OK? He then asks Stone about his wife, Lucetta. Stone describes her as a dime which he explains to Jack means a perfect ten. He also tells Jack that she's an alien. Jack assumes he means she's an illegal alien, but Stone says No. She's whiter than you. She's from another planet. Stone describes her sexuality graphically, telling Jack, She's crazy. She'll do anything. He warns Jack Look if we're gonna talk about Lucetta, you gotta watch out cause it's gonna give you some pictures in your head, gonna keep you up nights, man. When he notices that Jack doesn't look pleased, he apologizes for his mouth. Stone asks about Jack's wife. When Jack says he's been married 43 years, Stone remarks  43 years and you still get it on and everything? This offends Jack and Stone tries to explain, he's just curious about how he'll do when he's older. Jack explains that he doesn't discuss his wife that way. He tells Stone I don't consider this polite conversation. and reminds Stone that they're there to talk about him.Jack drives home listening to more radio, and buying a couple of bottles of booze on the way. He sits on the porch with Madylyn, both of them listening to a Christian radio program discussing predestination. Madylyn attempts to talk to him but he isn't even aware of it. She asks Where have you gone? Jack meets with Stone again and asks him to recount the arson incident. Stone tells him that Teach and his grandfather got into a fight which ended with Stone's grandparents dead, before Stone torched the house. Jack wants to talk more about it.
Jack: Whose idea was it?
Stone: I told you it was Teach! Like I said I wasn't even...I went outside the house.
Jack:Yeah, but you didn't stop him, did you?
Stone:Stop him what? Jack:From killing your grandparents.
Stone: You ain't gonna do it man. You're not gonna...You don't give a fuck man. I was outside. Teach come out and I didn't even know what he done until he told me. Teach testified to that, man! That's why I didn't even catch the rap for manslaughter. I got accessory and arson. I've done eight out of ten to fifteen. What more do you want, from me? Jack stares at him blankly.We then find Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) at a preschool working with kids. She smiles, telling the class that today is a day for them each to do one nice thing for someone else and not tell anyone about it.Madylyn is hosting a card game for her friends. She gets a phone call from a woman looking for Jack, the sound of the call is distorted, but the caller hangs up when she says she'd Mrs. Mabry and offers to take a message.Stone calls Lucetta from prison and catches her watching the kids at recess. Lucetta tells him that she was short with me, like she didn't want to talk. Stone asks Why were you talking to her? He tells her I need you to do this for me right now. Don't let it slide. She says OK. We see Stone having another meeting with Jack who says
I guess what I'm getting at, is do you believe what you did was wrong?
Stone: What do you think, because I grew up west side, that I'm one of these socio...delinquent types, don't know the difference between right and wrong? Want me to tell you about my bad childhood?
Jack: I don't know. Did you have one?
Stone: Well, at the time, I thought a lot of shit was normal...definitely unhealthy, but on the same token, i didn't think I was a bad person to begin with. You want to know if I'm gonna light any more grandparents on fire?
Jack: Are you?
Stone: No.
Stone tells him he deserves to be free, telling Jack I'm as clean as you. Jack says Maybe, maybe not.
Stone: Seriously, let me ask you something, you know? Why do you gotta sit there, asking me these questions, like you never done nothin'. Why do you get to walk around free and I don't?
Jack: I wasn't convicted of a crime.
Stone: You never did anything bad? You never did anybody no wrong, had to be forgiven for nothing?
Jack: I never broke the law.
Jack shuts him out, staring blankly again while Stone asks him about the many things he could have done. Stone claims he's been reborn, but can't answer when Jack asks what reborn means to him.Lucetta stops at the prison for a visit with Stone. She likes his cornrows, and the two are cautioned against contact when she starts kissing him passionately. He asks for an update on her contacting Jack. She tells him she's left messages and he hasn't called her back. He instructs her You've got to get with him person to person. She tells him she didn't wear panties just for him, and he touches her but restrains himself before getting carried away, not wanting to break the rules. He says I can't get no ticket.You understand right? I'm too close. She appears disappointed but agrees. He tells her he's got to get out or he's likely to kill himself, which she tells him not to joke about. Stone becomes fascinated with another prisoner reading the Bible to his son. After the visitation is over, he gets every religious book he can from the library.Nothing seems to catch until he finds one on Zukangor This religion is a patchwork of many and instructs that enlightenment can be achieved by hearing the perfect pitch making yourself like a tuning fork.That night Lucetta leaves a message on Jack and Madylyn's answering machine, before calling up a guy for sex. She's waiting for Jack outside the prison the next day. He tells her it isn't appropriate to meet this way, acting as if she's there to see Stone and reminding her of proper channels to do that. She then offers him a bird's nest that the kids in class made, which he refuses but then reconsiders when she describes the kids making it. Jack asks Stone about it, but he says that Lucetta does whatever she wants. Stone runs the Zukangor faith past Jack, describing the tuning fork idea and their practice of chanting then listening.. Jack isn't into the idea, saying he's Episcopalian. Stone explains that the religion also uses reincarnation, stating you have to come back until you get it right. Jack asks him What about this life? and Stone tells him he's thought about that a lot.Jack and Madylyn go to church, but Jack stays behind to talk with the pastor, telling Madylyn to go home. He tells the pastor that faith seems to come easy for people he knows but not to him, he says sometimes the thoughts that I have, I think you should shoot me. Pastor: I don't think that's what God wants for you.
Jack: What does he want?
Unable to give a concrete answer the pastor quotes a verse saying Be still and know that I am God. which he paraphrase to Jack as meaning sometimes God speaks in mysterious ways.In the prison yard, Stone tries the chanting, but seems to find it too noisy. Lucetta calls Jack's house again, Madylyn picking up the phone first. When Jack asks who it is she says a friend of yours. He tells Lucetta she shouldn't call the house, making a point to call her Mrs. Creeson although she insists on Lucetta every time. She wants to know when they can meet. Jack: Look Mrs Creeson, I have business with your husband...
Lucetta: Well that's why I'm calling. I mean, what, did you think I had another reason? Jack: Well, no, I didn't.
Lucetta: Maybe we could go to lunch. You could bring Mrs. Mabry too. You know she's got such a sweet voice, what's her first name? Jack: Look, I admire that you love your husband and that you want to do what's right for him, but you're not helping him. I'm telling you that right now. Lucetta: [raspy voice] Oh Jack I do love my husband. I love him so much, and all I'm asking you, is for a chance to help you see him in a different light. i mean, how many men at that place you work at have somebody loving them like that? huh? Doesn't that mean something to you? A man in a position like yours?
Jack: No. It does.
She describes how she misses him in her bed, and Jack goes quiet, looking around self consciously. Madylyn is somewhere close by. We then see Lucetta visiting Stone. She tells him I got him. It's gonna happen. Stone looks dead tired and looks at her coldly. He complains that it's too loud all the time and he's having weird dreams. He talks about suicide again, and she assumes he's referring to a dream, and then asks him if he ate spicy food before bed.Jack meets Lucetta for lunch. He starts talking about his grandchild, and mentions that his daughter's getting divorced, explaining People are gonna do what they're gonna do. She notices him fidgeting with back pain. She mentions magnet therapy as a suggestion for his back, explaining that the magnets remove toxicity, from cell phones and everything in the environment. Lucetta has an egg which she tells him she has to eat because the kids painted it. She offers it to him, making a voice to indicate the egg talking, she says Eat me. He says Why not. and takes a bite saying I'm just eating the healthy part. She says Go on, just eat the whole thing. They end up at Lucetta's place where she asks him if he feels the magnets. Madylyn sits at home on the porch in the dark, smoking cigarettes. Jack has a few drinks and ends up sleeping with Lucetta.Stone is lying in bed in his cell and two guards come to get him asking what's wrong and escorting him to Medical. While he waits for someone to see him he witnesses another inmate being brutally shivved. Stone sees it occur through a barred door, close enough that he gets blood on him. He reaches out to the dying man through the bars, wide eyed, as if he's realized something. We hear a high pitch in the background, as he looks in the dead man's eyes.At Jack's house the next morning, Madylyn reads from a devotional book aloud to Jack, asking To what extent is my commitment to obey God based on do's and don'ts or out of true love for him? In what recent circumstance was I aware of God's leading? She asks Jack, Why don't you say the blessing? which he does, saying a standard prayer but adding Make us mindful of the needs of others. eliciting a look from Madylyn. She asks Jack if he wants an egg, and he quickly declines.Stone sits in the cafeteria, looking more peaceful, and seems able to block out the noisy room. Jack drives listening to the radio which says We are not sinners because we sin. We sin because we are sinners. He goes to a field to drive golf balls, but soon goes to see Lucetta again for sex, which she seems pretty open about, telling Jack he's a good man for helping them while they're in bed. Jack tells her sternly that nobody is to know about this, warning that whatever it is she wants will all go bad if anybody knows. She just says Of course silly.Stone is out in the prison yard staring at the sky, and we see that he isn't affected by the noise. He goes in to visit Lucetta and asks her Do you ever wonder about things they say go on forever?
Lucetta: What? Stone: Things they say go on forever - like... what's that mean, you know? The sky, like, they say the sky goes on forever. But what is that really? That's - I mean, you can't see nothing you can't see, so... it's like a big bowl of blue above you. You can see clouds during the day or you can see stars at night maybe, but even with a telescope you can't see forever. So how do they know? Lucetta: Know what? Stone: What it is. Eternity - how do they know?
Lucetta changes the subject saying So Jack, he said the board's gonna review the whole thing. Okay? And they're gonna take into consideration your age and, you know, your Mom, and all that and the fact that you were an addict back then. [noticing he doesn't appear to be listening] Stoney baby, look at me. I was trying to tell you about your parole!
Stone: Yeah
Lucetta: Well, you weren't listening.
Stone: Oh yeah, I'm listening.I am.
Lucetta: Ok. So Jack said...
Stone: You call him Jack?
She explains what Jack plans to do and tells him it's great but Jack is distant. HE says Sometimes i think the best thing is to just listen. prompting her to cry and tell him to stop playing.Jack is angry when he comes into work the next day. He meets with Stone who attempts to explain something about his experience with the inmate who was shivved. Jack doesn't seem to get any sense of what he's saying, reading in his notes that Stone had a profound spiritual epiphany. Stone says he's never heard that word before, and tells him they can drop it. Jack says Don't get me wrong. I'd like to believe in such things.
Stone: Like what? Like me? You believe in me?
Jack: Sure, I'd like to believe in you too. That's why we're all here, right?
Stone attempts to describe it again, as a moment when all the static went away, and I could hear for real. He explains that he now sees that his life in prison isn't empty and pointless like he thought it was. He tells Jack, that the efforts he'd asked him for earlier aren't important to him anymore, saying You should do what you think is right. Okay? I am whatever you say I am in there. So write what you feel. Seriously. He explains that he wants to be out but is likely to have the same problems he's always had when he gets out.Jack stops by to see Lucetta again, and tells her what happened. She tells him it's probably some kind of play acting. and that he's always had different ideas about things. Jack tells her It was different. and asks her to be straight. Is this all just an act/ Just tell me what's going on. She tells him I don't do anything I don't want to do. I like you Jack. I would never fuck you if I didn't want to. He tells her he's not going to come by anymore but she tells him he will. She says that even after Stone gets out, they can still be friends too. Jack still tries to leave and she mentions that Stone is a good man at heart. He seems shacked and asks Do you really believe that. She says Yeah I do. no different than you and me. Jack asks if she goes to church ans Lucetta says Hell no. There's no such thing as God. Jack gets home and showers before going to bed.The next day, he tells Stone that he sent the report recommending early release. Stone seems antagonistic about it and surprised. He goes over the details of the night of the arson, describing seeing his grandparents dead when they were alive two minutes ago. He says that he heard a loud buzzing in his ears and knew that there needed to be a fire. He asks You ever seen a fire take control? It's something, It's alive. I watched it take them up and start to change them. And the only thought that came in my head was 'This is awesome.' Jack: Awesome?
Stone: Yeah. It was truly awesome. And the thing is, I know I'm supposed to take responsibility for my actions. I know that I'm supposed to feel guilty about it, but I never did, and I never knew why. But, now I think i can understand that it was just part of what was supposed to happen in my life's journey. You know?
Jack: That was your decision. He explains that they're all God's coworkers, without knowing it. Jack insists it has nothing to do with God and cuts him off. Jack: Enough of this shit. You know...You...Lucetta, she said that you were...
Stone: Lucetta?
Jack: Your wife she...
Stone: You call her Lucetta? Don't...
Jack: What?
Stone: Don't listen to her. Jack: What do you mean?
Stone: Don't listen to what she's telling you man.
Jack: She believes in you.
Stone: It's a game to her. It's a game. I told you in the beginning, she's an alien. She's like a freak.
Jack: That's not a nice thing to say.
Stone: No. Listen, I'm telling it to you straight. She's just working on you. Jack starts to get angry and tells Stone he's nuts that he has a beautiful wife that cares about you... but Stone asks beautiful? you think she's beautiful? leaving Jack speechless a moment.he recovers
Jack: Okay, you're a con, I've known that from the start. I didn't believe you for one fucking second. Never did. Never did. So you've both been conning me? Ok. I know. I've been around the block a few times. Sick and fucking tired of it.
Stone: What'd I say man?
Jack rants about being conned and his frustrations, that no one changes for the better. Stone asks him Do you have anyone? which only angers him more. Stone then advises him to blow your life up. I'm pulling for you. Jack gets irate and starts yelling at the guards to come grab Stone. JAck drives home without the radio. Late that night, Lucetta leaves a message on the machine, saying she needs him to call as she's in the dark on everything. The next morning the phone rings while he and Madylyn are eating breakfast and she tells him to let the machine get it, but he doesn't getting up to get the call, to find it's their daughter. That night he sits with Madylyn on the porch. She's been reading Zukangor, and tells Jack he started out as a stone, and worked his way up to human, and each incarnation has been paying off debts. He realizes she's reading from a flyer which she tells him was junk mail and she says You know what I think? I think we get this one life. I do. You account for what you've done and if you don't you pay for it when you die. You don't think? Jack: Oh [beneath his breath] Shit.
Madylyn: Shit. Shit. Son of a bitch. Fuck. Fuck.
Jack: Ok. I get it. Madylyn continues swearing at him, when Lucetta pulls up in the dark, and approaches the porch. Jack gets up to persuade her to leave. He calls her Mrs. Creeson and attempts to act official until they get to the car and he says Get in the fucking car. She asks what's going on with her husband and angrily says she just needed a friend to talk to, but drives away. He acts outraged about her coming to their home for Madylyn's benefit.At work in the morning, Jack is asking the warden for Stone's report back, explaining he made an error. The warden isn't happy, as the hearing is in an hour. The warden tells him that it doesn't matter as Stone's fate is already determined by luck and quotas. Jack doesn't stay for the hearing. We see that he takes his gun when he leaves the prison. Jack is at home drinking with Madylyn, who is discussing their devotional book. She mentions that they'll be looking at the commandments next. Jack asks her Do you believe in all this? and she tells him to read the next lesson. What request is on the top of my prayer list today? Is it a selfish request or is it one that will bring God glory?
Madylyn: I know what I want. How about you? You lost your place again? Is there something you want to say to me?
Jack: [shakes his head]
Madylyn: You don't?
Jack: I can't even think of what you'd want me to say.
Madylyn gets up from the table and leaves him there.Stone is informed that he'll be released.He stops in to see Jack while he's waiting. Stone asks if he wants to talk about anything, as he looks a little ragged. Jack reminds Stone that he can have him watched twenty four hours a day. Stone remarks Shit man, you don't believe in nothing do you? Jack: I believe you're one sick son of a bitch.
Stone: I know you don't believe in me, but you don't believe in yourself. You don't believe in God. I don't think you feel that anything is true inside.
Jack: I'll give you true. I'm glad you're out of my hair Gerald Creeson. Now you can be someone else's headache.Jack makes it clear he wants him out of the office. Lucetta shows up to pick him up and comes into the office. Stone asks if he can kiss her and Jack says that's fine. He tells her he's ready to go, but Stone turns back before leaving and says to Jack You know I want to thank you. Seriously. I appreciate everything that you've done for me.
Jack nods uncomfortably and looks at Lucetta and says Good luck to you too Mrs. Creeson. She answers. Lucetta, Jack. We're all friends here, right? He says Take good care of him. She whispers I will. You take good care too old man. See you later Jack. As Jack is about to shut the door behind them, Stone stops and says I meant to say, Lucetta, she did tell me that you fucked her. I know that must be against some kind of rule around here. Jack: I knew what you two were doing.
Stone: Oh, did you know what you were doing when you let my wife suck your cock? Jack: Good luck to you.
Stone: See you out on the bricks.
Jack: Good luck to you!Jack gets home and that night we see he's taking his gun out to the porch. He remembers Lucetta telling him she liked him as he tries to sleep. He thinks he hears noises downstairs and keeps his gun in hand to go look. He finds a fire downstairs, and goes to get Madylyn who is already awake. Watching the house burn Jack keeps taking the lord's name in vain, which she repeatedly tells him she won't stand for. He remarks that they were almost incinerated by some nutjob I let out. and she insist that nobody did this to us. It was an act of God. She makes up a story about frayed wiring in the kitchen wall and rags in the basement. Why would you say that? Jack asks and she say Because. it's as good a story as any.We see Madylyn with her daughter and granddaughter, looking through photo albums. Her daughter says I don't know how you stuck it out as long as you did. I'd think you'd have done this sooner. Madylyn says I almost did, once. although she doesn't answer when asked what happened?
Jack is at the bar with his coworkers, for his retirement party. He starts giving Janice, his replacement, advice about all the cons she'll be dealing with. He starts hitting on her, but she insists they keep things professional, but he starts swearing at her and then at the warden who steps in. They offer to drive him home but he insists on leaving himself. He listens to the radio, which is about God having Satan on the ropes, but Satan is flailing his arms which causes damage. Jack sees Stone walking down the street and approaches him with gun in hand asking why he ruined his life. Stone says Hey man you ain't gonna do this. which causes a reaction similar to the beginning with Jack saying You think i won't? You think I won't? with a gun to Stone's face. With the gun still on him, Stone shakes his head and says No. No I don't. He looks at Jack before walking away. Jack goes into work to clean his office. We hear the radio station again, and we hear Stone, describing the sound which brings spiritual truth and the tuning fork idea. Stone packs a bag and starts walking down the road. We see Lucetta at a bar trying to get a guy's attention. Madylyn smokes a cigarette alone looking over a fence. She hears a bee buzzing, which also seems to be heard by Jack, in his old office, who looks up from packing.

title: Coming to America
synopsis: Akeem Joffer, the heir to the throne of Zamunda (a fictional African kingdom), lives a pampered lifestyle with every daily task performed by servants. Akeem has become fed up with this and wishes to do more for himself. The final straw comes when his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aeoleon, present him with an arranged bride-to-be named Imani Izzi, whom he has never met and who has been trained to obey Akeem's every command. Akeem concocts a plan to travel to the United States to find an intelligent, independent-minded woman he can both love and respect, and who will love Akeem for who he is and not for his wealth and social status as a prince. Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, flip a coin to decide between going to either Los Angeles or New York City, and end up going to New York City. They end up in the borough of Queens and rent a run-down apartment in the neighborhood of Long Island City, passing themselves off as poor foreign students. They begin working at a local fast food restaurant called McDowell's—an obvious ripoff of McDonald's—owned by widower Cleo McDowell and his two daughters, Lisa and Patrice.
Akeem soon falls in love with Lisa, who possesses all the qualities that the prince is looking for in a woman, as first seen by Akeem at a rally where she makes a strong plea to renovate a playground. The rest of the film centers on Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's hand in marriage, which is complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks (Eriq La Salle), whose father owns Soul Glo (a Jheri curl–like hairstyling aid). Lisa eventually breaks up with Darryl after he announces their engagement (without Lisa having given her consent) to their families, and starts dating Akeem. Although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how commoners live, Semmi is not comfortable with living the life of a poor man. When Akeem randomly donates their travel money to the homeless Randolph and Mortimer Duke (characters in the previous Eddie Murphy film Trading Places), Semmi transmits a plea to the King of Zamunda for financial help. This causes Akeem's parents to travel to Queens and expose Akeem's identity as a prince to the McDowells.
Mr. McDowell, initially disapproving of the match as he did not want to see his daughter with a man of poor means, is ecstatic that she has in fact attracted the interest of an extremely wealthy prince, but Lisa becomes angry and confused as to why Akeem lied to her about his identity, as he had told her before that he was actually a Zamundan goat herder. Still hurt and angry that Akeem lied to her, she refuses to marry him, even after he offers to renounce his throne, and he returns home with a broken heart, resigned to marry the woman chosen for him by his parents. On the way to the airport, King Jaffe remarks that Akeem can't marry Lisa anyway because of tradition, and tries defending himself by saying Who am I to change it?, with Queen Aeoleon curtly responding, I thought you were the King.
At the final scene's wedding procession, Akeem, still heartbroken, waits dejectedly at the altar as his soon-to-be consort makes her way down the aisle. However, when Akeem lifts the veil to kiss her, he finds Lisa instead of Imani. Akeem and Lisa are married, and they ride happily in a carriage after the ceremony to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers to formally abdicate if she doesn't want a life like this, but Lisa playfully declines and decides to become royalty instead.

title: The Bridge on the River Kwai
synopsis: In the middle of World War II, two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a Japanese POW camp in southern Burma. One, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), is revealed to routinely bribe guards to ensure he is put on the sick list, which allows him to avoid hard labour.A large contingent of British prisoners under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) arrives, defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March as they march in. Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender, Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), addresses them, informing them of his rules. He insists that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all Burma.The next morning, when Saito orders everyone, including officers, to work, Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast. He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face, but the latter refuses to back down, even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers. Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton (James Donald), a British medical officer prisoner, citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers. Instead, the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat. As the day wears on, one of them collapses from heat stroke, but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work. After Colonel Nicholson is beaten in Saito's quarters, the British officers are sent into a punishment cage and Nicholson into his own box for solitary confinement.When Clipton requests to be allowed to check the officers, Saito agrees on the condition that Clipton persuade Nicholson to change his mind. Nicholson, however, refuses to budge, saying if we give in now there'll be no end to it. In the meantime, construction of the railroad bridge falls far behind schedule, due in part to many accidents purposely arranged by the British prisoners.Saito has a deadline; if he should fail to meet it, it would bring him great shame and oblige him to commit seppuku (ritual suicide). Saito reluctantly releases Nicholson, telling him that he has proclaimed an amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of Japan's great victory in the Russo-Japanese War, using it as an excuse to exempt the officers from work. Upon their release, Nicholson and his officers proudly walk through a jubilant reception. Saito for his part breaks down in tears in private.Having recovered from his ordeal physically, but not mentally broken, Nicholson sets off on an inspection of the bridge and is shocked to find disorganization, shirking and outright sabotage on the construction site. He decides that he will build a better bridge than the Japanese soldiers. He orders Captain Reeves (Peter Williams) and Major Hughes (John Boxer) to come up with designs for a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese. He wants to demonstrate to his captors what he considers superior British ingenuity and to also keep his men busy, which he feels would be better for morale than sitting around doing nothing in prison.Meanwhile, three men, one of them the American Shears, attempt to escape. Two are killed; Shears is shot, falls into the river and is swept downstream. After many days in the jungle, he stumbles into a Siamese village, whose residents help him recover and get back to safety. He's given food, water and an outrigger boat to make his way down the river. Shears runs out of water during the trip and is forced to drink the water from the river, which makes him ill. However, he makes it to the mouth of the river and is picked up by British forces and shipped to a British hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka (at the time, Ceylon). While recuperating, he dallies with a lovely nurse (Ann Sears).Major Warden (Jack Hawkins), a member of the British Special Forces, asks to speak with him. He informs Shears that he is leading a small group of commandos on a mission to destroy the Kwai bridge. He asks Shears to volunteer, since he knows the area. Shears refuses, finally admitting that he is not Commander Shears at all, but a Navy enlisted man. Shears recounts that he and a Navy Commander survived the sinking of their ship, but the Commander was subsequently killed by a Japanese patrol. Shears switched dog tags with the dead officer, hoping to get preferential treatment in captivity. It didn't work, but then he had no choice but to continue the impersonation. Warden tells him that the military already knew about it. To avoid bad publicity, the U.S. Navy loans him to the British. Warden offers him a deal: in exchange for his services, he will be given the simulated rank of major on the mission and avoid being charged with impersonating an officer, an offense punishable by death. Thus, Shears reluctantly volunteers with the understanding that should he survive, he'll get to keep his officer status. They are to be joined by Lieutenant Joyce (Geoffrey Horne), a young eager officer with no combat experience who insists that he won't fold under pressure should he have to kill someone on the mission, and a fourth officer.Back in the camp, Nicholson explains to the Japanese through engineering principles that they've selected a poor site for the bridge. Finally convinced, the original bridge is abandoned and construction of a whole new bridge is commenced 400 yards downriver. Clipton watches in bewilderment as Nicholson maniacally drives his men to complete the project by the deadline. Ironically, he even volunteers his junior officers to assist with the physical labor, something he had refused to consider earlier in the standoff with Saito - provided that the Japanese officers are willing to pitch in as well.Meanwhile, the commandos parachute in. The fourth officer dies due to a bad landing. The rest make their way to the river, assisted by native Burmese women porters and their village chief, Yai (M.R.B. Chakrabandhu). The commandos come upon a Japanese patrol whom they try to kill without firing shots, but Joyce freezes when confronted by one in the jungle. Warden jumps in front of him and kills the Japanese soldier, but gets shot in the foot as a consequence. This slows him down, but Shears refuses to leave him behind and the trio make their way to the bridge with the Burmese helpers.As the prison camp celebrates the completion of the bridge on time with a party for all, Shears and Joyce wire explosives to it under cover of darkness. The next day, a Japanese train full of soldiers and important officials is scheduled to be the first to use the bridge; Warden wants to blow it up just as the train passes over, accomplishing two missions at once.As dawn approaches, the trio notice with horror that the river has receded and the wires and explosives that were hidden the night before are now exposed. Nicholson proudly walks up and down his bridge making a final inspection, and notices the wires. The train can be heard approaching. Nicholson and Saito frantically hurry down to the riverbank, pulling up and following the wire towards Joyce who is waiting by the detonator. When they get too close, Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help and then tries to stop Joyce (who cannot bring himself to kill Nicholson) from getting to the detonator. A firefight erupts as Warden fires upon the approaching Japanese soldiers; Yai is killed in the gunfight. When Joyce is hit, Shears swims across the river to finish the job, but he too is shot just before he reaches Nicholson.Recognizing Shears, Nicholson suddenly comes to his senses and exclaims, What have I done? Warden desperately turns the mortar fire in their direction, killing Shears in the blast and mortally wounding Nicholson. The colonel stumbles over to the detonator plunger and falls on it with his dying breath, just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river.Warden, feeling guilty for killing Shears and Nicholson in the face of shocked stares from the Burmese women, pleads, I had to do it! They might have been taken alive! It was the only thing to do! Meanwhile, Major Clipton, the British medical officer who has witnessed all the carnage unfold from his vantage point on the hill, shakes his head incredulously, Madness! ... Madness!.

title: Rosemary's Baby
synopsis: New York City, fall of 1965: Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young married couple who rent an apartment in the gothic and splendorous Bramford building in Manhattan. At first, their friend and current landlord Edward Hutch Hutchins (Maurice Evans) tries to dissuade them from doing so: the building has a rather unsavory past. It has been occupied by cannibal killers, Satanists and witches, such as the Trench Sisters, Keith Kennedy, Pearl Ames--and the sinister Adrian Marcato, who created a scandal in the late 1890s by claiming to have conjured The Living Devil.Rosemary and Guy ignore him and move in. Guy is an actor with a fledging career. He's done plenty of TV plays and commercials, which have made him good money; but he wants great parts. Rosemary is a gentle soul, originally from Omaha, Nebraska, where she had been raised in a Catholic home and had attended convent school.As it is, Rosemary is estranged from her family, since they don't accept her marriage to Guy, who is not only an actor, but is also of mixed Jewish/Protestant upbringing. So her life in New York is all she has: she is a young housewife dedicated entirely to making a good home for her husband, whom she adores. She has a good circle of friends, but is at core sweetly naïve and lonely.One day in the laundry room, Rosemary makes the acquaintance of Terry Gionnoffrio (Victoria Vetri), a young former drug addict who was rescued from the gutter by an elderly, eccentric couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). The Castavets's apartment had formerly been the front part of theirs, but is now separated by a partition.Her friendship with Terry is short-lived. A few days after Rosemary meets her, Terry plunges to her death from the bay window. She and Guy are walking home when they see the police surrounding Terry's corpse. The Castavets happen to be walking home, too. Presumably distraught, they strike up an acquaintance with the Woodhouses and later invite them to dinner. Rosemary becomes suspicious about their new elderly friends, particularly the way that Roman insists on speaking with Guy in private. Other things trouble her, too, such as when Guy's career gets a jump start when his main rival, Donald Baumgart, suddenly goes blind. Now all he cares about is his new play.But then suddenly, he decides he wants to become a father. Rosemary is thrilled.Evidently having studied her ovulation cycle himself, he announces the ideal baby night. That evening, Minnie drops by to give them some chocolate mousse--or mouse as she calls it. Rosemary complains of a chalky undertaste, but Guy gets angry over her ingratitude. She eats part of it, and then furtively hides the rest in her napkin.Suddenly feeling disoriented after dinner, she passes out and has a bizarre dream. Rosemary is floating on a mattress in the sea, visits a cruise ship with the Kennedy's, has her wedding band removed, is carried through the Sistine Chapel, a brief shot of the linen closet with guy saying easy, you got her too high then she's back on the cruise ship naked and told by the skipper go below the deck and passes by a burning church and lays down on a mattress. The unsettling dream becomes a nightmare when she finds herself surrounded by naked elderly people, a statue figure of a bearded man staring down at her, and two men tie her to a bed. Then Jackie Kennedy soothes her for not feeling well. Guy approaches her bed, but then something that looks and feels inhuman brutally rapes her. This is no dream! she cries. This is really happening! Pope Paul VI, then visiting NYC and having mass at Yankee Stadium, comes to offer her absolution.When she wakes up, Rosemary is sore and scratched. Guy half-heartedly apologizes for having had her while she was out. Rosemary is angry, but baby night later proves successful. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin)--referred to her by her girlfriend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henry)--confirms it.Upon hearing the news, the Castevets persuade Rosemary to go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), a prominent obstetrician who delivers all the upper crust babies in the city. Rosemary entrusts herself to him, accepting his odd advice and his recommendation of Minnie's strange vitamin drinks. She develops pain during her first trimester, which causes her to lose weight and look emaciated, alarming Hutch--but not the doctor, Guy, the Castevets or their Saturday night gang of quaint old timers, including Dr. Stan Shand (Phil Leeds) and the obnoxious Laura-Louise McBurney (Patsy Kelly).As her pregnancy progresses, Rosemary feels a mounting sense of dread and angst. What is wrong with her? Why won't anyone acknowledge it? She decides to throw a party for her young friends, a qualification she insists upon. Her girlfriends--including Elise, Joan Jellico (Marianne Gordon) and Tiger Hoanigsen (Wende Wagner)--tell her she looks awful and that her pain is far from normal. She has to see a new doctor. Rosemary tells Guy, and they fight bitterly over it. But at the last minute she relents. The pain has suddenly stopped. And now she can feel the baby kicking.Rosemary's friend Hutch drops by for a visit; Roman and Minnie spot him, and suddenly Guy arrives home unexpectedly, as if they'd phoned him and urged him to rush back to the apartment. Hutch asks a lot of questions of Roman and Guy, and before he leaves the apartment, he realizes he's misplaced one of his gloves. Later, Hutch falls into a mysterious coma and dies. Rosemary receives a book from Hutch's companion, Grace Cardiff (Hanna Landy), which Hutch had intended to give to Rosemary personally. It's called All of Them Witches, a study on witchcraft through the ages, featuring a chapter on Adrian Marcato (his appearance is familiar from the dream) and his son, Steven. The name is an anagram, is the final clue Hutch had left for her. Rosemary uses her Scrabble tiles to learn the horrible truth: Roman Castevet is Steven Marcato.Now she suspects Roman, Minnie and all their all-too-helpful friends are Satan worshipers. She visits Dr. Sapirstein and tells him she'll have no more to do with them. It's just as well, Sapirstein informs her: Roman is dying and would like to go away to Europe on a farewell tour. Rosie feels guilty about her suspicions, and when the time comes, bids them a fond farewell.But not all is what it seems. As her due date--June 28, 1966--nears, she learns one strange thing after the other. Could it be that Guy is involved with witches? Witches use babies for their rituals. Has he promised them the baby? She also learns that witches use the belongings of their intended victims to blind or kill them. On a hunch, she contacts Guy's former rival, Donald Baumgart, and gets him to reveal that Guy swapped ties with him just before he went blind.Distraught, Rosemary packs a suitcase and goes to Dr. Sapirstein to tell him what she's learned. But his secretary's off-hand remark reveals something horrible--the good doctor sometimes smells like tannis root, which she has learned is more commonly called Devil's Pepper. Dr. Sapirstein is a witch, too. He must be part of the plot against her. Next, Rosemary persuades Dr. Hill to see her. When she reveals her suspicions to him, he seems to take her seriously, and he gives her a sedative to help her sleep, but she is horrified when she awakens and find that Guy and Dr. Sapirstein have arrived to take her back home. She manages lock them out of the apartment, but before she can call for help, Guy and the others appear in the apartment, having entered by some other means. Rosemary tries to fight them off and she goes into labor. They have to force her down on her bed, while Sapirstein injects her with something to make her sleep.When she wakes, Guy tells her she has had a boy and that he's fine. But later, Sapirstein tells her that the baby is dead. The coven members sit with Rosemary, collecting her breast milk, and she thinks she can hear a baby crying through the walls of the apartment. She knows they have taken the baby, and she thinks they are planning to sacrifice it for one of their rituals.After a few days of pretending to cooperate and take her sedatives, Rosemary arms herself with a sharp butcher knife and finds the partition between her apartment and the apartment of the Castavets. Removing the closet interior, she finds the hidden doorway to the other apartment and goes inside. She looks at an oil painting of a burning church whispering you got her too high, apparently having a flashback of the dream. She discovers the entire coven sitting in the living room around a bassinet, including Minnie and Roman. A photo of Adrian Marcato is up above the mantle. There are others there, too, that Rosemary does not recognize, people that seem to have come from as far away as Japan. She approaches the bassinet and sees the baby for the first time, horrified that the baby has strange eyes. He has his father's eyes, Roman tells her, and the coven tells her that Satan is the baby's father, not Guy. Guy tells her that he made an agreement with the coven to allow them to impregnate Rosemary with the spawn of the Devil in exchange for a successful acting career. Rosemary spits in his face. Now totally beaten, she collapses into a chair and Minnie brings her a cup of tea. Roman speaks more gently to her and encourages her to be the baby's mother, and although she hesitates at first, her maternal instincts win out, and the film ends as she rocks the baby's cradle and sings to him.

title: Up in the Air
synopsis: The opening credits roll over a montage of aerial shots of the ground as seen from an airplane in flight, as Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings sing This Land Is Your Land. The plane lands and we see a series of talking heads -- people who have just been fired. Their reactions run the gamut from incredulousness and sadness to anger, and are directed at Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who is sitting calmly behind a desk. He works for CTC, Career Transition Counseling. In a voice-over, Ryan introduces himself: I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss, who don't have the balls to sack their own employees. There's a quick montage of retaliatory actions a disgruntled fired employee might engage in (pouring bleach in the coffee, sniper shooting), and we see Ryan offer a pat, sincere consolation to Steve, a fired employee.In a hotel room, experienced traveler Ryan expertly packs his suitcase. We see him drop off his rental car at an airport, bypassing the vacationers in the airport to check in at the frequent flyer desk, and powering through security with practiced moves as his voice-over lyrically describes the airport as his home. In first class, the stewardess asks him, Cancer? He looks at her quizzically. Cancer? He is confused, and she holds up a soft drink can, repeating, patiently: Can, sir? He shakes his head quickly and politely declines.Next, Ryan gives a motivational speech, Unpacking Your Backpack, where he admonishes a thin crowd in a nondescript hotel meeting room to consider how uncomplicated their lives would be if they didn't have responsibility for so many things: knick-knacks, photos, furniture, homes, and relationships. Imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It's kinda exhilarating, isn't it? The crowd is underwhelmed. Back at the airport, Ryan strides into a frequent flyer lounge flashing his membership card, where he is cheerfully greeted. He calls his office and talks to Kevin, an assistant, who tells him that he has been invited to appear at GoalQuest XX in Las Vegas as a motivational speaker. Ryan is excited; GoalQuest is a very high-profile conference. He is transferred to his boss, Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), who asks him to come back to Omaha by the end of the week for big news. In a Dallas Hilton bar, Ryan trades frequent traveler observations with an attractive blonde businesswoman, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). They compare perks cards, and she's impressed by his American Airlines Concierge Key. (Carbon fiber? she inquires. Graphite, he responds modestly.) She mentions that she flies about 60,000 miles a year, and Ryan politely says, Not bad. She challenges him to disclose his mileage number. The challenge turns into verbal foreplay as she teases him on the size of his number. Is it this big? (Holds hands a few inches apart.) this big? (Holds hands further apart.) He mentions that he has a lifetime mileage goal in mind, but won't say what it is. Later, they swap stories about the most outré places they have had sex, and she declares that she has done it in an airline lavatory on a regional flight. They end up in bed together, and later compare calendars to see if they will be in the same town sometime soon. She decides to return to her room, and he agrees that that would be the ladylike thing to do.The next morning, he goes through what is obviously a routine: his workout in the hotel pool, a shoe shine, and the airport. While waiting for his plane, he receives a call from his sister Kara (Amy Morton), who is discussing the wedding of their sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey). Kara is sending him a cardboard cutout of Julie and her fiancé because Julie wants him to take a photo of the cutout in Las Vegas at the Luxor pyramid. He reluctantly agrees.Omaha: Voice-over: Last year I spent 322 days on the road, which meant I spent 43 miserable days at home. Ryan enters his small studio apartment, which has less personality than a hotel room: minimal utilitarian furniture, no decorations. His neighbor, a diffident young woman, brings over a package that she has signed for: the cutout that his sister wants him to photograph. He invites his neighbor over, and she awkwardly declines, telling him that she is now seeing someone. Ryan is unconcerned.At a staff meeting, Craig is chortling that the economic downturn has created a wonderful opportunity for their firm, and introduces Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a fresh young up-and-comer who has recently graduated at the top of her class at Cornell. Natalie introduces an on-line monitor that will be used to fire people from a remote location over the internet, eliminating the need for human resource specialists such as Ryan to travel. Ryan is appalled at the impersonality of the process -- and, we suspect, at the loss of his travel privileges. After the meeting, he goes to Craig's office to protest. Natalie joins them, and Ryan tells her that she knows nothing of the realities of firing a person. She brightly tells him that she majored in psychology, and Ryan challenges her to fire him. She takes on the challenge, and tries to fire him, failing miserably. Later, Craig accuses him of not being a team player and becoming a dinosaur. Craig tells Ryan that Natalie will be accompanying him on the road for the next few days to learn the ropes, much to Ryan's chagrin.At home, Ryan packs for another road trip -- his shelves are as sparse as his apartment, utilitarian, containing nothing that is not traveling business attire. He is chagrined when he realizes that he has to carry the cut-out, which does not quite fit into his luggage. At the airport, he checks in with his usual efficiency, and then sighs when he sees Natalie arriving with a large, impractical suitcase. He forces her to buy a suitcase that will fit in the overhead compartment, telling her that he flies over 370 days a year, and that not checking luggage saves him the equivalent of a week a year. He ruthlessly pares her packing, tossing things he deems unnecessary into the trash. In the security line, he gives her the benefit of his traveling experience: Never get behind families or old people and try to find an Asian, because Asians travel light, wear slip-on shoes, and therefore move through security faster. Natalie: That's racist! Ryan: I stereotype -- it's faster.St. Louis: Alex calls Ryan as Ryan and Natalie are heading for the car rental. She's in Atlanta, and they try to match up overlapping time somewhere. They agree to meet at SDF (Louisville). Ryan and Natalie enter another office and begin their job of firing people. Natalie is instructed to stay quiet and simply hand them their benefits package, but she can't resist piping up with an inanity when a man called Bob (J.K. Simmons) asks what his family is supposed to do when he is on unemployment. Ryan, who has taken the time to read Bob's resume, rescues the interview by helping him realize that this is an opportunity for him to follow his dream of being a chef. Bob leaves, resigned but less angry.Ryan bypasses a long line of people to check in at the Hilton Honors desk. An irate customer protests that Ryan just waltzed to the front of the line, but a smiling desk clerk tells her, We reserve priority assistance for our Hilton Honors members! Ryan helpfully hands the customer a brochure, and, still irate, she snatches it from him. At dinner with Natalie, Ryan orders several dinners to use up his $40 per diem. Natalie is surprised, and he tells her that he tries not to spend a nickel that doesn't go towards his frequent flyer miles. She asks why, and he tells her that he is aiming for ten million miles. She scoffs at what she deems to be a meaningless hobby, but he points out that that he would be only the seventh person to attain that level, and goes on to describe the award: lifetime executive status, meeting the chief pilot, Maynard Finch, and getting his name painted on the side of a plane. Natalie is unimpressed, and declares that if she had those miles, she'd show up at the airport, pick a place, and go.That evening, in bed, Ryan looks at his sister's wedding invitation. He receives text messages from Alex that quickly become sexually suggestive. He responds, smiles, and turns out the light.The next morning, Natalie helps Ryan by taking a photo of the cutout in front of the St. Louis airport. She doesn't understand the significance of the airport, and Ryan explains the Wright Brothers flew here! and goes on to ask Natalie if she never wondered why Charles Lindbergh's plane was called Spirit of St. Louis. Dismissively, she tells him no, she never wondered.Wichita: Another office. Another firing, but the employee is angry. Afterwards, Ryan tells Natalie that sometimes, they just need to vent. Natalie is taken aback, but wants to try firing the next person, who at first appears to take the news calmly, but then announces in the same calm fashion that There's this beautiful bridge by my house. I'm going to go jump off it. Natalie is distraught, and races from the building. Ryan reassures her that people say all sorts of things while they are being fired, and never mean them.Kansas City: They enter an office that has been decimated -- only a few employees remain, and the receptionist is resigned when she sees them. In the hotel, Ryan overhears Natalie talking to her boyfriend as she declares, I don't even think of him that way -- he's OLD. Ryan is taken aback. Alex joins him, and they enter a hotel room.Des Moines: Another office, another firing. Natalie is starting to feel the emotional strain.Miami: Ryan is giving another motivational talk, which he continues with the same allusion to getting rid of human connections, because relationships are the heaviest components of their lives. He declares, The slower we move, the faster we die . . . we're sharks, we have to keep moving. Returning to the hotel, Natalie challenges Ryan about never getting married. He declares he is never getting married, and invites her to try to sell him on the idea of marriage. He's not buying. As they continue the discussion in the hotel lobby, Ryan wraps up the argument by declaring make no mistake, we all die alone. Natalie suddenly dissolves in great sobbing tears and announces that her boyfriend, Bryan, has left her. As she falls sobbing into Ryan's arms, he sees Alex descending the stairs. Ryan introduces Alex to Natalie, and over drinks, Alex commiserates with Natalie: He broke up with you by text? What a prick! Ryan slyly agrees: Almost as bad as being fired by internet. Natalie glares at him. Natalie goes on to tell them that she moved to Omaha to follow Bryan, giving up a good job offer in San Francisco, and goes on to lament that no matter how much success she might have professionally, it won't matter unless she finds the right guy. She has a mental schedule of deadlines that she had hoped to accomplish, and earnestly declares that she could have made her relationship with Bryan work because he met most of her requirements. Alex and Ryan smile and tell her that deadlines pretty much go out the window after a certain age. Alex goes on to explain that at 34, her expectations for a man have radically changed and describes the kind of man she'd like. Ryan listens with interest. Natalie observes that that's depressing. We should just date women. Alex says, matter-of-factly, Tried that. We're no picnic ourselves, to Ryan's surprise. Natalie says that she doesn't want to settle, and Alex tells her that she's young, so settling seems like failure. Natalie declares, earnestly, that is IS failure, by definition.As they return to their rooms, Natalie asks what the plans for the evening are. Alex and Ryan are taken aback and had obviously not expected to include her in their plans. Ryan announces that they are going to hit the party for the tech conference that is being held in the hotel. Natalie says that she didn't know they were registered, and Alex and Ryan hem and haw until Natalie realizes that they are planning to crash the party, at which point she enthusiastically declares, I'm in! They casually walk up to the registration desk, grab some unclaimed badges, and enter the party. Natalie has inadvertently picked up a name tag for Jennifer Chu, but Ryan assures her that no one will notice. Natalie quickly downs a few drinks and begins to mingle, meeting a man called Dave. (This is a reference to Natalie's list of preferences in a boyfriend -- one of the odder items was a one-syllable name like Matt or ... Dave.) Ryan and Alex dance. The MC comes on stage to sing and gets the crowd amped up. Later, Ryan offers Alex his hotel room key, the key to my place, and Alex takes it, commenting lightly that she didn't realize they were at that point in their relationship. On an evening boat ride with other members of the conference, Natalie sings karaoke and Ryan and Alex sit at the back of the boat talking. Alex tells Ryan that she never has a chance to act this way at home, and asks him about his motivational philosophy: Is the bag empty because you hate people or you hate the baggage that they come with? He comments that recently, he's been thinking about emptying the backpack, and what he'd put back in it. He smiles, they kiss and at that moment, the boat loses power. A speedboat rescues them and ferries them to shore, where they have to splash through the surf to the beach. Laughing and drenched, the crowd scurries into the hotel. The next morning, Ryan wakes to see Alex finishing getting dressed -- she has stayed the night. She says that if she catches a standby, she can make a meeting in Cincinnati. Ryan looks momentarily disappointed, and she chides him playfully, Oh, I made you feel cheap! They laugh, and as she leaves, Ryan tells her, Hey -- I really like you.At breakfast at a poolside table, Natalie tries to apologize for what she might have said or done the night before, and Ryan tells her that it was good to see her cut loose. He then asks her if she woke him up or slipped out (referring to the man she picked up at the party). Natalie admits that she just slipped out, and Ryan observes, the protocol's always tricky.As they are taking another picture of the cutout against the Miami skyline, Natalie asks Ryan questions about Alex, finally asking, so, what kind of relationship do you have? He tells her that it's casual, and Natalie asks if there's a future. Ryan tells that he hadn't thought about it, but Natalie becomes annoyed. Ryan tries to explain: You know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you can feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet just for a second? Natalie nods, Yes! Ryan declares, Yeah, well, I don't. Angrily, Natalie throws down the cutout on the dock and declares that he's an asshole, Alex might be a chance at a real relationship, and then goes on to tell him that his philosophy is bullshit, he has a cocoon of self-banishment and that he has set up a way of life that makes it impossible for him to have any kind of human connection. She storms off, and the cutout blows into the water. Ryan tries to reach it, but falls into the water, too. Back in his room, he carefully blow dries the picture, but safely tucked in the suitcase on the way to Detroit, it is a bit worse for wear.Detroit: Ryan warns Natalie that Detroit is a rough town and that the employees are touchy and will be difficult. When they enter the office, Ryan is surprised to see a computer monitor sitting on the table. Craig greets them from the screen -- he has arranged for a trial run of the internet-based firing procedure. They will be at a desk in the next room, but will only talk to the employees via screen. Natalie takes the first employee. At first, he is belligerent -- they can hear him bellowing in the next room through the thin walls -- but he later starts to sob disconsolately. Natalie is distressed, but hides it behind some stock encouraging phrases. She sends the employee away, and takes a deep breath. Craig has been monitoring the exchange, and is thoughtful. Ryan tells her, unconvincingly, that she did good as she looks forlornly at the list of employees -- this was the first of over fifty employees that will be released.In the parking lot, Natalie leans against the car as Ryan talks to Craig, trying to convince him that they are still needed on the road. After the conversation, he resignedly tells Natalie that Craig has called them off the road: We're going home. At the airport, Ryan stares out the large plate glass window, gazing at an airplane that has a large white area on the side, just waiting for a name to be painted on it. He looks at his sister's wedding invitation, and realizes that the date is this weekend and he has never returned the RSVP card. As they walk through the airport, Natalie tries to apologize for what she said about Alex, and Ryan ungraciously accepts her apology. Suddenly, he turns and tells Natalie that he will meet her in Omaha, but he's got to catch another flight.Las Vegas: Ryan meets Alex and gets the requested photo of the cutout in front of the Luxor pyramid. Ryan invites Alex to his sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Surprised, Alex demurs, but finally agrees, and they fly into Milwaukee.Northern Wisconsin: At the Chalet, a pseudo-Tyrolean motel, Ryan and Alex wait in the check-in line. Seeing a clerk behind the desk, Ryan asks her if she is free, but she condescendingly tells him, This line is only for members of our Matterhorn program! As he enters his room with Alex, his sister Kara comes out of her room, and he introduces Alex to Kara. Kara is surprised: Ryan has told me . . . nothing about you. She tells him that she is staying at the hotel because she and her husband are having a trial separation, and reminds him of the rehearsal dinner that evening. At dinner, Julie is pleased to see Ryan and meet Alex. She proudly shows off a small, diamond chip ring that her fiancé Jim designed, and introduces Jim (Danny McBride), who is friendly in an awkward sort of way. Ryan offers her the photos that he has taken, and she asks him to pin them to a map that contains dozens and dozens of photos. Ryan has a hard time fitting his in. They explain that all of Jim's money is tied up in a real estate investment and made a honeymoon unfeasible financially, so the photos would be the next best thing.After the dinner, Ryan offers to walk Julie down the aisle the next day since their dad isn't around, but embarrassed, she gently refuses, telling him that Jim's uncle will be escorting her. Ryan is somewhat hurt, but puts a good face on it and tells her that he just wanted to make sure she was covered. Julie is distressed that she might have hurt his feelings but when he asks when he should be at the church, she tells him, Well, guests are supposed to be there at 5:00 so, 5:00 would be good, again relegating him to the status of a mere guest.The next day, Alex and Ryan break into the local school so that Ryan can show her around. He points out his state basketball championship photo in the trophy case. Alex is surprised, and they end up kissing on the make-out stairs behind the gym. They sit down to watch a practice, but his cell phone rings: It's Kara, who tells him that hes needed at the church.Alex drops him off at the church and returns to the hotel to grab his suit. Julie is distraught because Jim has gotten cold feet. Kara wants him to talk to Jim, but Ryan points out that he might not be the best one, because his job is to tell people how to avoid commitment. What kind of fucked up message is that? exclaims Kara. It could have helped you, he retorts, referring to her separation, but reluctantly agrees to talk to Jim. He finds him in a Sunday school classroom reading The Velveteen Rabbit. Jim tells him that he began to think about what his life was going to be like: house, children, jobs, losing his hair, and then dying, and wonders what the point is. Ryan observes that a good marriage is something that people aspire to, but Jim points out that Ryan was never married, and that he seems happier than anyone else he knows. Ryan agrees that there's no point to it all, but points out that the most important moments of his life had other people involved, and observes that life is better with company, with a co-pilot. Jim accepts this, and then asks What's it like out there? Ryan admits that Julie is upset. Jim comes out and apologizes to Julie, asking her Will you be my co-pilot? Julie tearfully agrees, and the wedding proceeds. Alex and Ryan hold hands during the vows, and dance intimately at the reception.At the airport, Alex asks when she will see Ryan again and Ryan tells her that she's going to have to come visit him, since he's been essentially grounded. She moves to her gate and tells him to call me when you get lonely. As she walks away, he calls out, I'm lonely. She laughs, and keeps walking. In Omaha, back at his apartment, he puts his things away, and looks around, dissatisfied. He opens the refrigerator to reveal an impressive collection of airline miniature booze bottles in the refrigerator door.At the office the next morning, Natalie proudly shows him around the call center that is being beta tested, and comments that the workers are called termination engineers. I wanted to call them Terminators, but was that bumped by Legal. I can't imagine why, Ryan responds drily. Ryan sits at a desk and distastefully tries on a headset. He checks the internet for the schedule for GoalQuest XX, and sees when he is scheduled to speak.Las Vegas: Ryan prepares for his speech, and as he is introduced to a crowd of several hundred, he takes the podium with his backpack. He begins the spiel that we have heard before but then stops and gazes out over the audience. He looks down at the podium, shakes his head ruefully, excuses himself, and walks out, to the consternation of the event organizers. He dashes through the airport and catches a flight to Chicago, where he arrives in the evening.Chicago: In a hurry, Ryan steps out of his routine and drives away without giving the car clerk his rewards card. He pulls up in front of Alex's townhouse and rings the doorbell. Alex comes to the door. She is shocked as he says, smiling, So, I was in the neighborhood . . . Suddenly, he hears children arguing and we see them running in the hall behind Alex. Ryan begins to back away, and with a stricken look on Alex's face, we hear a male voice ask, Who's at the door, honey? She closes the door gently as she responds, Just someone asking directions.At the hotel, Ryan sits on a bed in a darkened room with a drink, staring out into the evening. On the train to the airport the next morning, he receives a call from Alex, who demands, What were you thinking, showing up at my door like that? He protests that he didn't know she was married, and she declares that he could have seriously messed up her real life, and that she thought he understood. He said that he thought he was part of her real life, and asks her to help him understand. She tells him that he is an escape, an escape from their normal lives, a parenthesis. A parenthesis? he repeats, dully. Alex is unapologetic. Well, what did you want? If you want to see me again, give me a call. He hangs up on her gently.In the air: Returning to Omaha, Ryan is gazing out the window when the flight attendant comes on the intercom to excitedly announce that they are flying over Dubuque, which means that a startled Ryan has hit the 10 million miles mark. Champagne is brought for all the first class passengers, and Chief Pilot Maynard Finch (Sam Elliott) greets Ryan. He sits in the seat next to Ryan and congratulates him, telling him that he's the youngest yet to get to 10 million. He pulls out the special silver card, engraved Ryan Bingham, #7, and presents it to Ryan, telling him that they really appreciate Ryan's loyalty. Ryan is speechless, and tells the Captain that he forgot what he always wanted to say at that moment. The Captain asks him where he's from, and Ryan, looking down, says softly, I'm from here.Omaha: In his office, Ryan looks at his card, and, making a decision, dials the number on the card. He is greeted with a cheery Good morning, Mr. Bingham! Surprised, he asks how they knew it was him, and is told that it's his dedicated line. He begins to make arrangements to transfer miles to Julie and Jim for an around-the-world trip, which costs half-a-million miles each.Craig comes into his office and asks him if he remembers a Karen Barnes whom Natalie fired. Ryan says that they have fired dozens of people, and he doesn't remember. Craig tells him that Karen jumped off a bridge and killed herself, and he needs to know if she gave any indication of her intentions, which could get them into trouble legally. Ryan says he doesn't remember anything, and asks if Natalie is all right. Craig tells him that Natalie quit by sending him a text message. Fucking nice, right? Nobody has any manners anymore, he grouses, and goes on to tell Ryan that he is returning the workforce to the field.San Francisco: Natalie is interviewing for the job she was offered when she first graduated from Cornell. The interviewer asks her why she went to Omaha, and she reluctantly admits that I followed a boy. After a few searching questions, the interviewer shows Natalie a letter of recommendation that he has received from Ryan. The letter is glowing, and the interviewer offers her the job.A montage of interview clips follows. Employees whom we have seen being fired throughout the movie are in some sort of interview/counseling session. Each in their own way, they explain that while losing their job was difficult, it was made easier by the support of their friends and families.Ryan enters an airport, suitcase in tow, and comes to stand in front of a large Departures and Arrivals board, gazing at the flight details. He releases the suitcase and stands in front of the board with no baggage. We hear Ryan's voice-over: Tonight, most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids. Their spouses will ask about their day, and tonight they'll sleep. The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places and one of those lights, slightly brighter than rest, will be my wingtip passing over. The credits roll over a view of early evening blue clouds as seen below from an airplane, with a faint sunset in the far distance.

title: After Hours
synopsis: New York City. Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunn) is a lonely and bored computer word-processing consultant who wants more in his life than just going to work and going home every boring day of his life. One day involves teaching a new trainee, named Lloyd (Bronson Pinchot), the works of the computer. Paul leaves the office building when it closes at the end of the day and goes to his Upper East Side apartment on East 91st Street where he wastes the evening away watching TV and reading Arthur Miller books.Venturing out in search of carnal pleasures, Paul meets the sexy-but-quirky Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) in a coffee shop near his apartment building and begins chatting up a conversation with her. Paul asks for Marcy's phone number before she leaves and she tells him that he can call her anytime. Back at his apartment, Paul works up enough nerve to phone Marcy. She invites him to come down to SoHo where she is staying with Kiki, and artist friend of hers. The time is 11:32 p.m.Paul jumps into a taxi cab outside his apartment... and then the weirdness begins. The burly cab driver whisks Paul through the streets of New York at 80 mph as if being chased by the hounds of hell. During the wild ride, Paul loses a $20 bill, the only money he has on him when its whisked out the car window, and he is forced to stiff the driver. Paul finds the loft and meets Kiki (Linda Fiorentino) for the first time, who's wearing nothing but a black bra and leather miniskirt, working on a paper-maché sculpture that resembles painter Edvard Munch's 'The Scream'. Kiki forces Paul to help her work on the sculpture in which he stains his suit jacket and Kiki gives him another one to wear.Eventually, Marcy shows up and they go out to a nearby diner where they talk about their favorite movie which is The Wizard of Oz, among other things. When offered to pay the bill, the strange diner waiter (Dick Miller) tells Paul that it's on the house. (Different rules apply when it gets this late, you know what I mean? It's like... after hours.)At 1:40 a.m., Marcy and Paul return to the loft, where she ushers Paul to her bedroom. Marcy prattles on about events in her tragic life, delivering her lines with a staccato rhythm punctuated by a nervous laugh. Marcy turns out to be a hyperactive mass of contradictions, and Paul decides that swaying her emotions are a bit too weird to handle. After smoking a joint of Marcy's which she claims it's from Columbia, Paul, for some reason, begins begins acting like a jerk and leaves.When he on the street, it begins raining, and he gets soaked walking a block to the nearest subway station. He picks out about 97 cents in change, all the money he has on him. But the attendant tells Paul that the subway fare for a token has just gone up to $1.50 that very midnight, and the time is now 2:15 am. Paul begs the attendant to give him a single token, but the attendant refuses saying, I can't do that. Id loose my job. Paul looks around the station, sees no one and sarcastically states, Well, who would know... exactly? The attendant responds, I could go to a party, get drunk, talk to someone... who knows? When Paul threatens the attendant, a burly transit cop appears and scares Paul away.Paul runs through the rain and into a nearby bar, which is nearly empty, save for a bartender, a middle-aged waitress, and a teenage dancing couple. Paul sits at a table and asks the waitress Julie (Terri Garr) if he could just sit there for a while without buying anything. She agrees. After Paul uses the men's room, he returns to his table and finds a note sliped by the waitress which reads: Help me! I hate this job! Sensing that the weirdness is starting again, Paul asks the friendly bartender Tom (John Heard) if he can borrow money for a subway fare to get home. Tom is glad to help. But Tom cannot open the cash register. Tom asks Paul to go to his apartment a few blocks away to get the cash register keys as well as to check if the alarm is turned on because there have been a rash of burglaries in the neighborhood over the past several days. As a sign of trust, Paul leaves his apartment keys with Tom and rushes off with Tom's apartment keys to earn his $1.50. Paul lets himself into Tom's apartment, checks the alarm which is on. After using the toilet, it overflows, and Paul leaves. But on his way out, Paul gets hassled by two neighbors, a gay couple, who suspect that Paul is a burglar. Paul manages to get away from them.On the street, Paul spots two Hispanic men (Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong) trying to stuff Kiki's paper-maché sculpture into a van. Paul gives them chase, forcing them to drop the statue and drive off. Paul brings the statue back to Kiki's loft nearby and finds her gagged and tied to a pillar. He unties Kiki thinking that they robbed her, but she tells them that the men are Pepe and Neil, friends of hers who just bought the stature and that she's tied up because she and her boyfriend Horst (Will Patton) are playing a sex game. Kiki and Horst tell Paul that he should apologize to Marcy who has been in her bedroom crying since Paul left. Paul goes to Marcy's bedroom to apologize only to discover that Marcy has committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. He runs to tell Kiki, but she and Horst have gone, leaving a note saying that they have gone to a nightclub.Paul sees a $20 bill left behind by them and instinctively takes it. Paul calls the police to report the body, and then dashes back to the bar so he can get his apartment keys back from Tom, but finds the place closed. Julie the waitress approaches him and invites him to her apartment just across the street to wait for Tom to show up.Julies apartment looks like a shrine to the mid-1960s replete with the music of the Monkees playing in the background. Paul soon discovers Julie to be even stranger than Marcy, for Julie has a shelf full with cans of Final Net hair spray and a dozen or more mousetraps around her bed. Julie asks Paul to let her draw a picture of him which he agrees.When Paul sees Tom coming back to reopen the bar, he makes a mad dash out of Julie's apartment and back to the bar. Tom tells Paul that he just left to check his apartment because it took so long for Paul to come back. Paul apologizes and gives Tom back his apartment keys. Just as Tom is about to hand over the $1.50, the phone rings and someone on the other line informs Tom that his girlfriend has just committed suicide. To his horror, Paul immediately learns that Marcy was Tom's girlfriend. Suddenly seized with the notion that Julie may follow in Marcy's suicidal footsteps, Paul leaves the bar and races back to Julie's apartment. She is fine, of course, and Paul, who desperately wants to get out of SoHo, makes a feeble excuse and leaves again.But when Paul retuns to the bar to get his apartment keys back from Tom, he finds the place closed again. Paul goes over to Tom's apartment, but he is not there either. Then the gay couple and another of Tom's neighbors see him and chase him away again. By this time, however, Tom's neighbors have become convinced that Paul is responsible for the rash of burglaries in SoHo and form together a vigilante group to hunt him down. But the real robbers are naturally Pepe and Neil, who are busy just blocks away ripping off another apartment right under everyone's nose.After going back to Kiki and Marcy's loft, Paul finds Marcy's dead body gone and yellow crime-scene tape over the entrance to the front door as the police apparently came and left with Marcy's body. Paul sees the small vigilante mob on the street armed with flashlights, baseball bats, and crowbars, and he knows they are looking for him. Paul waits until they pass by and leaves.Paul runs to Club Berlin, the nightclub where Kiki and Horst have gone, to inform them about Marcy's death. But after having trouble getting past the burly bouncer outside the club, Paul discovers that the place is a gathering of Mohawk-type punks who grab him and proceed to shave his head. Paul sees Kiki and Horst at a table and calls out to them, but they don't see or hear him through the loud music and crowd. Paul runs out of the club barely able to compose himself with only a line or two of his hair shaved off.Back on the street, Paul suddenly meets the same cab driver whom he was forced to stiff earlier for the ride. Paul gives the driver the $20 bill he took from Kiki's loft, but the driver just grabs the bill and drives off as payback for stiffing him. Paul by then has just run into another strange woman, coming out of the cab, named Gail (Catherine O'Hara) whom she feels sorry for and takes him back to her apartment.At Gail's apartment, Paul asks if he could use her phone so he can call a friend from his neighborhood for a ride. When Paul gets the number from information, Gail gleefully starts spouting out random numbers and Paul gets confused and forgets the number information has just given him. When Gail begins treating Paul's superficial wounds, she reads a newspaper article about a derelect found beaten to death the night before by an unknown mob as if she's facinated with the news. With mounting anger and frustration, Paul demands to the strange and hysterical Gail to leave him alone. Gail then blurts out that she drives a Mister Softee ice-cream truck nearby and will be glad to give him a ride home. But when they arrive at the truck parked in an alley, Gail spots a wanted poster of Paul (the same picture drawn by Julie) on a wall and uses a whistle to alert the vigilante mob which is numbering in the dozens. Paul is forced to run for his life. He gets away from the mob by running into an alley and hides atop a fire escape ladder. Then Paul witnesses a murder in the apartment just across from him where a woman shoots her abusive husband to death. I'll probably get blamed for that too, says Paul mumbling to himself.Back on the street, Paul runs into a shy homosexual man, named Alex, (Robert Plunket) and allows himself to be picked-up to let himself into the man's apartment. Paul asks to use Alex's phone to call the police and then tries to tell the desk sergeant about wanting to report the vigilante mob that's been endangering his life. Unbelievably, the police officer on the other end of the line thinks that it's a prank call and hangs up on him. Frazzled, exhausted, and running on adrenaline, Paul launches into a frenzied monologe about the events of the night to Alex. Dissolve to 30 or more minutes later, Paul ends his story with the line: I just wanted to leave my apartment, maybe meet a nice girl, and now I gotta die for it?! Then Paul sees Julie on the street putting up wanted posters of him on a lamp post. Paul runs back out onto the street and calls out to her, but she just scornfully glances at him and rides off on a bicycle. Paul sees dozens of wanted posters of him on every street corner and begins tearing them off realizing that the insane Julie has set him up to get back at him for walking out on her.At 4:10 a.m., Paul goes back to the diner where he sees Tom sitting at a table. Tom tells Paul that he just got back from the local morgue where he was forced to identify Marcy's body. Paul demands that Tom give him back his apartment keys, but Tom says that he left them back at the bar. Frantic, Paul asks Tom to hide him for there is a vigilante mob looking for him. Tom goes outside to check if the coast is clear, but Paul sees Tom running right to up Gail and the vigilante mob passing by and he tells them where Paul is. Angered at Tom's betrayal, Paul runs out of the diner just in time.As a last resort, Paul dashes back to Club Berlin hoping to find Kiki and Horst there to ask them for help, but now finds the place deserted for it is closing since the time now is almost 5 a.m. The only patron there is a middle-aged woman, named June (Verna Bloom). Paul takes the quiet time to smoke a cigarette and use the last quarter he has on him to play a song on the nightclub's jukebox. June is very sympathetic to Paul and she senses right away that he's in trouble. Paul ask June if he's like to dance with her and have a casual slow dance. When Paul hears the sounds of Gail's ice-cream truck outside and the voices of the vigilante mob (now numbering in the hundreds) Paul asks June to hide him. June lives in a basement apartment below the club and she takes Paul to her home.When Gail and the vigilante mob break into Club Berlin looking for Paul, June, who also happens to be a paper-maché sculptress, hides Paul by dumping plaster all over him and making him a living sculpture just as the mob breaks into her apartment to look for their intended victim. Unable to find Paul, Gail and her group departs. Paul then begs June to stop encasing him in paper-maché, but she continues until he is covered from head-to-toe. When June leaves to see if the coast is all clear, the two robbers, Pepe and Neil, break into June's place from a sealed manhole to rob it. When they see the sculpture with Paul encased in it, they think he is the paper-mache sculpture they lost earlier that night and steal him. They load Paul in the back of their van now spilling over with dozens of stolen appliances from the SoHo apartments including Junes (Paul realizes that under these circumstances, he will probably get blamed for robbing June's place too).As dawn breaks, Paul sits helplessly in the back of the thieves van as it rides through Manhattan on its way uptown. At a street corner, the van hits a rather large pothole, the back doors fling open, Paul comes tumbling out into the street, and the hardened paper-maché casing breaks, freeing him. Paul then looks around and sees that he's standing..... right in front of his office building! A dazed Paul dusts himself off the best he can, and enters the building just as it's opening for business.In the final shot, Paul goes to the floor where he works, sits at his desk, and goes to work at his computer while the rest of the office workers arrive as the closing credits role. It's the beginning of just another boring weekday for him.

title: The Abominable Snowman
synopsis: Titles and credits run over wide shots of the Himalayas. We open with a party on horseback approaching a Buddhist temple. Inside the courtyard some monks work as others chant in prayer. The majordomo (Anthony Chinn) announces himself and enters the Lhama's (Arnold Marle) chamber with refreshments. Dr. John Rollason (Peter Cushing) and his assistant, Peter Fox (Richard Wattis) examine some plant specimens the Lhama has provided the pair to study. The Lhama explains the plant is used to treat skin rashes. Explaining that it is the wrong time of year to collect fresh specimens, the Lhama offers his supply to Rollason. The Lhama comments on Fox, known affectionately as Foxy, not liking the tea provided. He mentions that Rollason's wife is brave to come to such a hard, rough place. The Lhama displays his ability to read people very well. Rollason volunteers that he has come to know the mountain, the people, and customs very well through climbing, but an accident caused him to give it up. Another party is six days overdue. The Lhama presses Rollason for details; He seems to sense their visit is not purely a scientific one.Foxy returns to their lab and sleeping accommodation with a plant sample. He asks Helen Rollason (Maureen Connel) for specimen jars. Foxy informs Helen he is ready to leave, So I'm ready. The sooner we get out of here, out of this infernal country with its cold, and bad smells, and the superstition. Helen also reminds him of his dislike for Tibetan tea. Foxy asks Helen to take the jars to her husband. The Lhama continues to inquire about the arriving party and specifically about a man by the name of Friend. The Lhama asks point blank, What is this man searching for? Rollason is uncomfortable and hesitates to respond, but the Lhama demands an answer and Rollason's interest. Rollason explains his interest is purely a pursuit of scientific knowledge. The Lhama predicts the arrival of Rollason's wife. He then tells Helen she will remain under his protection while her husband engages in his climbing expedition. Both Rollasons register surprise. The Lhama dismisses himself leaving John Rollason to explain his decision to his wife. She is dead set against his climbing and confronts her husband with her concerns over his obsession, with the creature. Outside the monks prepare a ceremony as the party arrives.Tom Friend (Forrest Tucker) arrives, and like the stereotypical Ugly American begins shouting at the locals and ordering his Sherpas around. Kusang (Wolfe Morris) takes the brunt of the abuse. Rollason comes out to greet Friend. Friend introduces the other members of his expedition, Ed Shelley (Robert Brown) and Andrew McNee (Michael Brill). Friend introduces McNee as Jacques. Helen invites all to join them for dinner of stew. Ed Shelley tells all that will listen, I don't know what's worse about it? The stink of everything or the ignorant natives or the filthy food they eat or what. You tell me. When Shelley finally gets to the heart of the matter--the Abominable Snowman, Helen informs him, It doesn't exist. McNee tells the assembled that he saw their footprints on a prior expedition. Friend shows Rollason a silver container housing a tooth. He believes it is a Yeti tooth. The silver cylinder had been stolen from the monastery some time earlier. Friend intends to return it to the Lhama. Outside the monks start their ceremonial dance. Friend explains his climbing plan and it includes no porters, just the five men. Friend invites Rollason along for his expertise. Rollason, Helen and Friend go to see the Lhama with the tooth. The Lhama explains the tooth was carved and that the Yeti is imaginary. The Lhama warns Rollason that he expects only good intentions on his involvement. Rollason doesn't fully understand or appreciate the advise.The next morning the party departs. Before they leave, Helen makes one last attempt to dissuade her husband, It's those men, Friend and Shelley. I don't trust them and I don't like them. The party sets off and notices three men shadowing them. It is apparent McNee is in no shape for the climb and the three men are definitely following them. Then shots ring out and Kusang is convinced, These men bandits. They kill us. Rollason sees their faces through his binoculars as Shelley scares them away with gun shots of his own. Rollason recognizes the men from the monastery but tells Friend otherwise. They continue their climb up to the hut and provisions placed there earlier. They eat and discuss their plans. Friend asks Rollason for his expert advise, such as what they live on. Rollason tells him, Small animals, hares, mice, voles...roots and plants under the snow. Friend finally explains the real purpose of their expedition. He intends to capture a creature, alive if possible. McNee senses something outside. They exit the hut to see, but it is late. They bed down for the night. Rollason and Friend go back outside for a smoke and to talk. Friend tells Rollason his interest is commercial and he intends to both learn and profit from his expedition.At the monastery, the Friend Expedition porters pester Helen and Foxy for their money. Friend refused to pay them until he returned. Helen is convinced the party is doomed. Foxy goes to talk to the Lhama, but he is in deep meditation and ignores Foxy. Rollason digs up a highly nutritious species of moss, confirming his theory about how the creatures manage to survive in such a harsh environment. McNee volunteers he doesn't trust Tom Friend and observes Rollason doesn't either. Rollason asks why he came. McNee explains the obsession with finding the creatures and that he paid Friend to join the expedition. It is now apparent that McNee is dangerously unsuited for the trek. McNee walks into a spring trap. Rollason tries to free him, but the arrival of Shelley, who set the trap, is able to free McNee's leg. Shelley explains they have already caught a Yeti. They help McNee back to camp. Kusang and Friend show Rollason their Yeti, but Rollason explains it is a Himalayan monkey. Rollason does his best to treat McNee's leg. A weather report on their portable radio indicates a blizzard coming in twenty-four hours. Rollason accuses Friend, You're nothing but a cheap fairground trickster. They scuffle and damage the radio and any future weather reports. A commotion outside, brings them all to investigate. They find the monkey is gone and the cage door torn off its hinges. They see sixteen inch long footprints in the snow. Back in the tent McNee sees a hand of the creature exploring inside. Kusang's screams brings the party to the tent. Kusang bolts the encampment and runs back to the monastery. Friend notices that the traps they set earlier are torn apart. McNee stirs in pain, despite narcotics administered by Rollason. McNee falls back to sleep after Shelley shoots and kills one of the creatures. They follow a bloody trail back to the body lying in the snow. Friend pronounces the find as dead, and at least eleven feet tall.At the monastery, Kusang arrives exhausted and still frightened. Helen witnesses his arrival and tells Foxy. Helen goes to see the Lhama, but gets lost in the building. She explains to the Lhama she saw Kusang and the Lhama confirms only that her husband is in danger but he can do nothing. Foxy takes her back to their quarters. Helen proposes to go find her husband by engaging the porters. They were not paid by Friend, so she pays them with her own funds.McNee is better the next day. Rollason tells him they are moving to the cave and they have a dead creature. They hear the cries of something echoing in the mountains. McNee is strangely drawn to the calls and walks away from camp. He falls from a cliff and is killed. Friend believes the creatures killed McNee. It was the sound of that howling. He couldn't stand it; It drove him mad, Friend accuses. Several reports from Shelley's rifle brings Rollason and Friend running back to the cave. Shelley is hysterical. He recounts that two very large creatures ran towards him. He is convinced they are after him personally because he killed their comrade. Friend proposes to set a trap in the cave and use Shelley as bait for the creatures. Shelley reluctantly agrees to the plan. Rollason returns to McNee to bury the body. Helen, Foxy and the porters walk up the mountain in search of her husband. Friend explains to Rollason that the tungsten steel net will stop anything. He gives Shelley a cleaned and loaded weapon, but since he wants it alive and Shelley is far too trigger happy, he actually gives him a gun loaded with dummy ammunition. Rollason and Friend return to the tent. A blizzard kicks up and Friend can barely see the cave from the tent. Rollason tries to convince Friend to be satisfied with a dead Yeti, but Friend is adamant--he will settle for nothing less than a live specimen. The creatures spring the trap, and as expected, Shelley fires at them. Rollason and Friend notice the net torn to pieces and Shelley is dead. Rollason attributes the death to a heart attack from fright. He also notices the dummy ammunition. The Yeti came for their dead comrade but left without it.Rollason and Friend bury Shelley next to Andrew McNee. They return to the cave to wait out the storm. Rollason proposes that the Yeti can read their minds, and that they may be just waiting for humans to go extinct to take their place in the world. The cold, altitude, and exhaustion cause them to hallucinate. Rollason hears a weather report on the broken radio. Rollason begins to panic and is cured with oxygen. Next Friend begins to hear calls for help from Shelley. Friend overpowers Rollason and exits the cave to search for Ed Shelley. Revolver shots by Friend start an avalanche that buries him alive. Rollason searches for Friend but finds no trace, and returns to the cave. He sees two creatures inside the back of the cave. One approaches and stares at Rollason.Helen is awakened by the distant howls of the creatures. She exits the hut to get a bearing on the sounds. Foxy wakes and sees that Helen has gone and sets out to search for her. He quickly returns and rousts the porters to join him on the search. Helen finds her husband nearly dead in the snow and large footprints near his body. They return to the Monastery and the Lhama consoles Rollason. To keep their secret and the only chance to keep them alive, Rollason lies and tells the Lhama they don't exist. There is no Yeti, are the final words uttered by the Lhama. We close with a panoramic shot of the mountains.

title: Threads
synopsis: It is March, 1984. In Sheffield, England, young Ruth Beckett & Jimmy Kemp are out in the country above Sheffield when a U.S. F-4 Phantom flies past overhead from the nearby R.A.F. Finningley base. Sheffield, the 4th-largest city in Britain, is close to a prominent R.A.F. Base and also has a major component of steel, energy & chemical production. Jimmy flicks through the car's radio stations, missing a brief news story about a Soviet invasion of Iran in his attempt to find the broadcast of the latest football game. Ruth chastises him for his lack of taste, but after he gets out of the car & comes back with a flower the two start to kiss.Later that week, the BBC runs a story about a Soviet convoy moving through northern Iran. The convoys had apparently been spotted by U.S. satellites, traversing 3 of the mountain passes leading from the USSR. The story goes on to say the Soviet foreign minister had defiantly defended the invasion, and it soon becomes obvious that the Soviets are hoping to convert Iran to yet another Soviet satellite state. During this time frame Ruth also reveals to Jimmy she is pregnant, and wants to keep the baby. When Jimmy informs his parents his father reacts somewhat harshly; his mother tries to point out all the options available to them. Jimmy informs his parents that he & Ruth plan to get married and have the child. Jimmy works for a carpentry firm; it is not clear what Ruth works as. Michael, Jimmy's annoying younger brother, humiliates him in front of his sister Alison by mentioning the upcoming pregnancy, which provokes an angry reaction from both Jimmy and his mother.Soon after, the U.S. states it will send troops to Iran if the USSR doesn't cease its invasion. The Soviets apparently ignore the warning, and soon after U.S. paratroops go in near the Soviet base at Moshad in northern Iran. Hoping the USSR will back off, the British prime minister issues a statement of support for the U.S. action. Unfortunately the USSR ignores the international condemnation, and as Ruth & Jimmy's parents meet to discuss the upcoming wedding/pregnancy, a story is broadcast by the BBC advising that a U.S. submarine has disappeared while on reconnaissance duty. Days later, young Alison Kemp is doing homework when a story appears on the BBC - debris from a missing U.S. submarine has been found, apparently sunk by the Soviets. The U.S. President angrily denounces the Soviets' unprovoked attack against the submarine, as well as its invasion of Iran. He goes on to warn the Soviets that their leadership risks escalating things to the point of nuclear war.As the crisis escalates, Jimmy & Ruth pay little attention to it, focusing instead on finding an apartment and getting it ready to move in. Visiting his dad after work one day, Jimmy notices an F-4 flying past overhead from Finningley, and his father remarks, 'There's something going on, I'm telling you'. While at a bar that night, Jimmy and a young lady meet up and are happened upon by an Army convoy while making out in Jimmy's car.May, 1984: The United States issues an ultimatum to the USSR calling for joint withdrawal of all U.S. & Soviet forces from Iran. The Soviets arrogantly ignore it, and as U.K. residents pray for peace, the U.S. launches a conventional weapons strike against the Soviets' Moshad base, using high-level B-52 bombers. The USSR defends the base with a nuclear-tipped air-defence missile, annihilating the bombers. The U.S. retaliates with a single, low-yield tactical nuclear weapon on the Soviet base, and the exchange stops - for now.Anti-Soviet demonstrations are taking place in both the U.S. and East Germany, and people in cities such as Sheffield are heading for Wales, west England, and other country towns well away from major areas to avoid being caught in a possible nuclear war. The Kemps' neighbors, the Stothards, are among these. Leaving in their Peugeot station wagon, its roof & seats piled with belongings, the Stothards, their daughter, and dog find themselves caught up in the major influx of people heading for remote towns. Stopped by police on an 'essential service route', they are directed to the M1 where single-lane traffic is being allowed to proceed. Mr. Stothard takes the officer's suggestion and carries on to his relatives using this route.Sheffield's peacetime chief executive, Mr. Sutton, is also being advised of changes that need to be made to prepare for the possibility of attack. If necessary, the chief executive can be given full powers of internal government. He is advised to summon the pre-determined emergency committee, which he does. Some changes are already being made; key points are being guarded, known/potential; subversives are arrested, and the government is requisitioning raw materials for possible wartime use. As riots break out in the U.K as well, the government starts to reinforce Europe by taking control of British Airways and cross-channel ferries, leaving thousands of travelers stranded. The Royal Navy also moves in to guard the oil rigs of the North Sea. More disturbing, the U.S. aircraft carrier 'Kittyhawk' is sunk by a Soviet sub, and the U.S. begins an air & naval blockade of Cuba. Further riots in East Germany occur. The Sheffield emergency committee is summoned to the fallout shelter below the city hall.Hospitals are also cleared for expected casualties; Mr. Beckett's elderly mother is sent home to live with them. Art galleries are also cleared & the paintings put into storage (possibly the galleries were to be used as fallout shelters). 'Protect & Survive' PSAs are broadcast on U.K. TV & radio, and books outlining precautions to be taken are being delivered to U.K. residents. Ruth & Jimmy are removing wallpaper in their apartment one night when one of these PSAs comes on, and Ruth is so frightened she starts to cry. As Jimmy looks out their apartment window, the fire engines from the nearby hall are deployed to a safe location in an underground bunker - a sign that things are definitely worsening.May 26, 1984. Ruth's morning sickness has her in its grip, and her mother goes to call her employer to tell them Ruth won't be in. However, when she does, she discovers the phone line is dead. This is the U.K's Preferential Telephone System in use; non-essential phones are disconnected, leaving the lines open for emergency communications among government/civic officials only. The Kemps are trying to build a fallout shelter; young Alison is sent by her mother to buy canned/dry food - it is the last we see of her. At 8:30 a.m. people are going about their business, and the emergency committee is meeting in the bunker. Suddenly an alarm goes off from the UKWMO, followed by the chilling words, 'ATTACK WARNING! RED! ATTACK WARNING! RED!'. The committee immediately recognizes what it means; the USSR has decided to launch an ICBM attack against the UK, in retaliation for trying to stop the Iran invasion and its failure to support Soviet ambitions. NASA Space Command detected Soviet ICBMs in-flight minutes after launch, and the UKWMO also picked up the signal. Outside, Jimmy & co-worker Bob are arguing with people wanting to buy boards for fallout shelters, when the attack warning siren begins to wail - a long, wavering, incessant tone. Jimmy & Bob dive under their truck, and other people desperately try to find shelter before the attack hits. The first warhead explodes above the North Sea, causing the EMP - electromagnetic pulse - effect, crippling electronics & communications equipment. At R.A.F. Finningley, the U.S. F-4s stationed there desperately start to launch along with R.A.F. aircraft. Although they manage to get fighters into the air, at 8:37 the first tactical missile salvo hits most NATO military targets, including Finningley. The mushroom cloud bursts & looms high over the R.A.F. base, and the terrified residents of Sheffield see it. The blast wave hits seconds later, causing significant damage. Jimmy & Bob emerge from under the truck to see the horrifying cloud in the distance. Bob whispers, 'Jesus Christ, Jimmy.....they've done it!'. Jimmy attempts to head to Ruth's but finding his car disabled, he heads out on foot. As panic-stricken residents of Sheffield run for shelter, Mr. & Mrs Kemp, caught unawares, desperately try to improvise a lean-to as detailed in the survival information. The Becketts escape to their cellar, which is well fortified. The initial exchange results in 80 MT falling on the UK; as exchanges escalate, all major cities in the UK and U.S.A. become targets. Now, strategic rather than tactical weapons will be used. The total East-West exchange is 3000 MT; 210 of these fall on the UK alone. Sheffield, being a major industrial center, also becomes a target. A 1-MT ICBM hits near Crewe, annihilating most of Sheffield. Most of the population is destroyed along with the city; immediately after, firestorms rage through the city. With radioactive fallout imminent, firefighting & rescue attempts are unlikely for some time. With many roofs blown open as well, the survivors are especially vulnerable to the deadly radiation.The Kemps, badly wounded after being caught off guard, stumble out of their lean-to into a horrifying scene; everything is ablaze with fire. They find the body of their youngest son Michael under rubble in the back garden. Mrs. Kemp is horribly burned from fire; Mr. Kemp is suffering radiation sickness within hours. In the Becketts' basement, Ruth, her parents & grandmother are having a difficult time; Ruth is overcome with anguish at Jimmy's likely death (he was caught outside when the warhead hit) and is seemingly numb to what's going on. Several days after the attack, she flees into the street as her parents drag her grandmother's body upstairs (she had died in her sleep). As Ruth leaves her house for the outside, she enters a world she doesn't know. The fires are out, but nothing is recognizable. Death is everywhere; Ruth sees hands/feet/bodies extruding from rubble; she encounters a horribly burned mother with a dead baby; she also sees a man extracting relatively intact Star Wars figures from the rubble & placing them gently on a burned piece of wood. Overcome with grief, Ruth disappears into the streets.Not long after Ruth leaves, Mr. & Mrs. Beckett find their home invaded by looters, who kill them. Food stocks are now controlled by the central government; no food distribution is likely until 2 weeks after the attack. This results in food riots, in which some people are killed or injured. Mrs. Kemp dies of the injuries suffered in the blast; her body is discovered by Ruth a few weeks after the attack. Mr. Kemp dies several months after of radiation poisoning - ironically, he dies in a cemetery.In Buxton, 20 mile from Sheffield, Ruth enters a hospital that is filled wall-to-wall with people. With little in the way of medical supplies, doctors & nurses are forced to resort to primitive, sometimes horrible measures, to save lives - such as sawing off infected limbs without benefit of an anesthetic!Months after the attack, Ruth finally gives birth to a baby girl - alone, with no medical support. Miraculously (?), the baby appears healthy. She is named Jane.The people under the city hall, in the bunker, are buried alive; with no heavy equipment available and fallout danger high, it is weeks before they can be reached. By the time a rescue team digs through to them, they have all died of suffocation.Collecting the first harvest is a matter of life & death after the attack; however, it is difficult to grow crops with radiated soil, no agrochemicals or fertilizers, and the crops are highly vulnerable to disease, viruses & insects. In the first few years, most of the very young & very old die due to extreme cold caused by the smoke & dust lifted into the atmosphere, shutting out the sun's heat & light.Years later, the returning sun is now heavier with UV light, causing a higher rate of cancers/leukemias, also caused by the lethal gamma radiation. Ruth runs into Jimmy's old friend Bob, and the two are reluctantly forced to butcher a dead sheep in order to survive. Ruth fears the sheep likely died of radiation, as cold doesn't usually kill sheep. Ultimately, she gives in to Bob's suggestion.13 years after the attack: Ruth, working alongside her daughter in the fields, collapses. She later succumbs to the insidious radiation-induced leukemia with Jane at her side. Jane, helpless, can only use the words, 'up', and 'work', as well as her mother's name. It appears that children born post-war cannot even learn the basic language skills.Jane, forced to survive on her own now, falls in with a pair of young men who are looters. Special courts have wide-ranging powers of justice; the killers of Ruth's parents are found & executed by firing squad. The army also has the authority to shoot looters on sight; this is the fate that meets one of the boys Jane falls in with.Christmas Day, 13 years after: Jane is raped (off-screen) by 2 men; we see her several months later in a building that looks much like a hostel. Jane tells the woman working there, 'Babby's coming!'. She is told to go elsewhere, but after repeating herself several times she is assigned to a bed. She gives birth to a horribly deformed, stillborn infant. As it is passed to her, she looks at it, and opens her mouth to scream, but the audience hears nothing but the howling wind. Silence follows as the credits scroll across the screen.

title: The Alligator People
synopsis: The movie opens with title and credits shown over a scene of a mangrove swamp. A Chrysler Imperial with Louisiana MD license plates pulls into a parking lot. It is the Doctors Only lot of the Webley Sanitarium. Doctor Eric Lorimer (Bruce Bennett) exits his car and enters the office of Dr. Wayne MacGregor (Douglas Kennedy). MacGregor is a neuropathologist. Eric is joining Wayne as a consultant on an interesting case. The case involves a nurse, Jane Marvin. Wayne explains, That's the name she's using. Wayne is conducting research in narco-hypnosis techniques. Wayne calls his nurse to come into the office. Wayne introduces his nurse, Jane Marvin, aka Joyce Webster (Beverly Garland) to Eric Lorimer. Jane rests on the couch and Wayne injects her with a mild sedative and asks her to count backwards. The Pentothal acts quickly. In addition to a tape recorder, Wayne has a polygraph, or lie detector, set up to record the session. Wayne asks her name, and she replies, Joyce Hatten...Joyce Hatten Webster. When he asks her if she is married she admits, I was. I was Mrs. Paul Webster. Then she admits she is not sure. Wayne asks her to tell them her story. She starts by saying, I met Paul overseas. He was a lieutenant. I was nursing in a hospital. We made plans to be married after we were both discharged. The tale is told in flashback.On a moving train, Joyce and her new husband, Paul Webster (Richard Crane) are sitting in a sleeping car. A train Porter (an uncredited Dudley Dickerson) opens a bottle of champagne and pours it into two glasses. Paul tips the Porter before he leaves and the happy couple share a kiss. Paul admits he was in an aircraft accident, but dismisses stories of how serious it was. Joyce tells him, You wouldn't believe what that hospital doctor told me when I called. Well, according to him, you were more dead than alive. Almost every bone broken: completely torn, mangled, smashed. She notes that he has no marks or scars, therefore it couldn't have been that serious. Paul admits it was serious. He screws up enough courage to tell her the truth about why he waited so long to tell her the story. The Porter returns with telegrams of congratulations. Paul reads one telegram and is visibly upset. He folds it up and then exits the cabin. He asks the conductor (an uncredited Hal K. Dawson), When's the next stop? The next stop is in 35 minutes, but a very short mail pickup stop is coming up right now. Paul needs a telephone, but the conductor advises against leaving the train. It is a 30 second stop. Paul refuses to tell Joyce what is bothering him. The train pulls away and Joyce is frantic.We are back in Dr. MacGregor's office and Joyce is still telling her story under hypnosis. She tells the doctors she got off at the next stop and went back to the platform, but there was no sign of Paul. She talked to his friends and checked prior addresses. She spoke to police, hired private detectives, and spoke to the Army. Since Paul had never mentioned family she had no clues. Months later she contacted his college, via his fraternity. It was Louisiana State University, and the only address, when he enrolled, was in Bayou Landing, a place called the Cypresses. She went on the train and was the only person at the station. There was a large crate on the platform addressed to the Cypresses that had a large label indicating the contents: Cobalt-60. She sat on the crate waiting for someone to pick it up. A scruffy gentleman with a hook hand drove up and told her he was driving out to the Cypresses. Manon (Lon Chaney, Jr.) had come for the crate and invited Joyce for a ride back to the plantation house. Manon stops to clear a fallen branch that is blocking their path. Joyce witnesses two men wrestling an alligator in the swamp. She is visibly disturbed by the sight. Manon hates gators, and tells Joyce, Dirty, nasty, slimy gators. A large one crosses the road in their path and Manon deliberately runs over the creature. He shows her his hook hand and explains a gator took it off. She exits the truck at the front door and knocks. The butler, Toby (an uncredited Vince Townsend, Jr.) answers the door. Mrs. Lavinia 'Vinnie' Hawthorne (Frieda Inescort) descends the stairs with a cane in hand. Lavinia directs the butler to admit Joyce into the house. Joyce tells Vinnie her story of her search for her husband. When Joyce tells the older woman her name, Mrs. Paul Webster, Vinnie tries to stifle a surprised response. Vinnie then accuses Joyce of playing some game and making up a story. She introduces herself as Mrs. Henry Hawthorne, a widow, and then asks her to leave at once. Toby reminds his boss that the next train is tomorrow. Vinnie reluctantly agrees to put Joyce up for the night. She tells the maid, Louann (an uncredited Ruby Goodwin) to show the lady to the guest room upstairs. Vinnie insists Joyce not leave her room under any circumstances.That evening, Joyce hears shots being fired outside. Vinnie orders Toby to tell Manon to stop shooting at the gators. That is when Joyce realizes she has been locked in her room. Down in the swamp, a very drunk Manon screams and shoots at the alligators. Louann will not give Joyce any information, but warns her to leave as soon as possible. The phone rings and Vinnie answers. It is Dr. Mark Sinclair (George Macready) calling. He stands next to a very large alligator strapped down to a table. Vinnie tells Mark, She's here, Mark. Paul's wife. She tells the doctor shell be right over and they can decide what to do about this complication. Joyce watches Lavinia drive off in the station wagon. Vinnie drives up to the house Sinclair is using as a lab and hospital. A figure in a bathrobe struggles with three male nurses (uncredited: John Frederick, Ken Kane and Lee Warren). Dr. Sinclair enters the room as the nurses manage to get the patient under control and back to bed. We see the doctor inject the patient in the arm. The skin is reptilian in texture. Vinnie enters the lab and calls out to Mark. He explains that he had an emergency with number six (an uncredited Bill Bradley). Apparently Sinclair and Vinnie were not successful in covering all references to Paul. Sinclair explains he needs more time to test before he can proceed. Mark promises to stop in the morning and talk to Joyce.Paul, dressed in a trench coat, enters the plantation house. Joyce is upstairs in her room. She managed to steal the key from Louann earlier. She hears the piano being played downstairs and goes to investigate. She quietly enters the darkened room and sees the face of the man playing the piano. His face has a reptilian texture. Paul runs from the room leaving very strange footprints. Vinnie drives back to the house and Paul stops her on the path and demands, What's she doing here? They both agree she must leave the next morning.The next morning Dr. Sinclair drives his swamp buggy to the plantation house. Joyce is pacing outside on the porch. He introduces himself and waxes philosophical about the swamp. Joyce introduces herself as Mrs. Paul Webster, then carefully examines the doctor's face for any sign of surprise or recognition. He feigns ignorance, but Joyce calls him on it. Mark Sinclair departs. One of the nurses unpacks the Cobalt-60 and loads it into the X-Ray machine. At the house, Joyce looks through Vinnie's desk. Vinnie catches her and demands to know why Joyce abuses her hospitality. Joyce tells Vinnie, I'm not leaving here until I get the answers to the questions that brought me here. Joyce bluntly accuses her hostess of lying to her. Vinnie finally admits that she is Paul's mother.Paul returns to the house. He enters and goes to the parlor to talk to his mother. He asks his mother if Joyce has gone, but Joyce gets up from the chair that hid her face, and responds, No, Paul, she hasn't. Paul what is it? What happened? Paul runs from the house, and Joyce chases him into the swamp. She calls to her husband, and Manon hears her calls and goes out after her. Manon rescues her and takes her to his cabin. He gets her a glass of moonshine, and then tries to take advantage of her. She screams and he slugs her, knocking her out. Paul enters the cabin and sees Manon starting to undress his wife. He attacks the drunk. Paul carries his unconscious wife back to the plantation house. Manon comes to and vows, I'll kill you, alligator man! Just like I'd kill any four-legged gator!Toby and Louann take Joyce upstairs to the guest room. Vinnie tells Paul they can't keep the secret any longer. Paul is becoming despondent over his condition but his mother is hopeful. Paul goes back to the lab and talks to Mark. Mark confirms the Cobalt-60 arrived, but any treatment using the radioactive element is months away. Paul insists the treatment begin immediately. X-ray combined with Gamma radiation has the chance of a complete recovery, but Mark argues, And it might kill you! Mark relents, and agrees he will proceed the next night. Mark informs Paul he will tell Joyce the whole story in the morning.Joyce goes to see Dr. Sinclair the next morning. An alligator is strapped down on the X-Ray machine and Mark exposes it to the treatment. The gator hisses during the exposure. Joyce tells Dr. Sinclair she is a nurse. Mark explains his research on hormones, specifically with hydrocortisone. He notes that some lizards can grow a new tail, or replace an entire limb if lost. His research was financed by Vinnie and alligator extracts were used on dying men and women. The recovery was remarkable, but there was a side effect. Patient number six presents with an emergency, so Mark invites Joyce to witness the side effect first hand. She sees Patient Number Six with the skin texture of an alligator. The man is suffering brain damage and responds to a sun lamp, As a depressant on reptiles, it makes them lethargic, dormant. Joyce finally realizes what her husband is becoming: an alligator. Mark tells Joyce that Paul will be treated tonight. Joyce insists on seeing Paul and witnessing the treatment. That evening Paul arrives at the lab, and Joyce confronts him. He reluctantly agrees to discuss his condition. Vinnie and Mark arrive and preparation for the treatment begins. Joyce begins to cry and Vinnie comforts her. Vinnie admits, I'm sorry for the way I treated you. Paul was so desperate to keep you from knowing. We did everything we could.A drunk Manon enters the main house with a gun. He demands to know where Paul is located. Toby convinces him Paul is not in the house. Manon concludes he must be in the lab and leaves the plantation house. In the lab, Paul is strapped to the X-Ray table. The exposure interval is 30 seconds, no more or it could be lethal. Mark tells Paul to relax and keep his eyes closed. Treatment begins and Mark times it with a stop watch. Manon breaks into the lab demanding to see Paul. One of the male nurses and Vinnie demand he leave. Manon enters the shielded area and knocks Dr. Mark Sinclair out while the treatment is under way. The machinery begins to overheat and the exposure lasts too long. Manon sees a man on the table with the head of an alligator. Manon is disappointed his quarry is not there, No, you ain't him. Paul hops off the table and growls at Manon. Manon snags his hook in the X-Ray machine cables and is electrocuted. Paul exits the X-Ray room and faces his wife and mother. Joyce screams and Vinnie faints. Paul runs out of the lab and into the swamp. Joyce chases after her husband calling his name. Mark comes to just as the lab explodes. Paul sees his reflection in the water of the swamp. He wades into the water and attacks an alligator. Joyce follows and witnesses the struggle. Paul falls into quicksand and is pulled under to his death. She screams and we return to MacGregor's office.Wayne turns off the tape recorder and asks Eric what he thinks of the story. Aspects of her story check out. The problem the doctor faces is that Jane has suppressed the story and lives a happy life. So, what to do? Let her listen to the painful story or just leave well enough alone? Jane enters the office and tells her boss she is going off duty. Wayne and Eric decide not to tell Jane/Joyce. We close with a shot of the tape recorder running.

title: Rocky Balboa
synopsis: In the past 15 years (1990-2005) since the end of the last Rocky movie, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stalone) is a retired boxer who owns an Italian themed restaurant in Philadelphia named after his beloved wife Adrian (flashbacks to the original portrayal by Talia Shire), who passed away from ovarian cancer in 2002. He visits her gravesite regularly, and takes a tour of notable landmarks in Philadelphia that remind him of their time together. Their only son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), has entered the corporate world and works at a firm in downtown Philadelphia. The relationship between father and son is strained; Robert feels resentment about living in the shadow of his famous father.Rocky still sees his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young) on a regular basis. He begrudgingly joins Rocky on the tour of his life with Adrian, but it pains him to do so because he knows he did not treat his sister very well. Rocky reminds him that Adrian loved him too. At the end of his yearly tour, he stops at the Lucky Seven tavern, which he would pass by on his way to Mickey's gym during his boxing career. The bartender is Marie, a grown woman Rocky hadn't seen in decades. Back in 1975 during the first Rocky movie, she was a young teenager who Rocky admonished her to quit smoking and clean up her act. Now, she is a down-on-her-luck bartender and single mother of a (presumably) teenage child named Stephenson (or Steps, his nickname). Partly out of a desire to help her, as he did before, and partly out of the need for a friend and confidant, Rocky befriends Marie and tries to provide a role model for Steps. When his assistant at the restaurant goes on maternity leave, he invites Marie to work there as the hostess and barmaid.The sense of stagnation that has gripped Rocky since Adrian's death begins to lift when ESPN televises a computer simulation of a fight on a television program hosted by Brian Kenny. The virtual fight pits Rocky (in his prime) against the current Heavyweight champion, Mason The Line Dixon (Antonio Tarver). The simulation causes a change of heart in Rocky; though he has not fought professionally in years, he begins to believe he still has some stuff in the basement, and and that he has a beast inside that needs to be released he decides to start fighting again, but only on a small scale.Rocky goes to Robert and Paulie to ask them to be in his corner and to help him train. Robert feels that the whole notion is crazy and that the feelings his father is having will soon pass. Paulie also thinks the idea is crazy and tells Rocky the reason for these feelings is because Adrian left him. Rocky sharply corrects Paulie by saying She didn't leave me, she died. In an emotional scene, Rocky breaks down and admits that he has found life without Adrian unbearable and much harder than he thought it would be. As a result of that, a beast has grown inside him and it is tearing him apart. Rocky needs an outlet to vent his anger and pain. Paulie wishes to help Rocky but all he has time for is his work at the meat plant and cannot afford to help.Rocky applies for his license to fight and although he passes all of his medical tests he is still refused a license beacuse of his age. After an impassioned speech to the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission, in which he accuses them of acting in bad faith by knowing full well that they will deny him a licence even if he passes, he is allowed back into the ring.The simulation, and the news that Rocky has gotten his license, gets gears turning in Mason Dixon's camp. Dixon is viewed as soft because he hasn't had any true competition - all of his opponents have provided him little challenge, and generated scant interest from the public. Dixon's promoters inform him that HBO won't televise any more of his fights because they don't make any money; most of the available challengers have little marquee value. They convince him to participate in an exhibition bout against Rocky, to take advantage of the buzz generated by the computer fight. At first, Dixon refuses: he has no desire to beat an old man. But he realizes that, if he is ever to respect himself as a fighter, he needs to test himself against a true challenger.Dixon's representatives come to see Rocky in his restaurant and offer him the chance to face Dixon in the ring in a charity exhibition bout. At first, Rocky is unsure - this is far bigger than what he was planning to do - but Marie advises him to take this last shot. Paulie doesn't believe it is possible, but when he is fired from the meat plant, he comes back to Rocky and, in a drunken rant, pledges to help him. Robert is harder to convince: though he is his own man, he has resented living in the shadow of his father, and though he knows his father doesn't mean for it to happen, the notion of a new fight threatens to make it worse. For both their sakes, Robert begs Rocky to not fight. Rocky answers his son with one of the more inspiring lines of dialogue in the film:Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!Robert understands and quits his job to join Rocky in his corner. Tony Duke Evers is once again his head trainer, and gears his training specifically toward his ability to generate power.Rocky's age (he is 58) precludes him from training for speed, and sparring will not help him any, drawing on Rocky's experience and ring smarts. Duke's strategy is to start buildin' some hurtin' bombs; in other words, try to beat Dixon with brute strength and put him away early in the fight before Rocky's stamina gives out. After a grueling training montage mirroring many elements of that seen in the first film, Rocky is ready for the ring.The Balboa-Dixon exhibition match is broadcast over HBO Pay-per-view from the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino in Las Vegas. The two respective fighters enter the ring to their own respective themes - Rocky enters to the tune of Frank Sinatra singing High Hopes (Paulie's selection) while Dixon enters to an agressive number--It's a Fight by Three 6 Mafia. Celebrated sports announcer Michael Buffer opens the event with his usual flair, including his trademarked catchprase, Let's get ready to rumble! The fight itself starts slowly - Rocky is thrown off balance by Dixon's speed. He does land a few punches in the first round, but it is in the second round that Rocky starts to do some damage. After Rocky is knocked down twice by Dixon, a hook to Rocky's body breaks Dixon's left hand, and allows Rocky to charge in and throw some devastating punches.The fight is back and forth, until the tenth (and final) round when it appears that Dixon will outlast the tired Balboa. A hook sends Balboa to a knee where he has a flashback, and within his head he returns to what he said to his son when asked not to fight again:What is it you said to the kid? It ain't about how hard you can hit; it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward...How much you can take and keep moving forward. Now get up, get up!In this Rocky finds the strength to continue; he stands up, and Dixon is visibly stunned at the aged former champion's determination. Rocky fights back, throwing punch after punch. Balboa taunts Dixon to get him to give everything he has, knowing this is the last round of his life. The fight ends with both fighters trading blows in the center of the ring, and it is Rocky that throws the last punch of the fight, knocking Dixon to the ropes as the bell rings, singling the end of the fight. The spectators cheer wildly. Rocky tells Paulie that the beast that was living inside him is now gone. Rocky exits the arena as the decision is read; Dixon wins in a split decision. Rocky, who has already begun leaving the ring, turns back to the crowd, taking one more curtain call before finally leaving, as the crowd roars their approval. The final scene is a frozen screen of Rocky holding a fan's hand as he walks into the tunnel.The movie concludes as it began, with Rocky at Adrian's grave. He leaves a flower for Adrian, saying, Yo, Adrian, we did it, a reprise of when he said Yo, Adrian, I did it! when he won the title in 1976 in Rocky II. Then he turns and walks away, stopping for a moment to turn once more to the gravesite and wave, before fading from focus altogether, seeming as if he asends. The last shot of the film, and of the saga as a whole, is of the flower on the headstone.During the end credits, there is an acknowledgement of the iconic status the Rocky series has achieved, through a montage of people following in Rocky's footsteps, charging up the front steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, concluding with a reprise of the famous stair sequence from the original film. The credits fade to black from a still shot of Rocky standing in silhouette at the top of the steps, facing the skyline of Philadelphia as night falls.

title: 25th Hour
synopsis: FLASHBACK: The movie begins as Montgomery Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) is driving in NYC with Kostya (Tony Siraguza), his Russian/Ukranian mobster-type muscle. Kostya has a heavy accent and some trouble with English idioms. He references Doyle's Law rather than Murphy's Law. They're late to meet with some important people. They find a badly injured dog that was obviously abandoned after a dogfight, and Monty wants to first shoot the dog with Kostya's gun (as a mercy killing) and then when he sees what a scrapper the pup is, he decides to save the dog. He grabs it in his jacket, and sticks it in his trunk, and though the dog bites him, he's very impressed with that fighting spirit. They drive on.PRESENT: Monty is sitting at the pier with the dog, whom he named Doyle. It's early morning; people are jogging. A strung out junkie comes to Monty begging for a fix, and Monty tells him to go to Harlem, because he's been touched and is out of the business. The junkie just doesn't seem to get it, says he's been coming to Monty for 5 years and that he'll remember this! He lurches off, and Monty wanders away with Doyle.Monty and Doyle walk along the streets of NYC, and end up on the campus of what looks like a private prep school. Monty stands looking at a display of sports trophies and old photos, til a school administrator confronts him and tells him to leave with the dog. He tells her that he used to go to this school, and was on the basketball team, was doing well til he was kicked out of the school for fighting. She thaws a little bit as he shows her himself in the photo and says he held some big record. She tells him that record was broken just last year, and she knows because she coaches the girls' team. He's a little taken aback/wistful. He asks if she could help him find Jake Elinsky, his friend.In a classroom, Jakob Jake Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is teaching his poetry class. The chairs are all arranged in a circle and Mary (Anna Paquin) who is dressed very provocatively, and has a giant henna tattoo on her stomach, is reading a poem out loud.The rest of the class seems like they're completely dead/disinterested. Just then, Monty shows up at the door and briefly talks to Jake. He tells him to get in touch with Frank and that they can't meet for dinner because he has to go see his dad. That they should meet afterwards at a bar and then there's a going away party for him that night at the Bridge club. He notes that Mary is hot and that she's giving him the eye. He leaves and the bell rings; the students all scatter.Then I'm not quite sure I remember the exact order that this all happens in the next section, but basically all these things happen.* We see a busy stock/bond exchange type room. Francis Frank Xavier Slattery (Barry Pepper) gets the call from Jake. He can't talk though, and hangs up. Frank's boss comes and yells at him that he needs to sell off some stocks/bonds. It's obvious that Frank has a very high pressure job and deals with a lot of money, but is on top of it all. He doesn't do what the boss asks and fights with some underlings. It looks like he was right not to sell the bonds, however.* Back at the school, Mary comes to see Jake in the teacher's lounge. He asks about her henna tattoo and she implies that her mother doesn't really care what she does. Mary argues about the unfair B- grade that he gave her on her last assignment, saying she needs better grades to get into college. She's pissed he gave another student an A+ for a story about his dead grandmother, but the night before the funeral, that guy was getting drunk at a basketball party and slapping girls' asses. Jake says that it's sometimes difficult for guys to show emotion, and refuses to give Mary a better grade. She storms out.* Monty and Doyle go home. Out on the stoop, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), Monty's girlfriend, is waiting for him.She's been sitting there all day, worried when he was already gone when she woke up. He says he needed to get out. It's obvious that there's a lot of tension between them. She wants to know if they're going to spend any time together or what. He tells her about the party being thrown tonight for him by Uncle Nikolai, and she really doesn't want him to go, but he says he can hardly avoid it. She then has him open a jar of honey, and she eats it straight out of the jar with a spoon, which he calls disgusting, but then they kiss. She wants him to take a bath with her, and he refuses, saying maybe later.Then there's a FLASHBACK -- they're in the bath together, joking around about having kids and Monty teasing Nat for getting a tattoo of the Puerto Rican flag when she's lived her whole life in NYC.Someone's at the door, and Nat thinks it's her mom. But when she opens the door, it's the DEA! The DEA agents are really pretty nasty. They treat both Monty and Nat rudely, and it's obvious they know where the drugs are hidden. One of the agents opens up the couch cushions, taking out a bunch of money and drugs. Monty's fucked.Flash to the present, and Monty's sitting on the couch. Naturelle keeps bugging him about spending time together, and he tells her that she needs to be quiet. That he has to go see his dad and that he'll see her at the club later. He asks her to wear the silver dress, because that's how he wants to remember her. Then he gets dressed and takes off, leaving Doyle at home.Outside, Kostya is waiting at the stoop and reminds Monty about the party being held tonight by Uncle Nikolai in his honor. Monty's wondering why people keep insisting he go to the party. He says he'll be there with Naturelle and some friends. Kostya says he shouldn't bring Naturelle, and implies that she's the one who ratted him out. Evidently, that is what everyone believes. Monty goes off to have dinner with his dad.We next see Monty inside Brogan's, an Irish pub owned by his dad, James Brogan (Brian Cox). It's basically a fireman's hangout that has taken quite a hit in terms of business since 9/11.During their conversation, we discover that Monty's dad used to be a fireman and an alcoholic. His mom died when Monty was only 11, and James blames himself for how things have turned out. You could have been anything! A lawyer, a doctor! It also comes out that James evidently owed money to some guy named Sal and Monty's been paying it off. Where did you think that money came from? You didn't have any problems taking it, says Monty, and goes to take a leak.There's a really powerful scene in the bathroom as Monty looks in the mirror and sees that it's got Fuck You written on it. Monty begins to rant about just about everyone in New York, the blacks, the Koreans, the Jews, the Russians, the Italians, the Irish, etc. as a montage shows clips of various ethnicities and places in NYWC. He curses out his friends Frank and Jake, he curses out Naturelle, and in the end, he says, Fuck you, Montgomery Brogan, you had it all and you threw it all away. His rage is palpable. He tries to wipe the Fuck You off the mirror, but it's painted on.He returns to the table and asks his dad if he trusts Nat. He says it's been weird and he's not sure, maybe she's the one that fingered him. He says he only really trusts his dad and Frank and Jake, his two oldest friends. He leaves to go meet Frank and Jake, and his dad says he'll come in the morning to drive him to the jail.* There's another FLASHBACK to when Monty was taken in by the DEA. Naturelle gets let go and the DEA agents also imply that she was the one that fingered him. They threaten Monty with a 15-life sentence, explaining that the Rockefeller Laws in the state of NY make possession of that much drugs a major felony, and if he doesn't cooperate... They basically try to get him to sell out Uncle Nikolai, but he refuses and talks smack so it seems like they're going to throw the book at him.* In the meantime, Jake has come over to Frank's apartment, which overlooks Ground Zero. The two men talk as they look down at the horrifying sight. Frank says that he has no intention of moving. The two men then discuss Monty. Jake seems to think that after Monty gets out, they'll still be friends, but Frank tells him that it's going to be over. That Monty's not really going to survive prison and they'll never see him again. That Monty was a drug dealer and this is his fault that it ended up like this. We find out that when he was kicked out of the private school as a teenager (he was there on scholarship) it wasn't for fighting, but for selling weed to the other kids. Jake wonders what will happen to Doyle and wishes that Monty could take his beloved dog into jail with him.The two men then go over to a Chinese restaurant, where we find out more about the two. Frank tells Jake that Jake's in the 62nd percentile of all NY bachelors, while he, Frank, is in the 99 percentile. Criteria include the money he makes, whereas Jake (it turns out) has a trust fund and is ashamed of being a wealthy Jewish kid. Frank tells Jake that he also has chronic bad breath. Jake is really hurt by Frank's comments and points out that Frank has no table manners at all and he dyes his hair. As for Monty, he's in the 0 percentile. He's going to jail.* At some point, there's another FLASHBACK where we learn how Monty met Naturelle. She's a high school student loitering in a playground where Monty meets up with a man in a suit (I'm pretty sure that it's the same guy as the strung out junkie in the beginning of the film), who gives him a number to call. Monty, however, borrows Nat's lighter to burn the number. They start chatting and he asks if she's 18, which she says he is. She's also on the basketball team and they flirt a lot.* Now we cut to a bar where Frank and Jake are waiting for Monty and still talking about the percentile thing, which the cute female bartender is aware of. Haltingly, Jake starts telling Frank about his friend the teacher who has the hots for a student. Frank, naturally, sees through this, and gives Jake a hard time, saying he better not have fucked her. That he should wait til she's out of school. Then Naturelle shows up, looking the bomb in a silver latex dress. They joke around a little, with Frank asking why it is that girls always cry after really great sex. Nat goes to the bathroom, and Monty shows up. The bartender chick serves them free drinks and invites them all to her birthday party that weekend; there's a horrible, awkward moment. They drink and then they all take off to the club where the going-away party is being held.* There's a huge line to get into the club, but naturally they can get in through the back like VIPs. The bouncer out front gives Monty some tips about going to jail and to keep his head down. A really hot DJ is spinning tonight, some 17 yo kid named Dusk. As the gang heads toward the back entrance, Mary spies Jake and runs up to him. She wants to get into the club with her friends and Jake pretends to be into Dusk while she says she thought he'd be more into Barry Manilow. Monty has Mary go in, but not her friends.Inside the club, champagne is served and Mary drinks it right down. She and Naturelle go and dance, while Frank goes upstairs for some special whiskey. Jake and Monty share a quiet moment, where Jake tries to make a toast and fumbles. Monty says, let's drink to Doyle. He says that the best thing that ever happened to him was saving Doyle and that Jake should have him now, because Nat's going to live with her mom, and Doyle hates Frank. Jake is happy, but really worried that somehow it'll get out that he brought Mary into the club.Frank comes back and then Kostya shows up. Kostya says it's time to go see Uncle Nikolai and he, Monty, and Frank start going upstairs. Monty asks for 5 minutes alone with Frank. He tells Frank that he had all these thoughts of going straight and investing the money with Frank's help, but he got greedy. Frank basically tells him the opposite of the stuff he had said to Jake -- that Monty's a fighter, that he's going to be OK, that when he gets out, he'll be there for him and they can start an Irish bar together. That he's known Monty since age 3 and never once broken a promise to him. Monty says that is all true, but tomorrow is when he's really going to be in trouble -- when he goes to the jail and the pretty boy that he is, gets reamed out (literally) by all the other convicts. He says he has a plan that might buy him some time and he makes Frank promise to help. We don't see find out what it is, as it cuts away.In the meantime, Mary comes back to see that Jake's basically asleep at the table. Mary's totally drunk and had some E earlier. She's having a really good time, she really likes Nat, she starts to bump and grind against Jake. He asks her to keep all this quiet, she hints that he should raise her grade. Then she basically asks where's the bathroom, and goes up there (it's a very obvious come-on). Despite his better judgement, Jake goes up there and kisses her. It's a weird, awkward moment. She seems stunned. He leaves the bathroom without another word.Meanwhile, Nat is at another bar with Frank. She asks him to look out for Monty tonight, make sure he doesn't hurt himself (which is an underlying theme -- they think he might kill himself to avoid going to jail). Frank's drinking shot after shot of whiskey and he and Nat get into a fight. Basically, he accuses Nat of ratting out Monty and blames himself for not stopping him on his downward spiral. Up until this moment, it seemed like Frank may have been actually the one to rat him out, but it because obvious that he loves Monty and didn't. He tells Nat that she hasn't worked an honest day in her life and that he never took any of the money. Seven years from now, I'll be at the gate waiting for him, and you'll be married to money. She storms off. Jake comes and tells Frank he kissed Mary. Frank tells him to shut up and have another drink; that they can't leave yet because they have to be there for Monty.Monty and Kostya in the meantime are shown into a room where Uncle Nikolai is sitting. Kostya's gun is taken by the other thugs and it's a really tense scene. Uncle Nikolai is a Russian mobster who tells Monty about his first time in prison -- he was 14 years old, just a little boy. But he came out a man. He tells him that Monty should find someone who's not being protected and beat the shit out of him, and that way seem like he's a little crazy, but still respectful of the right people. Then Nikolai and the henchment basically threaten Monty with his father's life. They know everything about his dad and imply that they could take care of James -- either way, either by helping him out, or by snuffing him out. Monty begs them to leave his dad out of it, he says he wants out. He wants nothing to do with it anymore. He says he knows that they pinched him to get to Nikolai but that he didn't rat him out, he swears.There's a tense, tense moment where Nikolai points the gun at Monty. But then he says that he knows that Monty didn't say anything. But someone fingered Monty -- who was it? Only two people knew where he kept the drugs and money. Naturelle and Kostya!!! Kostya admits it was him! He says he had no choice as Monty basically holds the gun to his head. But Monty tells Nikolai to do his own dirty work and leaves without killing Kostya. Nikolai reminds Monty to survive and as the door closes, the other Russian mobsters are beating the shit out of Kostya and about to kill him.Monty, Frank, and Jake leave the club to go home and get Doyle. Monty asks if they don't mind staying out a little later to do something. Monty goes into the bedroom, where Naturelle is sleeping. He tells her he's sorry how it's been; that he knows it wasn't her. She says she loves him. He says he'll come back. He, and Frank, and Jake all go out walking by the river with Doyle. It's sort of like the scene earlier in the movie.Then they go into the park and Monty calls in his favor to Frank. He wants Frank to make him ugly so that maybe he won't get shafted on his first day of prison. Frank won't do it. They all start screaming at one another, and Monty tells Frank he knows he's wanted to slap some sense into him. Eventually, Jake gets in the middle, and Monty punches him. Then Frank starts to beat the shit out of him, and crying. It's a really powerful, visceral scene. Jake is able to get Monty back to his feet and he lurches back to home, where Naturelle is absolutely horrified to see him in this state. She tries to get him cleaned up and wants him to go to the hospital, but he refuses.We see Frank sitting in the same spot by the river that Monty was earlier. Jake's walking with Doyle and gets some attention from a girl because of it.Monty's dad shows up to take him to jail, and Monty reluctantly agrees to go. He tells Nat she should forget about him and live her life, though she swears she'll wait for him. She gives him ice for the horrifying injuries on his face, but he dumps it all out on his way down and gets into the car with his dad.As they drive up the turnpike, his dad offers to just keep driving. You'll lose your bar! What do you think matters to me more? The bar or my only son? Over a montage of scenes of them driving out west, James tells Monty of how he can find some town out there in the desert, disappear, make a new life for himself. He'll never see him again, but he'll know his boy's ok. Eventually, maybe, Monty can be reunited with Naturelle, and they can have kids and someday, he can tell the kids about his earlier life and how close it came that this blissful life almost didn't happen. We see this playing out -- them driving through the desert, them drinking a final shot of whiskey together, Monty getting a new ID, a new job, reunited with Nat, the kids, and everything.And as the almost didn't happen is said in the voiceover, we cut back to the car and see that they're still driving up the turnpike towards the jail, as Monty doses in a stupor.

title: Pompeii
synopsis: The film opens with a quote from Pliny the Younger commenting on the cries of devastation heard from the citizens of Pompeii, intercut with images of the victims encased in solid magma.Britannia, 62 A.D. The film opens showing a Celtic village of horsemen. A young boy named Milo walks out of his tent to discover his people fighting off an invading horde of Romans. Milo fearfully sees his father fight bravely before he gets killed by Roman soldiers. His mother pulls him away from the chaos, only to get hit by a horse riding in. Leading the Romans is Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland). He slashes Milo's mother across the neck as the boy lies on the ground and sees this, and then he orders the rest of the captured horsemen and villagers to be killed. The Romans pile their bodies on top of each other, including Milo, whom they believe to also be dead. The boy later pulls himself out of the pile and wanders. He is later found and taken by a group of men.17 years later (August 79 A.D.) in Londinium, the capital city of Britannia, a slave owner named Graecus (Joe Pingue) watches with boredom as several slaves fight against each other. He demands to see something new. The slave handler tells Graecus about a new gladiator known only as 'The Celt'. In enters an older Milo (Kit Harington), somberly walking before the crowd. He is pitted against three other gladiators, and in seconds, he swiftly kills each of them without mercy. Graecus is now intrigued.The slaves are escorted alongside Princess Cassia (Emily Browning) and her friend Ariadne (Jessica Lucas) in their carriage coming from Rome. The carriage hits a bump on the road, causing a horse to turn over and fall on its side. Cassia runs to the horse's side as it writhes in pain. Milo tells the slave keeper Bellator (Currie Graham) to unchain him so that he may tend to the horse. He doesn't do so until Cassia allows this. Milo runs to the horse and soothes it with one touch and a few whispered words. He tells Cassia to put pressure on its side so it doesn't feel the pain. He then breaks the horse's neck to put it out of its misery. Ariadne is horrified by this but Cassia knows Milo did the right thing.Upon their return to Pompeii, Cassia takes a good look at Mount Vesuvius. She travels to her family palace which sits on the lower slopes of Vesuvius. There, she reunites with her parents Severus (Jared Harris) and Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the man who tends the horses, Felix (Dalmar Abuzeid). Senator Corvus, accompanied by his lieutenant Proculus (Sasha Roiz), arrives from Rome with business to make with Severus for the new Roman emperor Titus. They plan to reconstruct the city, yet Corvus also has his eyes on Cassia, whom he had met during her stay in Rome, unbeknownst to her parents.Meanwhile, Milo is taken to the dungeon with the rest of the slaves. As he quietly eats, a larger slave confronts him, knowing Milo to be the one who killed his brother. Milo acts quickly and takes down the antagonist before he can make any further moves. This catches the eye of the African gladiator Atticus (Adewale Akkinouye-Agbaje).That evening, Felix is riding Vires, Cassia's favorite horse, through a field close to Vesuvius. The ground begins to shake and rumble. Frightened, the horse throws Felix off his back. The earth begins to crack. Felix starts to run but a chasm opens beneath him and he falls to his death.In the Pompeii arena the next morning, the gladiators are in training. Atticus is on his last day as a slave, and once he fights in the coming day, he will be free. He calls out for a challenger during a test fight in the arena, and Milo answers. The two of them duel with their wooden swords in front of the other gladiators. Milo has Atticus pinned to the ground when the angry slave from before draws a dagger to stab Milo in the back, but Atticus kicks the man away. Milo sees the dagger lying next to the man. Later in their cells, Milo asks Atticus why he saved him. He responds that a gladiator should not die with a knife in their back. Their death should come from the front. Suddenly, the earth starts to shake. Atticus reminds Milo it's coming from Vesuvius.That evening, the two men are taken into the palace during a celebration. A woman pays for time with Atticus (it's implied to be sexual), while Milo is taken to see Cassia. Vires has returned, distressed by the earthquakes. She allows Milo to privately tend to the horse, but then she joins him. He mounts it, and after a while, she takes his hand and hops on the horse's back. They ride the horse out of the palace, getting chased by Bellator and the guards. Milo asks Cassia to tell the Romans he forced her along, but she insists on telling the truth, that it was her idea. Corvus nearly kills Milo, who is now face-to-face for the first time since he was a child with the man who slaughtered his people, but Cassia has him spared by saying she would be grateful for Corvus's mercy. Milo receives 15 lashes as punishment, with Cassia, Ariadne, and Severus among those forced to watch.Atticus tends to Milo's wounds by pouring wine on his back. The earth shakes again, which Atticus says is a sign from the gods. Milo believes this to be true after seeing Corvus again. He believes he has been kept alive long enough for something bigger.The following day (August 24, 79 A.D.), the battle in arena takes place. To the surprise of the gladiators, they are not engaging in single combat, but rather, they are forced to fight dozens of Roman soldiers while being chained to a pillar. Corvus gives the word and commences the fight. The Roman soldiers charge toward the gladiators. They raise their shields as the soldier hurl spears their way. They continue charging, sparring with them using their swords. Together, Milo and Atticus fight back, breaking the pillar to crash down on the Romans until they are the only two survivors. Meanwhile, Corvus tells Cassia that Severus gave him consent for her hand in marriage. Aurelia is shocked and Severus says he did no such thing. Corvus blackmails them by saying that he will have her whole family hung unless she complies. Regretfully, she does. Milo then stands on the platform holding a scepter with the Roman eagle on it, crying I will not bow to the power of Rome! I spit on it! He breaks the scepter in half and hurls the pointed end at Corvus, but Proculus breaks it away with his sword. Milo and Atticus are nearly sentenced to death by a firing squad of arrows, but before Corvus can give the thumbs down, Cassia intervenes with a thumbs up. And then, the earth rumbles yet again... right before Vesuvius finally erupts. The arena crumbles, with many people falling or getting crushed by the lava stones. The rest of the citizens retreat while Cassia is taken away. A pillar falls onto the balcony where Corvus, Severus, and Aurelia are standing.As a hole opens in the ground of the arena, Milo pushes Proculus into it, bringing them to the dungeon. The two fight, and Proculus gets the upper hand, but Milo releases all the prisoners to chase after him. Proculus escapes and shuts the door, leaving Bellator behind to get beaten to death. Atticus is impressed with Milo's work.On the balcony, Severus and Aurelia wake up, severely weakened. She spots Corvus lying unconscious, telling Severus to kill him. Severus takes a knife and almost sticks it into Corvus until the man wakes up. He tells Severus he will no longer do business with him, and then impales him. He leaves with Proculus. Severus kisses Aurelia's forehead and takes her hand before he dies. Not long after, Milo finds a barely alive Aurelia, who tells him to find Cassia at the nearby villa to rescue her. She dies afterward.Vesuvius starts spewing fireballs that rain down on Pompeii, setting the city ablaze as the citizens run for the harbor. Graecus pays for his passage on a ship, but a fireball lands on his ship, sinking it as it sails out of the harbor. Other citizens are killed in the chaos and they are unable to escape the fireballs. Corvus and Proculus also kill people as they try running away.Milo runs to the villa where Cassia and Ariadne are. The roof crashes down, almost killing Cassia. Milo breaks the door down and rescues her. Ariadne brings her water as she is coughing. The three of them make it out of the villa before it is destroyed. The earthquakes happen again, causing the cliff near the villa to break. Ariadne runs toward Milo and Cassia, with the latter reaching out to grab her friend, but it is too late when Ariadne falls over the edge to her death. Milo gets Cassia out of there.Atticus is among those running to the harbor. The water starts rising, moving away from the shore. People fall off the ships or off the planks. A tsunami forms caused by the volcanic earthquake, heading toward the city. Atticus yells at everyone to run in the opposite direction. A mother is separated from her daughter and cannot reach her with everybody pulling her away. Atticus rescues the girl and guides her mother to safety, reuniting the two.Milo and Cassia reunite with Atticus, happy to see them both. He informs them that they can no longer make it to the shore, so they resolve to head south for the hills where most of the people are now fleeing to. Knowing they can't move quick enough on foot, they run back to the arena to get horses. Cassia finds the bodies of her parents, holding hands. As she mourns them, she is capture by Proculus. At the same time, Milo and Atticus evade the Roman soldiers. They find Corvus shackling Cassia to his cart, ready to make off with her, leaving the soldiers to kill Milo. Together, he and Atticus easily kill all of them before Corvus flees. Atticus tells Milo to go get Cassia while he stays to fight Proculus. The two gladiators bid each other goodbye and promise to see each other again soon. As he leaves, Atticus battles Proculus in a sword fight. Despite putting up a good fight, Atticus is impaled with Proculus's sword. A barbarian does not die equal to a Roman, he snarls. Atticus breaks off the sword and takes Proculus's wrist with the broken edge, raising it slowly to his neck. Let's see if a Roman can die equal to a gladiator. Proculus starts to beg for mercy, but Atticus retorts, A gladiator does not beg! before sticking the broken edge into Proculus's neck, killing him.Milo rides Vires as he chases after Corvus through the streets. Cassia breaks off a piece of wood from the cart and unlocks herself. She tries to attack Corvus, but he knocks her off the cart before Corvus gets thrown off when his chariot hits a bump. Milo runs to Cassia, but Corvus almost slays both of them. Milo finally fights Corvus in one last duel. He stabs Corvus in the arm as Vesuvius erupts one more time, sending a fireball crashing down. The smoke fills up, and Cassia sees a figure emerging from it. It's Corvus. However, Milo tackles him and brings him down. Corvus reaches for his blade but Cassia chains him to a rock. Milo reminds Corvus that he is the one who killed his family, yet he chooses not to directly kill Corvus. He rides off with Cassia as the final eruption sends a wave of ash and fire all across the city. Corvus screams as he is burnt to a crisp, while Atticus raises a fist in salute to the skies and embraces his fate, knowing he will die a free man.Milo and Cassia manage to ride out of the city toward the hills, but Vires throws Cassia off, too weak to keep going. Milo knows the horse can't take both of them, so he tells Cassia to go on without him. She refuses, not wanting to spend her last moments running. The two look into each others eyes and share their only kiss, mere seconds before they too are consumed by the ash cloud.The film ends with a shot of Milo and Cassia's bodies encased in solid magma, still locked in a passionate kiss.

title: The Dish
synopsis: Parkes (Australia), has a huge dish in the middle of a sheep paddock. It will transmit the first landing of humanity on the Moon, and the famous Neil Armstrong's moonwalk. They will be the ones broadcasting the moonwalk to a world audience which will remain the highest for many years to come.Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill) goes back to the satellite station and remembers it all. He was the chief scientifical supervisor, but then NASA took over. Not all employees accept that, and some of them are quite rude to NASA's representative and chielf operations director.The Mayor of the town of Parkes, Bob McIntyre (Roy Billing) acknowledges that this is the moment for him and his town to perform a great deed. Australian Prime Minister (Bille Brown) arrives, with a full gathering of people among which is American Ambassador (John McMartin), who insists on seeing the premises himself. Back at the station, Rudi (Tayler Kane) is one of the funniest characters. He's given a gun, becuase NASA demanded armed security, but when his sister Janine (Eliza Szonert) appears, and notices it, he begs her not to tell mum, or she will come to take it from me. Janine is constantly providing home-made food for the dish's personnel, because she has a love interest in one of the mathematicians who work there. He is very shy, though, and it takes him a lot of time, mocking and coaxing from his workmates to ask her for a date. Rudi keeps changing the names of the areas within the complex A, B, C....The McIntyres prepare themselves for their outstanding visitors, However, the eldest daughter Marie (Lenka Kripac) is constantly making rude remarks, the son Billy (Carl Snell) knows about the technical data about the landing and tries to explain them to his father - who can never fully grasp it-, and the wife May (Genevieve Mooy) is worried most of all about her dressing. Another fun moment is when she asks her husband to choose among two dresses, one blue and another one lemon-coloured. McIntyre keeps on saying that it is a yellow dress, and May corrects him saying it's lemon. When McIntyre introduces his wife to the ambassador, he is so nervous that he introduces his wife saying she's the lemon.There are two main events at the station:
1- One of the employees does not charge enough fuel to one of the power stations. There is a sudden blackout and the station computers lose all data, so the staff at the complex loses all communication with Apollo 11's crew, because they cannot pinpoint the dish towards the rocket. However, nobody wants to admit their mistake to the NASA, in fear that they will leave them out of the broadcasting team. Finally, they find the location just in time.2- One of the reasons why Parkes was chosen was its perfectly stable weather. However, all of a sudden, a gale starts. Nobody expected such strong winds in Australia, - least of all the weather forecasters - but neither the dish nor the station had been designed to stand them. They decide to take their chances at broadcasting, because Armstrong has overruled a programmed sleep and has decided to go out of the rocket sooner than expected. If Parkes does not broadcast it, nobody will see it. The wind gets so strong, that the station crew is afraid that all the structure could collapse with them inside the building. However, they finally do it. Cliff remembers his late wife, who had suppported him through the years and dedicates his success to her memory.Back to the present time, a white-haired Cliff Buxton is told-off by more efficiente security guard who doesn't recognise him. He tells them that visitors are only permitted through the main gate. Cliff says that it doesn't matter, and leaves the premises whitout more ado.

title: Vampires
synopsis: Jack Crow (James Woods) is a professional and Vatican-funded vampire slayer. He and his team of slayers have just rooted out a nest of nine vampires in the New Mexico desert but, disappointingly, the master vampire--Jan Valek--was not there. Still, the team is partying at the Sun God Motel, rejoicing in their victory. Unbeknown to the slayers,
Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) is in the adjoining room, seducing and biting Katrina (Sheryl Lee), a hooker hired for the party. Before Jack is even aware of Valek's presence, Valek has viciously slain his entire team as well as all the hookers. During the battle, Valek says Jack's name, which takes the slayer by surprise. Only Jack, Katrina, and Jack's partner Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) manage to escape.After beheading and burning the bodies of his team (to make sure they don't turn into vampires), Jack goes directly to Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell) for further instructions. Alba has more bad news. Their European team was also wiped out three days ago near Cologne, Germany, and a portrait of Jan Valek was found there. According to archivist,
Father Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee), Valek was a 14th century priest who turned against the church and was burned at the stake for heresy. After his death, however, Valek became a vampire, the first of his kind. The Vatican wants Jack to rebuild his team, and they give him Guiteau as his first replacement. Jack wants nothing to do with the milquetoast bookworm, especially because he suspects the team's slaying was a setup, and it could just as easily have been Guiteau as anyone else in the church. After physically abusing Guiteau a few times, Jack levels with him. He shows him a map of where nests of vampires have been killed in the Southwest since the 1800s.It shows a pattern of an ever-widening circle, and Jack thinks that they're searching for something. Furthermore, he thinks they might be searching for a black cross that he heard of when he was young.Meanwhile, Montoya and Katrina are holed up in a hotel. Katrina hasn't turned yet and, when she finds out that she's been bitten by a vampire. Montoya wants to keep her around because of her telepathic link to Valek. She tries to commit suicide by jumping off a ledge but Montoya manages to pull her back through the window, but he cuts his arm while doing so, and Katrina grabs it and starts sucking. Montoya knocks her out and then burns the bite with a lighter, hoping to sterilize it from the sickness that will convert him. When Katrina awakens, she starts having visions. The first one is of Valek in a church in San Miguel County. The next vision shows Valek looking at a map and then killing a priest. Guiteau offers to get a list of all the churches in the county, a clue that leads them to Father Molina, whose body was found decapitated and laying alongside a dirt road.After further brutal interrogation by Jack, Guiteau finally confesses that Molina was the only one in the world who knew the whereabouts of the black Bersier cross, an ancient relic that was used in the exorcism meant to drive the demons from Valek's body. Unfortunately, the exorcism resulted in turning him into a vampire was never completed, leaving Valek vulnerable to the sun. He needs the cross now to finish the ritual. If he succeeds, he will be able to live in the daytime. A master vampire able to walk in the sun would be unstoppable.It's sundown and Valek with a new group of vampires are rising from the ground where they sleep. Through her telepathic connection to Valek, Katrina can tell that he is accompanied by seven other master vampires. She can see them headed into a small Spanish mission. She can see the vampires brutally slaying the mission clerics. And she can see Valek taking down the black cross. He's got it! she smiles.The next day Katrina leads Jack and Montoya to the small, deserted town of Santiago where she says Valek is hiding in the best-contructed building in town -- the jailhouse. With only three slayers and as many as 30 vampires, Jack, Montoya, and Guiteau have their work cut out for them. As the day wears on, Guiteau lures out the vampires, Jack shoots stakes into their chests from his crossbow, and Montoya drives the winch that pulls the vampires out into the sun where they burn up. With the sun setting rapidly, it is time to end the day's work before the other vampires wake up. Montoya and Katrina escape in the jeep, Guiteau hides behind a counter in a restaurant, finding a shotgun, but Valek catches Jack and ties him up.Jack wonders why Valek just doesn't kill him. Suddenly, Cardinal Alba steps out of the shadows. Admitting he was the one who betrayed the slayers, he says he's struck a deal with Valek, to give him immortality for finishing the ritual that will complete Valek's transformation.Meanwhile, Katrina has completed her change. She bites Montoya's neck, drinks some of his blood, and then leaves him for dead in the jeep and rejoins Valek and his vampires. Montoya shoots off a few rounds with his gun and then places the hot barrel to his neck, hoping to sterilize the bite.The ceremony is beginning, and Jack discovers that he is to part of it, because the ceremony requires a ritual sacrifice by crucifixion of a slayer at the moment of dawn. The vampires tie Jack to a cross, and Alba begins by slicing Jack's leg, collecting the blood, and passing it to Valek to drink. As the sun begins to rise, Guiteau (who has been listening to everything from his hiding place in the restaurant) shoots Alba. With no priest to finish the ritual, Valek tries to force Guiteau to do it, but Guiteau turns the gun on himself. Just when it looks like Guiteau might have to shoot himself, Montoya appears in the jeep. He fires a stake into the cross and, using the winch, pulls it down. Guiteau leaps forward and cuts Jack free. As the sun continues to rise, the vampires run for cover, with Jack and Guiteau following.They trap Valek, who leaps at Jack. Jack holds up the Bersier cross and Valek lands on it, impaling himself. As Valek attempts to pull out the cross, Jack pulls down the dilapidated ceiling. The sunlight streams in, and Valek bursts into flames.In the final scene, knowing that they have more vampires to kill, Montoya finally admits to Jack that he's been bitten twice by Katrina, who is lying in the back of the truck in order to stay out of the sun. He also says that he can no longer function as a slayer and that he intends to take Katrina south where he can take care of her. Guiteau tries to kill Montoya, but Jack steps between them. Knowing that Montoya was first bitten two days ago but still saved his life in the fight with the vampires, Jack figures he owes Montoya two days. However, he promises that, when those two days are up, he will hunt down Montoya and Katrina and kill both of them. The soon-to-be-turned vamp Montoya and the vampire Katrina drive away while Jack and Guiteau stay behind to clean up the town of the surviving vampires before pursing them.[Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]

title: Payback
synopsis: Note: This is a synopsis of the threatrical release of PAYBACK. There is also a Director's Cut in circulation. The chapters are from the DVD of the film.1. Quality health care.A wounded man, Porter (Mel Gibson), has bullets extracted from his back by a scruffy-looking, middle-aged, medical guy, someone probably disbarred from legally practicing medicine, who uses alcohol in equal parts as a disinfectant and an emotional support.Porter; Voice-Over: GSW. That's what the hospitals call it. Gunshot wound. Doctor has to report it to the police. That makes it hard for guys in my line to get what I'd call 'quality health care'. Not many men know what their life is worth. I do. Seventy grand. That's what they took from me. And that's what I was going to get back.Some time later, the now-recovered Porter walks across the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan, but he's not feeling groovy. He is crossing his own private Rubicon.V.O. continues: They say, 'Time heals all wounds.' You'd think that after five months of lying on my back, I would've given up any idea of getting even. Just be a nice guy, call it a day. Nice guys are fine. You've gotta have someone to take advantage of. But they always finish last.Porter helps himself to cash from a beggar's hat. The beggar, who had been loudly describing himself as a cripple, leaps up, only to be restrained by Porter. (Shut up! I cured you!) In a coffee shop, Porter uses his stolen cash to buy himself a cup of coffee and a small sandwich. He asks for a cigarette from the waitress at the counter, and then steals the packet of cigarettes from the waitress after paying the bill. (He does a lot of smoking in this movie.) On the street again, he picks a pocket of a wealthy businessman, taking a wallet. In a restroom, he examines the ID photo of the guy he robbed. The man in the photo is smiling. Porter tries to mimic the smile but it's a struggle; he hasn't had a lot to smile about lately. He withdraws a few hundred dollars in cash at a bank using the debit card, He buys a new suit for himself on credit using the stolen credit card. Next, Porter uses the credit card to purchase three gold wristwatches, which he pawns for a large .44 Magnum revolver and $500 in cash. That evening, he eats a meal in a fancy restaurant. When it comes time to pay the bill, a waiter tells Porter that the credit card has bounced -- its been cancelled, but Porter bluffs his way through and leaves without paying the bill despite the large amount of cash he has on him in $100 notes.2. Ain't marriage grand?That night, Porter waits outside an apartment block. An inebriated woman arrives, a willowy blonde named Lynn Porter (Deborah Kara Unger). Porter follows her inside and kicks in her apartment door. After looking around and finding no one else in the apartment, Porter stands over the stoned Lynn. She looks up and recognises him. (You're not dead.) She clearly expects the worst from him. He picks her up and puts her on the bed. Porter spots her heroin stash. She grabs it. He takes it away from her. (You're cleaning up.) He locks the door to her bedroom, then takes a shower. Alone in her bedroom, Lynn goes to her walk-in closet where it's revealed that she has a secret dope stash.Porter sleeps on the couch in the living room. Next morning, he wakes up and checks up on her in the bedroom. Lynn is dead from a heroin overdose. He pulls the needle out of her arm and stabs the syringe into the wall. It has his wedding ring hanging on it. He lies down on the bed next to her dead body.3. The heist.In a flashback sequence five or six months earlier, Porter speaks to someone called Val (Gregg Henry) on the phone. They're planning something. On the street, Val explains the target. Some Chinese gangsters have a set routine, servicing a Chinese money laundry. How much do you need, Val? says Porter. This is a key question. How much does Val need to buy his way back into a crime organization called the Outfit? Val replies, $130,000.The Chinese gangsters drive past, up an alley. Porter observes them, then decides their program: You notice anything about those guys? They weren't wearing their seat belts. We'll hit 'em on Friday.Cut to Friday. Porter driving flat out, down the same alley, but in the opposite direction. There is a head-on smash. Porter cuts free the bag of money. Val demonstrates that he is a sadist; he beats up an unconscious gangster for the fun of it. Porter's wife, Lynn, arrives in another car. The three depart together.4. Double-cross.Inside an empty warehouse, they count the money which adds up to $140,000 in cash, which means a 50-50 split to $70,000... not enough for Val. Porter says, We got away clean. Always be grateful for what you get. Rule Number One, Val. There are signs of tension, mistrust. Val says, This is funny. This'll kill ya. It's always $140 grand.Suddenly Porter's wife pulls a gun and shoots Porter twice in the back. Val explains to Porter: Lynn did not understand. He shows him a photo of Porter and some other woman, very friendly. Wives get funny when it comes to girlfriends. As a farewell, he kicks Porter in the head, then gets in the car and they drive away with all the money for himself. The flashback ends.5. Worry about me.Porter is lying on the bed next to his dead wife. There is a knock at the door. A punk delivery boy is outside. (Come on, Miss Porter, I don't have all day.) Porter drags him inside, searches him, and finds heroin. The kid has a smart mouth. Porter rips out a nose ring. (Where'd you get the envelope?) The kid worries about them. Porter says, Worry about me! The kid provides a name: Arthur Stegman, and an address. Porter says, Thanks. Porter lets the punk kid go.6. Stegman's place.Porter climbs the steps to a rundown, upstairs office. A large black man is reading a newspaper behind the front counter. Porter asks for Arthur Stegman. The black guy says he's not there. Porter persists. He at home? The black guy suggests he go fuck himself.Cut to an inside room. Stegman (David Paymer) is playing craps with two plain clothes cops named Detective Hicks (Bill Duke) and Detective Leary (Jack Conley). The door opens. The large black guy enters, holding his head after apparently being punched by Porter. (There's somebody here to see you.) Porter is behind him. (I'm looking for Stegman. Your boy didn't make his delivery.) Porter throws the heroin on the table. The cops are surprised, but not troubled, to discover Stegman is a drug dealer. Stegman and Porter go outside.On the street, Porter asks where Val Resnick is. Stegman claims: He's in the city, that's all I know. He said he squared himself with the Syndicate. That he was back in the big time. Porter says: Well you tell him Porter is back too, and he wants his money.7. I'm working here.An Asian woman dominatrix named Pearl (Lucy Liu), arrives at the Oakwood Arms Hotel. A phone rings in a room. Val Resnick answers. (Send her up.) The woman is directed to a hotel room. Val's phone rings again. (Send her up. What's the problem?) But it's someone else, with news about Stegman. Pearl arrives at the door. They have a sado-masochistic exchange with both of them punching each other in their faces. The voice on the phone tells Val about Stegman getting a visit from some heavy. (I thought you oughta know.) Resnick arranges a meeting.8. Only name's she got.Inside a dive bar, Porter talks to a woman. He's looking for a girl. She goes by the name of Rosie. I wouldn't know her, says the woman. Porter flashes some cash. (Maybe you'd know someone who would.) He shows her the photo, folded in half so only the girl is in view. The woman unfolds it, sees it's Porter with her. Try Michael. Bartender at the Regal Hotel, says the woman. She reaches for the money. That wasn't the name I was looking for. The only one I got. There's a minor tug-of-war over a single bank note. Porter lets it go. Maybe he's softening.9. A little tense.Val Resnick arrives by taxi at a crappy looking restaurant to meet Stegman who tells him about his visit with Porter. Val asks about the guy. What'd he say? asks Val. I just got the feeling he'd like to kill you, that's all, says Stegman. Resnick is rattled. He makes a threatening move against another customer. Stegman smoothes things over and they leave.10. Be discreet now.Inside a bar at the Regal Hotel, Porter is looking for Michael, who turns out to be a young but smarmy bartender. Porter asks about Rosie and offers him bribe money by laying out a $100 bill on the counter. But the trashy Michael implies that he wants more money by saying: Usually these matters are conducted with more discretion. Porter angrily slams a door on his fingers, injuring Michael's hand. Be discreet now, says Porter. Michael rings Rosie. Porter snatches the phone from Michael and takes over the call. Who's this? Rosie asks. Porter. Try again, honey. Porter's dead, says Rosie. Porter replies: I used to drive for you. Provide a safe work environment. Porter? says Rosie. Porter leaves, but neverless leaves behind the bribe money for the injured Michael who is tending to his wounded hand.11. Old friends.As Porter walks toward Rosie's apartment building, we hear in V.O.: Why pour salt on old wounds? I didn't need to. I guess I had a soft spot for her.Rosie (Maria Bello) opens the door. (She is the same woman in the photo that Val showed Porter after betraying him months earlier). In contrast to his wife's reaction, she runs to Porter; embraces him. (Come on, come in. You look pretty good for a dead guy.) They talk. She learns his wife is dead. (I'm sorry, Porter. Why? Surly Porter. You're the same as ever.) She walks into the lounge, where there is a large guard dog. What's his name? Porter asks. Porter. He took your job after you left. He's just as tough, but he won't leave me. says Rosie. Porter says he's looking for Val Resnick. She knows him. She tells Porter that he is a top lieutenant with The Outfit, a local crime syndicate. (He beats up all the girls. He almost killed one.) Even you? asks Porter. Does it matter? You quit looking after me says Rosie. She gives him Val's address.12. Let her work.It's night in Resnick's room. He is asleep in bed with Pearl. Resnick wakes to find Porter looking at him. Hi, Val. Where's my money? says Porter. Val reaches for his gun, but Porter's already got it. My seventy grand. I want it. Resnick tells him that he gave it all to the Syndicate as a bribe to be let back into their organization. Tomorrow. Noon. You and the money be at the corner of 7th and Franklin at the payphone, Porter says before leaving. Porter asks Val about the photo with him and Rosie and how Val acquired it. Some hooker had it. I recognised you. I swiped it in case I could use it, says Resnick. Did you hurt her? asks Porter. What does that have to do with anything? asks Resnick. Porter knocks him unconscious, then goes to leave. Pearl seductively says: I've got a few minutes. Porter replies, So? Go boil an egg.13. Mo more unpleasantness.The next morning, Val Resnick is in an office and sitting in front of Carter (William Devane), a mob under-boss of the Syndicate. The uneasy Val tells Carter about his ex-partner-in-crime Porter and Val wants him dead. Phillip says you have a problem you need help with. You've allowed an area of your personal life to become a danger to us. Until the matter is handled, I want you to move out of the Oakwood Arms, says Carter. Val angrily leaves. Carter charges his right-hand man Phillip (John Glover) with the job of killing Porter. When Phillip asks if they should inform the boss about this, Carter tells Phillip to keep it to himself about the Val Resnick-Porter situation. Carter says: I don't want Mr. Bronson hearing about this. He'll think I'm going soft. His motto is: 'if there's something that you don't understand, get rid of it'. Stitch this mutt up, Phil.Meanwhile, Pearl and Val talk on the phone. Pearl is with another S&M client in an apartment Did your friends make it to town? Did you tell 'em it was Porter took their payroll? asks Val. I did. And they want retribution, says Pearl who is apparently connected with the Chinese Triad gangsters that Val Resnick and Porter ripped off.14. Porter's new friends.It's 12:00 PM. Val Resnick is standing in the street. Porter starts walking toward him. A car comes hurtling around a corner and knocks Porter down. Pearl and four Chinese gangsters get out and slap him around. Then the two corrupt cops, Hicks and Leary arrive forcing Pearl and her posse of Chinese thugs to leave. The two dirty cops stand up Porter to his feet and one of them says, Stegman says you've got a line on a load of cash, Porter. 250 grand to be exact. The cops push him around. (We've got a dead girl full of heroin. Don't worry, Porter. We're going to give you immunity. All you gotta do is get the money. Oh, we can't help you, though. It'd be against the law.) They slap him around some more and leave him in the alley.V.O. Crooked cops. Did they come any other way? If I'd been just a little dumber, I could've joined the force myself.Porter has one of the cop's badges; he picked his pocket while they were shoving him around.15. Too thickheaded.A wounded and bruised Porter arrives at Rosie's apartment building. Resnick pulls up in a taxi (he's been following Porter), and watches him go inside. Rosie applies first aid to Porter. She gets angry and starts to walk away, but when she spots the photo of her and Porter together, she returns and asks: When did you decide to leave? Was it the night we slept together? No. It was the next day when I had to drive you to work. You could've asked me to quit. You could've asked me to drive you somewhere else, says Porter. Porter puts on a clean shirt. Rosie says, I think all the stories about you being dead were true, You're just too thick-headed to admit it. Porter and Rosie kiss. He leaves. She doesn't want him to. He says he has to.16. Val corners Rosie.There is a knock at the door. Rosie thinks it's Porter. Instead, it's Resnick. Where is he? Porter? asks Val. He's in the bedroom. says Rosie. Resnick grabs her by the hair and forces her to walk in front of him. He walks into the darkened bedroom. As Val goes to shoot Porter in the bed, the dog leaps out. He shoots the dog. Rosie tries to hit Resnick, but. misses. He knocks her down. Where is he? Val asks. He's gone. Rosie says. I know you. You're that whore from the picture. I'm going to fuck you six ways from Sunday! says Val. When Val asks Rosie how she knows Porter, she tells him that Porter used to work as a driver for a limo service and he used to drive her to various jobs while she worked as an escort and call girl for the Syndicate. Porter saved her from various johns that would rough up women.17. Hasn't got a light.The door bursts open. Porter enters, gun in hand, and shoots Val in the shoulder. Val goes for his ankle holster, and Porter shoots him in the leg. Porter says to Rosie: I forgot my cigarettes.All right, Val. This Syndicate or Outfit or whatever you call it, it's got a head man, right?, ask Porter.They'll kill me if I tell you anything, Porter, Resnick says.Worry about me! says Porter.Resnick caves in and replies: Fairfax and Carter. They run the whole city.Where do I find them? asks Porter.Resnick gives the address to Carter's office, then tries his I'll-be-your-friend routine. Porter shoots him dead. Rosie is shocked. Porter lights a cigarette and says: Rosie, gather up everything you need. Say goodbye to this place.18. Wrong number.Porter walks into a rundown apartment, carrying the wounded dog, and followed by Rosie. She's not impressed by the apartment. (It's not much, but at least you'll be safe. Nobody knows I live here. So relax.) The phone rings. Nobody has this number! exclaims Porter. He checks the phone, the cable, and finds a bomb under the bed. Porter looks out the window. There's a parked car with three heavies in it, one holding a phone. (Somebody does know I'm here.)Outside in the street, there are three hoods in the car. Phillip is in the back seat. A knife cuts a fuel line. Fuel leaks out onto the road. Phillip says, Okay, let's give them another bell. The driver picks up the phone, looks in the rear view mirror, sees Porter. (Shit, he's behind us.) They turn to look. Porter drops a lighted cigarette. The fuel ignites, engulfs the car, which explodes killing Phil and the two thugs.V.O. It's not just anybody that gets a hit put on them by a big firm like the Outfit. I was moving up in the world. Maybe it was time to pay them a visit. Carter wouldn't be expecting that. And, who knows, I might even get my money back.19. A ridealong.Porter walks round a corner at night. Opens a newspaper dispensing box, hides his gun under some newspapers. The two corrupt cops, Hicks and Leary, arrive in a car. Porter thinks again, retrieves the gun, hides it behind a newspaper. What's up, buddy? asks Hicks. Well the money's in there, if you're still interested. says Porter. Stegman is in the back seat. (What are you waiting for, Porter. Go get our money.) Porter says,You guys do me a favor? They'll probably frisk me when I go in there. He pulls out the gun. If you wouldn't mind holding onto this, just for a little while. One of the cops plays with the gun. (Nice balance.) Porter leaves, walks into an impressive looking office tower building.20. Visiting Carter.A hood walks into an outer office and asks Porter: Can I help you? I want to see Mr. Carter. says Porter. Turn around so I can frisk you. says the thug. He frisks. A door opens on an inside office. Porter walks in. Carter sits at a desk, a heavy stands on one side, the other hood follows him in. Porter drops the two hoods; two punches, one kick to the head. Picks up a gun. Looks around.Carter says, Bravo, sit down. Porter sits. There's something you want from me? says Carter. Porter explains all about Val and about the $70,000 which he gave to them as a part of his $130,000 bribe to be let back into the Syndicate, and Porter now wants the Syndicate to compensate him for the money of his share that Val stole from their robbery job.No corporation in the world would agree to what you're asking, says Carter.What about Fairfax, will he give me my money? asks Porter.We're not authorised to do things like this, says Carter.Who is? Porter asks. Carter replies that his superior and the leader of the Outfit: Bronson.Inside a mansion, Bronson (Kris Kristofferson) is working out on a rowing machine. A phone rings. Bronson and Carter start to talk, but Bronson's teenage son Johnny Bronson Jr. (Trevor St. John) walks in. (Hang on Carter.) He gives his son the keys to a Ferrari. (Happy birthday, son.) The kid has a new car and ringside tickets to the championship boxing fight tonight. The kid leaves. They resume the phone call. Both Carter and Porter overhear the conversation. Carter explains over the phone:I have a problem. There's a man in my office with a gun, who says he's going to kill me if we don't pay him $130,000 that one of our lieutenants stole from him.Porter tries to explain that it's actually $70,000, half from a $140,000 job that he and Val Resnick pulled off. However, Bronson is clearly reluctant to negotiate with Porter (either because of pride or because he's afraid of hurting his tough-guy reputation). Porter becomes frustrated by Bronson's stalling tactic.Either I get my money or I kill Carter! My money. Yes or no?, asks Porter.No! says Bronson.BANG. Carter falls from his chair... dead. Porter yells over the phone: call Fairfax and tell him I just croaked Carter. And he's next, and then you unless I get my money! After hanging up the phone, Porter picks up an address book off the desk, turns to Fairfax's address.21. Lighten the load.Porter walks back out onto the street. The two dirty cops are waiting in the parked car. Porter is still carrying the newspaper. I don't see any cash, one says. They gave me the runaround. I have to go see another guy. Can I have my piece back? asks Porter. (Oh, yeah.) Hicks empties the bullets from the gun and hands it back. Porter accepts it inside the newspaper. (Nice Roscoe, Porter) Porter walks away.V.O.: No one likes a monkey on their back. I had three on mine. And they were cramping my style. I was going to have to lighten the load.Inside Rosie's apartment, Val Resnick lies dead on the floor. Porter walks in, opens his newspaper and slides the gun with the two cops fingerprints on it next to the body. Then he takes out the cop badge he lifted earlier, wipes off his prints and places it in the dead guy's hand.22. They should have.Rosie is in a cafe, drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, waiting. Porter walks in.They're not going to stop until they kill us, are they? asks Rosie.No. I'm sorry I got you involved in this, says Porter.So why did you? asks Rosie.When I came back here I had nothing. No life. No hope. You were the only good thing that hadn't been taken from me. I couldn't stay away. I had to see you just to make sure I wasn't in hell, says Porter.So why don't we get out of here? asks Rosie.They won't stop until they bury us. says PorterSo? says Rosie.So, we bury them first. says Porter.That same night, Porter is driving a limo. Rosie is in the back seat, wearing a party dress. He's looking at her in the rear view mirror. She catches him looking. Long slow, reflective moment. I should have quit. I should have driven you somewhere else.23. Happy birthday.Inside a stadium, two black guys are boxing. Crowd is into it, riding every punch. The bell goes, the round ends. Binoculars scan the ringside seats. Porter is watching. An electronic scoreboard lights up with HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHNNY. Three young guys ringside, Johnny Bronson in the middle, spot it. React. That's me. Porter finds him. Outside the stadium, people are leaving. Johnny and friends walk out. Rosie calls out: Hey Johnny! They turn and look. Check her out from the feet up. She is sexy, seductive. (I'm your birthday present.) The boys react. Both of Johnny's friends deny hiring her. She's so fine, one of them says. They push him toward the limo. Don't wait up, boys. I promise he won't be home before midnight, Rosie says. He follows her into the limo.The limo rolls along in traffic. Johnny is trying some preliminary nuzzling and fondling. (There's a good boy.) She handcuffs one hand. Johnny is surprised. (Who's the professional here? So go with it.) He relaxes. Rosie cuffs the other hand to the limo wall and then backs away. The divider slides down. Porter says: Relax, kid, no one'll get hurt. Johnny's puzzled. What's he talking about? says Johnny.24. Two death threats.The next morning, a limo pulls up outside an expensive town house. The second mob underboss Fairfax (James Coburn) gets out. Two bodyguards carry Fairfax's suitcases inside. Stegman and the black guy sit in a taxi, watching. (Porter and Fairfax. I bet that'll be a short conversation.) Stegman looks at a parked car in a side alley. (Between us and our neighborhood cops, I'd say we got him pretty well covered.)Inside the house, a guy is slumped against the wall. (Walter, wake up.) Fairfax walks into a very expensively furnished room. Porter emerges from behind a pillar, gun in hand. (I'm the reason you're home early, Mr Fairfax. I want you to do me a favour. Call Mr. Bronson.) Fairfax picks up the phone and rings. Hello. Mr. Bronson... well it's like this. I'm standing in my living room. There's a man here named Porter. He says that he expects you to pay him, sooner or later, says Fairfax. To Porter: He wants to talk to you. Put it on the speaker.On the phone from his house Bronson says, To get rid of you, I'll swat you with the 130 grand!Porter replies, You people aren't listening. It's not 130...But the angry Bronson cuts him off by saying, No, you listen! You'll get your money, but you'll never live to enjoy it.Porter says: You let me worry about that. And one condition; I want you to deliver the money yourself.Bronson asks: What makes you think I'll deliver it myself?Porter replies: Because if you don't, you'll never see your son, little Johnny, again. He didn't come home from the fight last night, did he?Bronson replies: Bullshit! You haven't got him. Denial. Anger. Threats. Bronson asks where and when he will deliver the money.Porter replies: I'll let you know.The angry Bronson says, You just signed your own death warrant! Nobody messes with me, the Outfit, or my family!!!!After Bronson hangs up, Porter leaves and tells Fairfax to tell Bronson that the money he wants is only $70,000. Fairfax is surprised and shouts as Porter exits: Seventy? Only seventy thousand? Hell, all my suits together are worth more then that!25. Lost items.Meanwhile, the two crooked cops sit in a parked car in an alley. Leary is reading the paper and oohing and ahhing over an ad for a sailboat, while Hicks is discussing the latest horse racing form and of them putting more bets and hope to make up for their $150,000 losses of betting. Suddenly, two guys in black suits walk up. They are from the police department's Internal Affairs Bureau. You wanna step out of the car, please? one of the IAB agents asks.Stegman and the black guy, watching, as cops in uniform walk with the Internal Affairs agents up to the car.What the hell is going on? Detective Hicks asks.Is this your badge, detective? as the IAB agent shows them in an evidence bag.Where'd you find it? asks Leary.Where exactly did you lose it? asks the IAB agent who shows him Porter's gun in a plastic bag. Does this belong to you? asks the agent. The two dirty cops realize, way too late, that Porter has framed them.As Hicks and Leary are being led away by the police, Porter walks out of Fairfax's house. Stegman sees him and he tells the black guy, Follow him.26. A bad cab ride.Porter is crossing the street. A taxi comes round the corner. Porter hails, opens the door and Stegman is in the back seat holding a gun. Get in, Porter! he says. Porter gets in and drops his gun on the floor. As Stegman gloats, Porter snatches Stegman's gun out of his hand. (You're not gonna kill me, are ya?) Porter bangs Stegman's head against the door. The black guy pulls out a shotgun. (Let him go!) Suddenly, a van pulls up alongside containing four Chinese gangsters, plus Pearl, all of whom open fire with automatic weapons. In the wall of gunfire, Porter uses Stegman as a shield who gets killed as does the black guy. Porter crawls out of the car and opens fire on the Chinese gangsters, killing two of them. Pearl and her henchmen return fire. The driver puts the van in reverse, and slams Porter into a crate of boxes. Porter slides under the van and shoots through the floor, killing all of the surviving Chinese gangsters. When he climbs back up, Pearl appears outside the van and puts a gun against his head and immediately pulls the trigger... but she's out of bullets. Porter aims his gun at her and pulls the trigger... and he is also out of bullets. Just when Porter and Pearl seem about to engage each other in hand-to-hand combat, two well-dressed guys walk up and knock Porter unconscious. They drag him off to another car and drive away, leaving a bewildered Pearl beside herself on the street.27. Two little piggies.The thugs who grabbed Porter are Fairfax's men whom have apparently followed him from the mansion. Porter is tied to a chair in a warehouse and gets punched and beaten by Fairfax's thugs to try to get him to tell them where he is holding Bronson's son, Johnny. Porter, despite being worked over, refuses to talk. Just then Bronson and his head thug arrive. Too late now, Fairfax tells Porter. Bronson throws a small black duffel bag with Porter's money to the floor.Here's the 130 thousand. That's as close as you'll ever get to it. Bronson tells Porter that he intends to kill him anyway since no one takes on him or his Outfit. Porter is too worked over and beaten to correct Bronson that he only wants $70,000. Bronson offers to kill Porter quick in exchange for telling him where Johnny is, and threatens several weeks torture if he doesn't. Bronson's henchman begins to smash Porter's toes with a hammer. After smashing two, the in-agony Porter relents and gives them an address to where Johnny is. A suspicious Bronson tells Porter: You'll understand if I don't entirely trust you. They put him in the trunk of Bronson's limo and drive off to the address Porter gave them.28. Another wrong number.That evening, the limo pulls up outside an apartment. Inside the trunk, Porter struggles with his hands tied behind him. Five men get out of car, including Fairfax and Bronson, who tells two of the thugs to watch the front entrance while he, Fairfax and his lead henchman will go to the apartment to look for Johnny.As Porter struggles, Bronson, Fairfax, and the other henchman climb stairs. Rosie is seen in the apartment smoking a cigarette, with Johnny handcuffed to the radiator, watched by the dog.Porter frees his hands.The two men at front entrance light cigarettes.Porter finds a tire lever.The three men walk along a corridor.Porter pierces the back seat, gets his hands through. Porter gets through back seat and inside the car. He reaches for the car phone and dials just as the three men reach the apartment door. Bronson, his henchman, and Fairfax kick in door, guns in hand. Porter finishes dialing.The phone rings in the apartment (Porter's apartment) as the men discover the place is empty. Bronson answers the phone. Porter says into the phone: You were right not to trust me. The bomb under the bed explodes, apparently killing Bronson, Fairfax, and the other henchman. The force of the explosion blows down the other two henchmen outside the apartment building as well as blows out the side windows of the limo. Porter sees the keys in the ignition. Porter also sees the black duffel bag with the $130,000 cash in the front passenger seat. He gets in the front seat, starts the car and drives away.29. Aiming high?Inside another apartment, Rosie hears a car horn. She looks out the window. Porter is standing beside her car after driving up in the damaged limo. Rosie gets the dog. (It's been fun... See you later.) She leaves behind Johnny who is still handcuffed.Outside in the street, she asks, What took you so long? Rosie puts her luggage in the car trunk and her dog in the back seat as Porter gets in the front passenger seat. Rosie gets in the car and sees Porter's bloodied and bruised face and asks What happened to you?I got hammered, Porter says as he smiles properly for the first time.

title: Poklosie
synopsis: Aftermath (Poklosie) is a fictionalized movie about actual events. It is in Polish with English subtitles.Franek Kalina (Ireneusz Czop) and Jozek (Maciej Stuhr) Kalina, sons of a poor farmer, are brothers from a small village in central Poland. Franek immigrated to the United States in the 80s, and cut all ties with his family. Only when Jozeks wife Jola arrives in the US, without explanation, does Franek finally return to his homeland. (from movie website)The film starts with Franek's flight into Warsaw. He takes a taxi to the train. He tells the taxi driver that Poles have a hard time in America. Carrying only a duffle bag, he just catches the train, then the bus to his rural home. Its just after sunset.Franek walks on a road toward the farmhouse, but hears noises that seem to follow him in the woods along the road. He puts his bag down and goes into the woods to see what it is, but cannot find anything. Franek hits his head on a low branch, knocking him out for a while. He wakes up to find his bag gone, along with his two cartons of cigarettes and clothes. The police chief, Sgt. Nowak, (Zbigniew Zamachowski) stops by to give him a ride to the house, but is not much help.Franek finds the farmhouse pretty much dark and locked. His brother Jozek comes out of the house carrying an ax. When he sees who it is, they embrace. Once in the farmhouse, Franek notices that little has changed since he left 20 years ago. They make small talk, then Franek asks why his wife Jola and the kids left, insinuating that he must have abused them. Jozek reacts angrily, saying he doesn't know why. He then turns the tables, accusing him of leaving the family in the lurch when Jozek was just a kid and his father disabled. Franek says that is ancient history, but then a rock is thrown into the kitchen window to prove him wrong.The next day, the brothers go to the cemetery by the church to visit their parents graves, Stanislaw and Jadwiga Kalinas. Franek, who left Poland as an oppressive Communist regime was coming to power, did not attend the funerals of his parents because he was afraid the authorities would take his passport and he would not be allowed to go back to his family in America and maybe arrested. Jozek criticizes Franek again for his non-attendance, saying again he believes his parents knew and would have disapproved.On the way out of the graveyard, the new local priest Fr. Pawlek (Andrzej Mastalerz) stops Jozek, who tells the priest, I'm taking them all this week. Fr. Pawlek retorts, This isn't over yet. If God won't set things right, the parish will. Come to your senses! Franek lights a votive candle and places it on the headstone of his parents.Franek goes to a local store to get a newspaper, meeting neighbors Sudecki (Ryszard Ronczewski) and his two sons. After some small talk, the older man tells Franek he should take his brother Jozek to America, like brothers do. Franek replies that Jozek does not want to go and that America is a young man's land. The Sudecki brothers reinforce their belief that Jozek needs to leave and be with his wife and children.Sgt. Novak spots Franek and offers to get his police report. Franek asks him if his brother is liked in town, to which Novak says, Have you been drunk outside the store today? The older priest, the Rector, (Jerzy Radziwilowicz) arrives and Novak leaves. A younger officer shows Franek a complaint against Jozek for damaging the old tannery road. Some people wanted to hang Jozek, the officer said, but Novak prevented them from doing it.Franek walks back home and a community nurse, Justyna, (Zuzana Fialová) stops to pick him up. She is the granddaughter of Sudecki. She knows Jola and the kids from the clinic and wonders how they are doing in Chicago. She also denies knowing why Jola left. Franek asks her to drive him by the old tannery road, where it appears that many large paving stones had been removed from the low spot in front of the tannery. He tries to go into the tannery itself, but the fence is locked and is overgrown with vegetation.Back on the farm, Franek helps his brother shred straw. He mentions to Jozek that he needs to go to Gurowka, the nearest large town, to get replacement clothes because of his stolen duffle. Jozek says he needs to go to town too and would go with him. Franek makes a couple of attempts at asking why he took the paving stones, but Jozek dodges them. Franek tells his brother that he works on demolition crews, often the removal of asbestos in Chicago, complaining that the Jews have the construction market cornered. He said the Jews hire others to do the dirty work, especially the asbestos because it can cause cancer. Jozek criticizes Franek again about not being there for their parents funeral, blaming him for their death. Jozek then walks off in a huff.The next day, the brothers go to the bank, where Jozek is told his application for a loan has been denied because of irregularities in the title to the land. The bank had made loans before, but won't now. The Kalinas had gotten the land in the Agrarian Reform after the war, but the municipal office where the records were was closed. Franek went to check the hours they were open while Jozek went to a bar for a drink. By the time Franek gets to the bar, four lumberjacks had accosted Jozek and beaten him up, leaving the bar a bloody mess. The barmaid was tending Jozek in the alley in the rear.The brothers take the bus back to their village and Jozek offers to show him why he took the paving stones. They walk to a wheat field toward the rear of their 15 acre field along the woods, where Jozek had erected dozens of Jewish headstones like a cemetery. He denied knowing why he had done it, telling Franek it seemed like the right thing to do. He tells him that the seldom-used tannery road was put into use after a flood washed out the main road, exposing the headstones. Jozek removed them from the road base, angering the neighbors. Others he admitted to buying at up to 300 zloty each. The total monuments altogether, Franek calculated to be worth about 70,000 zloty. Jozek continued, saying he taught himself Hebrew so that he could read the headstones, though he acknowledged people in the village thought he was nuts. Jozek said his wife Jola felt the same as the neighbors, but he felt it was very wrong of the Germans to use the Jewish headstone to pave the road as well as other purposes. When the neighbors wanted to cover up the road to make it smoother, Jozek said, No way! I'm taking the stones.Jozek told Franek he had found out that some of the stones had been used at the church and he had talked to the older Rector, who gave him permission to remove them when the time is right. Franek says he fears it will end in tears and asks why he has to do it. Jozek told him, Because there is no one else to look after them.Franek washes his clothes in a washbowl, then goes back to the village store. While he is there, the lumberjacks come looking for Jozek Kalinas place. The Sudecki sons were there, but did not tell where it was, suggesting somewhere else. Franek notices and thanks them. Franek goes to the rectory to talk to the Rector, who has known the Kalinas family for the last 30 years. The Rector acknowledges he has given Jozek permission, but also knows of the many who are upset. He was going to give a sermon, but hoped it would blow over, that there would be a good time to do it. Franek says he doesn't think there will ever be a good time to remove the stones.After leaving the soon-to-retire Rector, the one to be in charge soon, Fr. Pawlek, stops Franek, saying that any removal of the stones must be done peacefully, so that the media will not be snooping around, you know what I mean. Franek denies knowing what he means, so Fr. Pawlek asks him to talk to the congregation and he'd find out. They're my flock now, including the [lumberjacks] from the sawmill.After he gets back to the farm, Franek asks how to get to Gurowka on Sunday when the bus isn't running. Jozek tells him that the only way is by farm tractor. Franek tells Jozek that he worked out a plan with the Rector to remove the church stones, but needs Jozek to be somewhere else when it happens. Jozek refuses to go along, saying that would be chickening out. Franek drives the tractor into town, but is followed by an aqua 72 Ford Granada. Franek stops the tractor and scares them off, then continues.Once in town, Franek gets his clothes, then sees Justyna from the clinic. He asks her about procedures when they need a priest for last rites for the very sick, under various circumstances. Franek takes his new clothes and goes home, but again the Ford Granada buzzes him, causing him to lose his clothes, which are promptly run over by the bus. The Granada gets away.Back home, Franek asks Jozek about the Granada, but Jozek doesn't know much about cars. He's more concerned with the wheat harvester he has rented to reap his wheat crop at 4am the next morning. However, in the middle of the night, the two brothers take the tractor and a rented trailer to the church, call in an emergency for the new priest and wait for him to leave. When he does, they go into the churchyard and begin gathering the Jewish headstones being used around the well. However, a crowd of angry parishioners waits for them at the gate with pitchforks. One of the crowd accuses the brothers of being Jews who are stealing church property, but the Rector awakens and comes out to defend the Kalinas brothers, telling them he had personally given permission and paid for the rental of the trailer. He went on to say that the stones had been placed there unlawfully and it was time they went back to where they belong. The Rector tells the mob that the Kalinas are Polish and good Christians too. He then tells Sudecki and his son they will fry in hell because they no longer came to church.One in the mob cried out that the Jews killed Our Lord, and Jozek was standing up for the Jews. The Rector told them he was in charge and they should go home or come into the church to pray. Many apparently believed the new priest, Fr. Pawlek, that the Rector had been bamboozled and was out of his mind. The crowd makes a path for the tractor and the brothers take the headstones from the church to their field to put up with the others. After setting the new stones, the sleepy brothers think they hear something in the woods, especially when Franek finds some of his empty cigarette cases.They get little sleep, as the wheat harvester is supposed to be coming at 4am; it doesn't arrive. They bike off to the village to find out why, but the belligerent manager tells them it had broken down. They do not believe him because it isn't in the shop. The brothers tell him that they had seen the harvester in another field on their way into the village. The manager tells them he is in charge and can do what he believes is right. Later, when the brother accost the machine operator, he tells the bothers he goes where he is told. The landowner orders them off his property and not to bother the operator.Jozek heads back to his Jewish cemetery in the wheat field while Franek heads into the village to check into the discrepancy with the land title. After looking and comparing documents, Franek learns that his dad got title to their farm after the war, but he didn't own it before the war. Before the war, it belonged to a Jewish farmer, Abraham Wimelman. The land actually owned before the war by Stanislaw Kalinas was in a marsh near a bend in the river. They learn that there were 26 farms that had new owners after the war, all previously owned by Jewish farmers who disappeared, including all of the Kalinas' immediate neighbors. Sudecki lives on land owned by Shalom Prinek. Malinowski lives on land previously owned by Izaac Goldberg. Sgt Novak's land was previously owned by Simon Hirschbaum. The headstones of these previous owners are in Jozeks makeshift cemetery. The clerk noted that these farmers had taken land owned by murdered Jews, all of them. Their title was granted after the war by the Agrarian Reform. When Franek asked why, the clerk countered,What do you expect? The Germans couldn't take it with them and after the war, there was no one left to claim the farms.Franek rides his bike home and almost gets run over by the Ford Granada. Upon arrival at the Kalinas home, he finds that anti-Semitic graffiti had been spray painted all over the house and barns, and the family dog had been killed, his head cut with a scythe. Jozek comes back, sees the damage, and they bury the dog.Franek helps his brother sharpen the tractor mower to cut down the wheat, old style, having given up on the harvester coming by anytime soon. While preparing the mower, he tells Jozek about how their father got the land they have now. The present farm does belong to them, but not to their grandfather, who owned two lots over by the river bend. Jozek thought their land had belonged to Koscielski, who had fled to America, like Franek. Franek replied that before the war, only the land by the river bend was theirs, but this land belonged to Jewish farmers. Franek told Jozek that after the Germans killed the Jews, our people took their homes and land. All the reform did was round everything off so everyone got about 5 hectares (abt. 15 acres). There were 26 families and about 100 people. Franek asked Jozek if he understood. The neighbors were scared heirs would find out about it and want their land back. In the old days, Franek said, the farmers would send their dogs after the Jews, but now the law's on their side and there are documents in the archive to prove it. Since they were small landowners the reform wouldn't have touched them, he said. Under communism, people would have been too scared to reclaim the land; now, the Jews don't know that their families once lived here: that's why the people don't take kindly to Jozek.They take the mower and start cutting the wheat down. Franek comments that it is good to work for yourself, and not some ass in the city.Later, they go to their grandfather's land by the river bend. They talk about who among their neighbors might remember the occupation. One was an old lady, Old Palka, probably now around 100 and in a nursing home. Malinowski, (Robert Rogalski) now about 90, and Sudecki, who was around 80. The Malinowskis are quiet and pretty private. Old Palka is probably crazy by now. Franek comments that People in America keep saying the Poles denounced Jews to the Germans, Jews in particular. They find the fireplace and stone remains of what must have been a fire.Franek goes home after a long day, washing his shirt again, then going to sleep. But it wasn't long and the brothers were awakened by light in the window that turns out to be their wheat crop set on fire. They try to put it out, but it is too big. The fire department comes and could have put it out, but claims it is too late and they are making sure nobody else's crops are burnt. Jozek is frantic because his Jewish headstones are in the field and the firemen won't help. Jozek becomes belligerent and takes a swing at the reluctant fire chief and the brothers are both beaten and arrested. Both spent the night in jail.The Kalinas are in jail, beaten, their home vandalized and their pet killed. The Rector comes from the church and gets them released, taking them to the rectory to get cleaned up. The brothers tell the story of the land thefts to the Rector, who is shocked, as nothing was ever written down about it, probably since the Police chief is one of the landowners involved. Franek is confused, because much smaller crimes against the Jews were investigated, but this one was never even recorded. They certainly would have investigated 26 families and 100 people killed, especially with witnesses around. Justyna arrives from the clinic to help, but instead Franek prevails upon her to drive them to visit her grandfather.They first see Mrs. Palka, (Robert Rogalski) now a patient at the clinic. She remembers Franek after he reminds her that, as a child, he stole two rabbits from her because he didn't want them to be killed and eaten. Mrs. Palka remembers Abraham, a handsome young man, whom many of the Polish girls liked. [Cut to Jozek in the field cleaning off Abraham's headstone.] She said the Germans came and made the Jews disappear at the beginning of the war, around 1941. She did not know what happened or how, just that they were gone. She mentioned the Perlman boy, but was coy about what happened to him. It appears that her family might have hidden him for a while, but The Germans got him too, she said, People talk, you don't even know how mean people are. They'll say anything as long as it suits them. Saying I sold moonshine and all. Maybe I did and maybe I didn't. They can't prove it, but I never sold out any Jews, like the others.Then the nurse drove Franek to see her grandfather, old Suds Sudecki, and his sons. They had been in town when Franek first arrived and in the crowd at the church when they were removing the headstones from the church well. Sudecki is pretty cagy, and doesn't engage at first, but does admit that he wasn't born at their present farm, but was born over by the river, just like their dad, Stanislaw. He then tells Franek if he wants to know anything, he should ask around his own house. Sud's son and grandson see he is upset and force the Kalinas to leave.Franek leaves to their nearby field, finding Jozek continuing to work on removing the soot from the headstones caused by the fire. Franek tells him what he learned from old Palka and the Rector, that there were no records of deportations. He mentions the odd thing that Sudecki had told him, if he wants to know more, to ask around their own house. They talk about going to their old house by the river, thinking maybe the Jews are still there.Spoiler textIn the middle of the night they go to the old house and start digging.[The Rector is shown having a heart attack in the rectory, following the fire and the unreported land thefts.]At first the brothers dig up watery soil, but then start digging up skulls and other human bones. They dig all night. In the morning they are trying to figure out what to do next when an old woman comes out of the woods. She says, Found them at last, poor souls. Why don't you bury them in the graveyard you made? They talk to her, and she tells them that she lives in the woods and has all these years. She was there, along with many others, when the Jews were rounded up, and herded into the Kalinas cottage, then set it on fire, laughing and drinking vodka. They yelled, That's for Jesus on the cross! Franek asked if they were soldiers. The old woman said the Germans came the first couple of days, talked to Malinowski, then left. Weren't no Germans hereabouts, she said,it was the whole village. Was Malinowski who set the fire himself, along with another fellow. She said she cried out for them to let them go, but they called her a bitch and threatened to throw her into the fire too. She decided she wanted to live and stopped. She apparently has lived in the forest ever since.Franek and Jozek march over to the Malinowski home and find the aqua Ford Grenada in a shed. The 90-year-old comes out to talk to them. They tell him they have dug up the bones of the murdered Jews and accuse him of lighting the fire. He blows them off. The Kalinas push, asking if it wasn't him, who was it? Jozek tells him that nobody has said anything for 60 years and that everybody deserves a proper burial: They may not be Christian, but they got a right to a grave. Malinowski echoes Franek's earlier sentiment that the dead don't care where they lie. Jozek retorts, that he is wrong because their sons care.Franek accuses Malinowski again. He responds that the Krauts did all kinds of things. Jozek accused Malinowski of rounding up the Jews and taking them to the Kalinas house and burning them. When Malinowski said that was more than one person could do, Jozek said the whole village helped him. They reminded him that he's 90 and might die soon and that confession is good for the soul. Malinowski gets upset even more when accused of murdering his neighbors, saying saying he didn't kill neighbors. Then he said the fire was started on two sides of the cottage and it was their father on the other side. He stares angrily at them, telling them to bury them back and let them lie. Jozek almost loses it, not wanting to believe his father helped start the fire and Franek has to hold him back. Then Malinowski tells the brothers their dad had a crush on a Jewish girl Halszka Mintz. Stanislaw chased her, grabbed her hair, and smashed her head on the ground, repeatedly. He later cut her head off and kicked it along the roadside, all because she wouldn't have sex with him. Malinowski glares at the brothers, then asks, Is that what you want to tell people? Disgusted, they leave.On the way home, Franz finds his duffle bag, along with a couple of the 20 cigarette packs he had originally. He cleans his clothes again. They think about what they have learned, then come together to discuss it. Franek suggests they bury the bones in the new cemetery plot in the burnt wheat field. Jozek is getting cold feet, now concerned that it will all come out to the authorities, the papers, and the whole country. Franek agrees, saying he knows the Chicago Jews will not let it go and for 20 generations, people will remember our village, Malinowski and our father. That's their right and our hope. Maybe the likes of our father won't be seen again. Jozek disagrees and wants to put the bones back where they found them and forget it, saying nobody will know. Franek said that I know this world is a lousy shithole and we can't make it one bit better, but, you know what? We won't make it any worse.Jozek throws a fit, denying that Franek is his brother. He tells Franek he renounced him when he left 20 years ago. Father cursed you and nobody even spoke your name all these years. Mother cried her eyes out for you in secret, scared to admit it. My brother died in 1980. Get out of my house! Franek stares at him as he says,I'm your brother! but Jozek hits him and a full-blown knock-down fight ensues. Franek gets his stuff and leaves for the bus.At the bus stop, Franek sees anti-Jewish graffiti and he kicks out the panel, just as the bus stops to pick him up. He rides for a while, then a truck passes the bus and blocks the road ahead. It is driven by Justyna, the nurse, who wants Franek to come with her. Franek asks, Josek? She nods. They drive back to the Kalinas farm to find a crowd of people and the police. As Franek walks through the crowd, they part and let him through to the barn. Jozek was found beaten, stabbed, and then nailed high on the inside of the barn door, his arms outstretched. His wrists and feet were held by wooden cleats. Someone in the crowd yelled that it was a suicide just like Judas.The final scene unfolds years later. Franek is in a nice suit and walks from the woods to the wheat field, now a Jewish cemetery. A tour bus is there and a Jewish prayer service is going on. There is a monument commemorating the tragedy. Franek watches solemnly, then reaches into his pocket, retrieving a votive candle. He lights it and places it on top of one of the Jewish headstones.The end.

title: Maniac
synopsis: (00:00) The film starts with a written introduction: FOREWORD: The brain, in and of its physical self, does not think any more than a musical instrument can give forth melody without the touch of the musicians hand. The brain is indeed the instrument of thinking, but the mind is the skilful player that makes it give forth the beautiful harmony of thought It is because of the disastrous results of fear brought not only on the individual but on the nation, that it becomes the duty of every sane man and woman to establish quarantine against fear. Fear is a psychic disease which is highly contagious and extraordinarily infectious. Fear thought is most dangerous when it parades as forethought. Combat fear by replacing it with faith. Resist worry with confidence. --- Wm. S. Sadler, M.D., F.A.C.S., Director of the Chicago Institute of Research and Diagnosis. [William Samuel Sadler (1875-1969), American medicine doctor as psychologist, psychiatrist and surgeon at Chicago for over 60 years, teacher of Psychology at the McCormick Theological Seminary.] Unhealthy thought creates harped attitudes which in turn create criminals and manias. The Chicago Crime Commission made a survey of 10.000 (exact number impossible to read in the video copy; possibly higher multiple of 10.000) convicted criminals and found them all suffering from some mental disease.(02:20) In a laboratory, Dr. Mierschultz (HORACE CARPENTER) is putting his finishing touches to some chemical mix in a big hypodermic syringe, while his assistant is doing some electric experiences on a strange apparatus. Tonight, my dear Maxwell, I'm ready to try my experiement on a human. Yeah In the morgue, there is a little guest suicide. Maxwell (BILL WOODS aka William Woods) is obviously distressed, Have you made arrangements?
The Doctor is taken aback: No! You know that I do not work under prying eyes! You shall find a way for me to work without detection. It is your chance to show me your gratitude for my generosity, and protection!
Maxwell stands up, towering over the sitting Doctor: I'll never forget what you have done, and I'd do anything to help you - but the morgue! Dead people! What if I should be caught?
The Doctor almost spits his answer: How many times have you told me of your impersonations, that you never had a chance!... May be now your art will serve you, after all! You have seen the Coroner, why not impersonate him? That's it! Impersonate him! The time has come when you can repay me for what I have done.
Maxwell tries to plead, but at the same time he voices his disapproval for the old Doctor's experiments: To bring back life is not natural, he says he has arranged for other guinea-pigs, a dog, and a cat. Satan, the black cat, snarls from his pillow, as on cue.
Once a ham, always a ham! [meaning, an actor who overacts in a bad way] You, an actor? (derisive smile) But dont forget, my dear Maxwell, the police would be very glad to find you.
Maxwell looks up at the ceiling, I didn't mean I wouldn't... Of course not. In time, you may become a great man!
Both men strip their long white shifts, and leave the laboratory. Satan the black cat is seen on the basement running after a rat, and then a lonely ginger cat.(05:17) At the morgue, Maxwell in disguise with a monocle, accompanies the undisguised Doctor in the search for a human corpse.
The Doctor chooses the body of a beautiful young blonde, This is the one here! he says, uncovering her head.
Maxwell reads from a plate on the corpses wrist, Number 5-6-9-4-1, Maria Altura (Uncredited), 24, suicide, carbon monoxide gas, not clean.
The doctor checks for a heart bit with a stetoscope, then applies an injection in both carotids. We have to work fast, he says.
In the next room, the Embalmer (J.P. WADE) and his Assistant (Uncredited) are complaining that with so many deaths, and suicides yet, they have to work overtime.
The Doctor massages the body's cold arms, and the girl starts moving her head a little. The Doctor decides she must have some oxygen, so they'll bring her outside through a side door.
The Embalmer comments to his Assistant that the Coroner is making extra working hours, performing an autopsy on the beauty that had been brought in earlier [insinuating an act of necrophilia].(08:45) At the Bureau of Missing Persons, Captain Jones is hearing the deposition of the baldhead Embalmer and the Coroner (BILL WOODS in a double role, Uncredited), about the disappearance of Maria's body; the Embalmer gives a description resembling Dr. Meirschultz. The Coroner admits that the Doctor is a bit strange, but denies the possibibility of him being a body snatcher. Meanwhile, the police receives an official inquest on the whereabouts of Don Maxwell, a vaudeville impersonator by profession, who has disappeared in town. Detective Collins (Uncredited) is put in charge of the case.At the laboratory, Dr. Meirschultz is waiting for Maria to recover fully in a few hours. While his assistant is overly impressed with giving back life to a dead person, the Doctor says, This is but one step. Cases like these have an element of doubt, but what I want is a victim with a shattered heart! Yes! A heart (There is a pulsating heart, kept in a large bowel on the labs main desk.) - that I may exchange for this thing I've been keeping for years. Ah! Ah! Ah! You! You shall bring it to me, Maxwell. It will be my supreme accomplishment!
The assistant cowers again at the idea, Not from the morgue!...
But the Doctor is relentless, I dont care where you take it from the morgue, the streets, the undertaker! Get going! The end will justify the means.
(13:25) Maxwell goes out, rampages through a tunnel into the undertaker's office (looking like the laboratory's basement). Two ginger snarling cats are there fighting (apparently tied to each other by a piece of string). One cat darts between Maxwell's legs, frightening him so that he runs away by the front door. As he runs through a green park, he passes by a white dog versus a black cat fighting on the road.
(14:05) At first, the doctor is displeased on the assistants failure, Coward! You are a fool! You've failed me. But then, looking at the throbbing heart in the glass jar, he has an idea. He takes a revolver from a drawer, and says, Yeah! You have seen the extent of my powers; you have worked with me; you have faith in me. Here, take this (he hands the revolver to him). You'll take your own life, and I'll give it back to you. I'll give you the new heart, and you'll live again. Ah! Ah! Ah! You'll live!... Ah! Ah! Ah! Live!... The assistant shoots. The revolver falls. Dr. Meirschultz hangs briefly to the table, than falls on the floor, dead.(16:05) DEMENTIA PRAECOX is the next films title, describing the most important of the psychosis, both because it constitutes the highest percentage of mental diseases and because recovery is so extremely rare. Dementia praecox patients show blunting of the emotions, serious defects of judgement, development of fantastic ideas, belief that they are being forced to do things or are being interfered with. [Dementia praecox (precocious madness) is a term first used in 1891 in this Latin form by Arnold Pick (1851-1924), a German professor of psychiatry at Charles University in Prague.]Maxwell inspects the doctors notes, to find the formula to bring him back to life, only to find there is none. [Montage of a laughing Pluto and his minions, from the film _Maciste in Hell (1924)_ (qv).] Mrs. Buckley (PHYLLIS DILLER, 1897-1972; not the TV comedienne 1917-... who has a longer nose, and a much longer career) comes for urgent consultation with the doctor, for her husband is having a delusion of being a killer ape. She is prepared to wait, but demands to see the doctor. Maxwell, under strain and not wishing to give away his crime, turns to his old box of Make-up Artist, adds a wig and the doctors eye-glasses, and comes to a resolution: Meirschultz would be missed - Maxwell never would! So, he impersonates the Doctor (figuratively commiting the suicide the Doctor had ordered him to do).
Maxwell talking in a strong voice, tries to convince himself of the perfect impersonation: Not only do I look like Meirschultz, I am doctor Meirschultz! (bulging his biceps) I'll be a great man!(21:50) APARESIS is the general paralysis of the insane the most serious disorder for the criminologist. There is marked failure of memory, poor retention, impaired judgement, and failure on the part of the patient to curb his primitive tendencies. -- according to a text quoted from Philip A. Parsons, Ph.D., Crime and Criminal.As Maxwell progresses in his insanity, he is unable to cope with the injection he is preparing in the lab for Mr. Buckley (TED EDWARDS) who fancies himself as a killer ape; instead of giving him an injection of water, which would do no harm (?!), he administers a dose of super-adrenaline. Do you feel better? he asks.
Mr. Buckley contorts himself in pain, speaking out his suffering and twisting his body, feeling fire in his brain. The wife is worried, Doctor - he doesn't seem to be getting better, but worse! and, Doctor, what was in that hypo?
Buckley frightens his wife, who tumbles into the laboratory, then he jumps at the fake doctor, overpowering him and throwing him to the ground easily despite being a smaller man.
Maria Altura, in a long, white negligee, walks in from behind a folding screen, and is immediately abducted.
Mrs. Buckley, trying to raise from the floor, sees the late Meirschultz's corpse hid behind the desk, and shouts, Doctor! What have you done? This looks like murder!...
He denies, and tries to convince her that it was his assistant who had shot himself. But then, he commits a lapsus linguae, and says that he killed him to bring him back to life with his experiments.
(27:30) Meanwhile, Maria Altura is being stripped to the waist in an apparent swoon, as Mr. Buckley keeps walking through a wood, screeching like an ape. [The topless stand-in is a brunette with very long hair.]
Mrs. Buckley sums the situation up: Doctor, I've heard of uncanny experiments but this tops them all. But I think we speak the same language... Am I right? When youll bring your assistant back to life, he will do as you direct. You can do the same with my husband. Only he will do... as I direct.
(28:32) In the woods, Buckley is upon his victim, apparently strangling her to death, or worse.
Maxwell decides he must bring the real doctor back, but first, he has to find out the formula.
Maxwell is distracted again, this time by his Neighbor (Uncredited), a man who was calling after two of his cats that had escaped from the house. Maxwell denies using cats for his experiments, stating, I think too much of Satan to use cats for experiments.Meanwhile, in the laboratory, Satan had got out of his favourite pillow, overturned the jar, and eaten the heart [in a heavily cut scene]. Maxwell is undecided about his priorities, and now decides to dispose of the body. He carries the corpse downstairs to the basement. While he works feverishly to hide the corpse behind a wall of bricks, he sees Satan spying on him from the stairs, and chases the cat mounting the steps cat-like. Finally he corners Satan, grabs forcefully at the animals head and pressing with his thumbs, he dislodges the cats left eyeball.
(32:02) [The stand-in cat for Satan is the ginger cat seen earlier, who had been a one-eyed cat before this scene.] Once free, the stand-in cat jumps against a glass window, breaking it, and disappears.
When Maxwell looks down and finds the cat's eyeball on the ground, he compares it to an oyster, or a grape, But the gleam is gone! Ah! Ah! Ah! And eats it. Then, he returns to the basement, and finishes sealing Dr. Meirschultz's body inside the brick wall of his basement.(32:55) PARANOIAC This is an extremely rare but very serious disease. Characteristics of it are fixed suspicions, persecutory delusions. The paranoiac is often particularly dangerous because of the difficulty of detecting his disease.Distracted by his inner phantasms, Maxwell stops adding bricks to the wall for a moment, just in time for Satan to dart inside, joining his late owner. Next morning, Detective Collins is the neighbourhood asking questions, first from a Woman sweeping her frontporch, and then a Man who has a cat breeding farm; nothing useful comes out of it, except that shots were heard but were not reported, and that may be they were not heard at all.
Cat Breeder Neighbor: I have everything figured out. You see, rats breed faster than cats; cats skins make good furs; cats eats rats; and rats eat raw meat; but that means they eat the carcass of the cats. So, the rats eat the cats, the cats eat the rats, and I get the skins...
Detective Collins: Rats eating cats! Well, that IS news.
Cat Breeder Neighbor: (Gleeful) Simple ain't it...
Detective: Did you hear any gunshots last night? Cat Breeder Neighbor: I dunno...(36:15) Maxwell had forgotten all about his wife, and her, him - until...
This films inter-title introduces a living room with three young women in various degrees of undress, plus Maizie (JENNY DARK), a blonde who wants to be clean, and is taking her time in the adjoining bathroom. Alice Maxwell (THEO RAMSEY) is a plump silver blonde who rents the apartment (and looks and speaks like Mae West); Jo (CELIA McCANN) is a pretty, long haired brunette with a funny, shrill voice; and Marvel (MARVEL ANDRE) is a beautiful young blonde, in knickers and skin-colour bra, doing gymnastics. The brunette is ironing some underwear, Alice takes off her dark robe and is using an electric equipment to massage her buttocks and belly, while Maizie who had changed her bath towel for a flimsy negligee sits, reading the newspaper. Then, Maizie reads from the newspaper that some man died in Australia, living a fortune to his nephew, Maxwell, a well known impersonator artist who has disappeared. With good reason, Alice remembers her fugitive husband, and that the last she heard of him, he was staying with that good professor...
[There's a cut scene, in which detective Collins informs Mrs. Buckley that her husband has been found in a very serious condition, near a dying woman, and that Dr. Meirschultz is suspect of wrong doing. She tells a false story about what had taken place at the laboratory, covering up both for her husband, and for the Doctor.]
(39:45) Alice goes to Dr. Meirschultz's and is received by her husband in disguise; she tells him that Maxwell has inherited a fortune, and she wants to reunite with him. He dismisses her, saying that her husband will be there by 8 p.m.(40:20) MANIC DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSIS is the lead of the next piece of scientific text. There are three phases of the manic-depressive psychosis: the manic phase, the depressed phase, and the mixed phase. In the manic phase, ideas come so rapidly that there is no time to select the proper reaction and judgement accordingly appears impaired. Such patients are often liable to commit sex offenses.There's a moment of fantasy, in which the false Doctor fancies to be kissing a young, long haired Brunette Patient, who had come to him for an injection. She is seen wearing only large cotton knickers, peering from behind a folding screen; and then, sitting on a table covered with a white bedshit, incongruously wrapped up in a black negligee. [She is the stand-in for Maria Altura in the rape scene.]
Next, Don Maxwell (WILLIAM WOODS), speaking to himself, is fascinated with the gleam in the Patient's eyes, and he recalls the gleam in Mrs. Buckley's eyes, and concludes that it means she wanted to kill her husband. The same gleam in Alice's eyes means that she wanted to kill him, when she came searching for Maxwell. She wants to murder me thats what she wants to do! (The long clawed hands of Pluto and other devils reappear in an insert, superimposed to the scene.) He forms a plan to get rid of both women.He starts by telling Mrs. Buckley (PHYLLIS DILLER) that she must help him, that Mrs. Maxwell (THEA RAMSEY) is crazy, and shell be here any minute. She thinks I murdered her husband! To prevent her from goping to the police with such an accusation, he needs help. Down in the basement, there is a secret vault! We will put her down there. You will quieten her by jabbing this in her arm (placing an hypodermic syringe in Mrs. Buckleys right hand), and in the meantime, I'll go get Buckley.
It sounds alright - except the fact that she's crazy, objects Buckley's wife.
Foot steps announce the approaching Alice Maxwell, and the false doctor dismisses the woman's objection lightly, sending her to the next room.
In his interview with Alice, Maxwell tells her that her husband told him he was ready to go with her to get the inheritance, but first there is a dangerous woman in the bext room, who puts both their lives in danger. I will take her to a room downstairs, I will give her a shot, and you'll take care of her until Im back.
What about me getting help? (listening) She is quiet now, isn't she?
Maxwell cuts in, Yeah, but she can break up any minute. She is not afraid of a woman, so if she happens to get wild, just shove this into her arm. (placing an hypodermic needle in her hand) Keep it, and all will be well.
Maxwell puts his hands on his wife's shoulder, as he walks her to the adjoining room. He enters first, and says in an unnecessary high voice: Alright, Mrs. Buckley. We'll go downstairs now, I've a special treatment down there!...
The fortyish woman goes in front, wearing long coat and a design hat, plus a fox fur wrapped around her neck and a large ring in her middle finger, followed shortly by Alice, wearing dark jacket and long skirt and a hat. They had not time to see each other, and as they go down the staircase to the basement, Mrs. Buckley, turns around a couple of times trying to see the twenty-something woman behind her. Her husband follows her, but then he quickly turns back, closing the trap door on both women, who suddenly find themselves in the dark basement, alone with a candle light and a couple of rats.(45:45m) Fear leads them to lose control, and to attack each other wildly. The screaming will be heard all through the entire sequence, and despite they are closed in a basement without walls, the noise can be heard in the laboratory, too. Mrs. Buckley screams, and turns around, hitting Mrs. Maxwells arm, who loses her syringe that rolls between the feet of the entangled pair. Alice jumps at the other woman, grabbing her arms and making her lose her hold in her own hypo. [The syringes with the deadly venom will be seen occasionally on the floor, but never re-taken.] They shove each other around, then Alice tries to strangle the older woman.
Upstairs, Maxwell is going even more mad, and laughing maniacally (insert images of clawed hands reappear).
The Cat Breeder Neigbor comes to spy through a window, and disappears in fear of the look on the false doctors face.
Alice goes down on her rump, but as she is grabbing her attackers arms, she has the leverage to get up on the rebound as Buckley stands back. Alice throws down Buckleys wife, and looks for some kind of weapon in the filthy basement, plunged into darkness, and rat infested. The older woman is fast to get up, and goes after Alice, who turns around to face her foe. Face to face, they grab each others by the neck, strangling each other. In the fierce struggle, both disentangle their necks, and slap each other to face and body. The older woman wrestles Alice down, and pulls her jacket, effectively stripping it off the jacket of the blonde, leaving her in a white shirt, that she rips with her clawing fingers. Alice goes down twice, and stands up again, her breathing hard, coming to hands again with the other woman. This time, Alice sprangs up from the floor, and the two women engage in a double head-lock, going down together, first hard, on their knees, then twisting sideways, slumping to the floor in a close embrace, and rolling around for a moment. Alice seems to dominate the fight, staying on top for a moment, and punching her foe twice. she forces Mrs. Buckley in a tight clinch, both grabbing the opponents neck to breaking point, and tumble and roll entwined and screeching. Alice disengages, and applies a couple of punches to the fallen foe.In the night, three cops on motorcycles precede a 1927 Studebaker Commander police car, all sirens on - possibly called by the curious neighbour.
In the down and dirty room, the two women keep on their fight; Alice shoves Buckley onto her back against some boxes in a corner, punches her and, as Buckley screams out in pain and disoriented, Alice gets a baseball bat from behind her, and bashes it onto Mrs. Buckleys head - missing, and hitting the wall instead. The second blow is more effective, but delivered by a very tired arm. (Insert of a flying pidgeon.) Buckley manages to stand-up and punch Alice, who falls against a shelf full of glass jars and laboratory equipment. The shelves fall on Alices head, knocking her out momentarily, and the vials break up noisily on the ground.The police vehicles stop by Dr. Meirschultz's place, and two detectives and two uniformed cops go in without knocking on the door. Mrs. Buckley grabs the stunned Mrs. Maxwell by the scruff of her neck with her left hand, and proceeds to strangle her with her right. Alice is almost finished, as her foe stands, picks up a flower pot, and bashes her head with it. Alice still has strength to scream out loud enough to be heard upstairs by the police.
On hearing the woman's scream, Inspector Jones gets inquisitive.
Maxwell candidly enough, assumes its two of his patients who are battling it out in the basement.
What kind of place is this, anyway? asks the detective.
Maxwell, trying to explain it in a few words, argues that These women have the gleam!
The detective finds the way to the basement and goes down, followed by the two cops forcing the mad man between them.
When the police arrive, the two women are on their knees, still fighting. A police in uniform grabs Buckleys arms, and pulls her off Alice and towards the staircase. The plainclothes detective helps Mrs. Maxwell up and holds her in the opposite corner.
(48:15) The policemen ear another scream from behind the brick wall, and since the fake doctor is not offering any sensible explanation, they bring the wall down. The doctor is there all right, and moving; but thats because of Satan the cat that is standing on his right shoulder. Satan jumps away, and the corpse falls forward, breaking the rest of the brick wall. The film ends with a last scientific text(48:55) COMPLEX: Manias are created by inability to adjust to the world as it is. Insanity is our defence against a world which is not of our making or to our liking. The normal person can make such an adjustment. It is not always easy, but it is being done constantly. The person of inferior mental capacity can not do this. He therefore creates a world in his mind which is his own idea of the world of his choice. He retreats to this world whenever the other world becomes unbearable. This explains the periods of rationalism all mental cases have. The periods of rationalism depends upon the unbearableness of the real world. There are many people of sound mind who find one particular thing unbearable. When this is the case, he is said to be a victim of such a complex.Maxwell is more calm now, behind bars - and he starts a speech on insanity recalling the gleam! He claims he did not want to be a criminal, he only wanted ...to amuse, to entertain. Dr. Meirschult'z is my brilliant impersonation! (50:55m)

title: The Invisible Man
synopsis: The 1933 version of the work of H.G. Wells opens with title and credits. A man trudges through the snow to the small village of Iping. His destination is the Lion's Head Pub and Inn. The place is a buzz of activity: drinking and laughing, and a game of darts. The stranger, Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) walks in covered from head to toe, head bandaged, and wearing a false nose. All sound in the Pub ceases. The stranger approaches the proprietor, Herbert Hall (Forrester Harvey) and requests, I want a room and a fire. Hall calls to his wife, Jenny (Una OConnor). Jenny explains they have no rooms ready, as summer is their normal season, but one can be prepared. Jenny calls to Minnie (Merle Tottenham). Jenny leads Dr. Griffin to his room, sending Minnie on ahead. Minnie lights a lamp while Jenny builds a fire and explains, It's the coldest winter we've had down here for years. Griffin asks about his luggage, but Jenny explains she'll arrange for it in the morning. His final request before Jenny departs is for some food. Griffin closes the drapes in his room.The townsfolk are suspicious of the stranger. One man speculates, If you ask me, he's a criminal flying from justice. He advises Herbert to lockup his money. Jenny carries a tray up to his room and walks in without knocking. Griffin asks about a key and is told there is none. He emphatically states, I want to be left alone and undisturbed. Jenny leaves and Griffin removes his coat. Jenny returns to the kitchen only to be told by Minnie that she forgot the mustard. Jenny makes a second trip to Griffin's room. Again she does not knock, just bursts in. Griffin is seated, and the lower half of his face is gone. Jenny is shocked by what she sees as Griffin masks his face with a napkin. Griffin angrily reminds the landlady, I told you not to disturb me. Jenny cautiously approaches, mustard in hand, and asks Griffin if he's had a motor car accident. Griffin tells Jenny to take the overcoat to dry, but leave the hat. Jenny leaves Griffin's room. She runs downstairs to report to all who'll listen, Bandages right up to the top of his head, all around his ears.At a large country home, Dr. Cranley (Henry Travers) works in a large room converted into a laboratory. His daughter, Flora Cranley (Gloria Stuart) enters the lab wishing to speak. Dr. Cranley admonishes her, I wish you'd leave me alone, Flora, when I'm working. Flora is concerned nothing is being done about Jack. He has been away for a month now and no word from him. Dr. Arthur Kemp (William Harrigan) enters the room and is told Flora is worried about Dr. Jack Griffin. Flora storms off sobbing, and Arthur tries to comfort her. Dr. Kemp tells Flora, He meddled in things men should leave alone. The group was working on food preservation advances, but Jack preferred to work in secret. Flora is interested in Jack romantically, as is Dr. Kemp.A week later, Griffin is in his room. He has set the place up as a mini-laboratory and mutters to himself, There's a way back, you fool. There must be a way back. Jenny arrives with Griffin's lunch, but he still doesn't want to be disturbed. He slams the door closed and she drops the tray. Jenny tells her husband she wants him out, his room is a mess and he is behind on his rent. She sends her husband to do the dirty work. The disturbance annoys Griffin, And a whole days work ruined...by a foolish, ignorant woman! Hall barges his way into Griffin's room with bill in hand. Griffin explains his money will be forthcoming. He explains he is working and pleads for a little more time, undisturbed. Griffin admits he had an accident that disfigured him and it affected his eyes. Hall won't budge, so Griffin turns hostile. He tosses Hall out of his room and down the stairs. Bruised and bleeding, Hall comes to in the arms of his hysterical, shrieking wife. The police are summoned.Constable Jaffers (E.E. Clive) is surrounded by the townsfolk. He asks what's all this and is told the stranger with the goggles has gone mad, assaulted Mrs. Hall and nearly killed Mr. Hall. Jaffers pulls out his baton and walks upstairs, followed closely by half a dozen men. Jaffers confronts Griffin. He intends to arrest Griffin, but Griffin threatens, All right you fools. You've brought it on yourselves...now you'll suffer for it! You're crazy to know who I am, aren't you? All right, I'll show you. Griffin proceeds to remove his false nose, and then his goggles. The head under the bandages is hollow. Next he removes the bandages, laughing maniacally. Jaffers observes, Look. He's all eaten away. They all run from Griffin's room. Jaffers and a few men return to his room, but all that is visible is a shirt bobbing in the air. Griffin explains that all that was needed is a few chemicals mixed together, Flesh and blood and bone just fade away. Jaffers closes the door, but Griffin takes the window to exit the room. Jaffers runs to the window, but to his surprise, Griffin taunts him, Think I'd escape like a common criminal? You need a lesson. I think Ill throttle you. Griffin beats up the men guarding the door, then escapes downstairs knocking the grandfather clock over in the process. He steals a bicycle and rides off, and then menaces the townsfolk with pranks.Doctors Cranley and Kemp go through the fireplace ash looking for clues to Griffin's work or location. They did find a list of drugs and chemicals. The last on the list is monocaine. Cranley explains that monocaine is a terrible drug: made from a flower grown in India. It draws color from everything it touches. It was tried as a bleach for cloth, but destroyed the material. In a German experiment it was used on a dog: it bleached it white and drove it mad.Griffin enters the home of Dr. Kemp. He opens the French door and a gust of wind is blamed for a paper flying off his desk. A radio broadcast reports a mass delusion among the people of Iping; they believe an invisible man is living among them. Kemp makes the connection just as Griffin shuts off the radio and announces his presence, And everyone deserves the fate that's coming to them: panic, death, things worse than death. Don't be afraid Kemp. It's me, Griffin. A rocking chair moves across the room and the seat collapses downward. Kemp is shocked. Griffin threatens Kemp. He tells him to sit down and listen to his story. After insulting Kemp, Griffin demands a surgical bandage, a pair of dark glasses, a dressing gown, pajamas, and a pair of gloves. Griffin go to a bedroom to put his pajamas on. He continuously threatens Dr. Kemp.Chief Detective (Dudley Digges) arrives at the Lion's Head. He is annoyed and doesn't believe the stories after a ten mile search of the area. He thinks it is a hoax being used to generate publicity and business for the Pub. The inspector starts an inquiry. Back at Kemp's home, Griffin exits the bedroom covered from head to toe. Griffin and Kemp sit and talk in the study. He tells Kemp it started five years earlier, working in secret: a thousand experiments and a thousand failures. He admits he was working on an antidote. Then Griffin admitted, It came to me suddenly. The drugs I took seemed to light up my brain. Suddenly I realized the power I held. The power to rule, to make the world grovel at my feet. Well soon put the world right now, Kemp. You and I. Griffin needs a visible partner. He adds, We'll begin with a reign of terror, a few murders here and there...We might even wreck a train or two. Kemp admonishes his colleague, but is cowed by the threats. Kemp gets his car, as instructed, and they drive back to Iping to get Griffin's notes.The detective questions the townsfolk, including the bicycle owner (an uncredited Walter Brennan). Kemp and Griffin stop a short distance from the Pub. They walk to the Pub. Griffin enters the Pub and walks upstairs to his room. He gathers his books and notes and passes them through the window. As the detective goes to sign some papers the ink well moves around on the table by itself. The ink is thrown on the man's face. Mugs and pitchers fly off the walls and counters at the assembled police and witnesses. They all run from the Pub. Griffin chokes the Chief Detective and hits him with a stool. Griffin runs back to the waiting car. Dr. Cranley goes to see Inspector Lane. A crowd gathers around a newspaper boy distributing the latest news on the Invisible Man. The newspaper headline blares, Invisible Man Slays Policeman.Griffin reveals to Kemp he must remain in hiding after meals. The food is visible inside me until it is digested. I can only work on fine, clear days. If I work in the rain, the water can be seen on my head and shoulders. In a fog, you can see me, like a bubble. In smoky cities, the soot settles on me until you can see a dark outline. Griffin goes to bed after taking off his head bandages and dark glasses.The Chief of Police (Holmes Herbert) gives orders to his men on the plan to search the countryside for twenty miles in all directions. A contingent of a thousand men, and thousands more volunteers will comb the countryside. At 10:30 p.m. a radio broadcast explains that the story is not a hoax and volunteers are needed. A reward of 1000 pounds is offered. Kemp checks on Griffin to make sure he is asleep. He calls Dr. Cranley to tell him Griffin is mad and is the Invisible Man. Cranley tells his colleague he will come in the morning, but for the time being, keep Griffin calm and quiet. Flora demands to know the truth and her father tells her. A man (an uncredited John Carradine) suggest throwing ink on the Invisible Man to make him visible. Dr. Kemp calls the police and reports that the Invisible Man is asleep in his home. Flora wants to help, but her father explains it is dangerous, as Griffin is mad and dangerous. Dr. Cranley and Flora drive over to Kemp's house. Kemp admits he told Cranley when Griffin accuses him of betrayal. Despite warning, Flora goes to see Griffin in his room. Griffin tells Flora he did it all for her, to gain wealth and fame and honor. He intends to sell the secret of invisibility to the highest bidder to allow invisible armies to sweep the world. Griffin rants and raves. Flora explains that monocaine has a terrible side effect. The police surround the Kemp home. Griffin escorts Flora out of his room so he can deal with the police. The police link arms and move towards the house. Griffin confronts Kemp in his office. He promises his friend to kill him the next day at 10:00 p.m. Griffin taunts the police and escapes.The Chief of Police questions Cranley and Kemp, but gets little information. Griffin attacks a search party. He derails a train, sending it crashing into a river killing one hundred people. At Lloyd's Bank he steals a cashiers drawer and hands out cash to eager people on the street. A reporter (an uncredited Dwight Frye) asks the Chief, Can you tell us what plans you've got for capturing him? At the Cranley home, Flora paces her room. After sweeping an empty room with a net, the Chief divulges his plan. It involves the death threat on Dr. Kemp. Kemp objects to being used as bait. The plan also includes dressing Kemp up like policeman. Kemp decides to see to his own safety. He drives his own car away, but Griffin is in the back seat. Griffin gloats, telling Kemp the story of watching the elaborate plan for his safety. Griffin ties up Kemp, places him back in the car and pushes the vehicle over a cliff. The car explodes into flames.Griffin sleeps in a barn overnight. The farmer sees the hay move and walks over to investigate. It begins to snow. The farmer walks into the police station to report the Invisible Man is in his barn. The plan now is to burn down the barn and follow the footprints in the snow should he escape. The Chief fires on the Invisible Man, using his footprints in the snow to take aim at his target.At hospital, a doctor reports to the Chief that, He's very near the end. The doctor explains to Dr. Cranley that the bullet passed through both lungs. The wounds are impossible to treat. As he dies his body will become visible. Flora goes into his room to be with Griffin. We close with a close-up view of a hospital bed and pillow. At first a skull appears resting on the pillow, then his eyes, and finally the face of Dr. Jack Griffin.

title: The Dark Knight
synopsis: The movie begins with a gang of men with clown masks breaking into the bank where the mob has a large portion of their money stashed. It begins with five clowns, each getting a cut of the spoils. They suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'The Joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. As the robbery goes on, the clowns begin to kill each other in order to get a larger cut, until a school bus crashes through the wall of the bank, killing another clown. A mob bank manager, who was himself shot with an automatic weapon after he tried to take out the clowns with a shotgun, tells the remaining clown that he doesn't know who he is dealing with. The clown kneels down and tells the banker, Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...stranger... then removes his mask to reveal that he himself is The Joker. Joker puts a grenade into the banker's mouth and boards the bus, leaving a string attached to the pin. The bus pulls out with all of the bank's cash and the pin pops out. It is just a gas grenade. The Joker joins a long line of school buses leaving the scene as the police arrive.Gotham is then seen at night with criminals afraid to commit crimes under the watchful sign of the batsignal projected onto the clouds. We see Lt. James Gordon manning the batsignal, waiting for Batman with Det. Anna Ramirez, who asks if he's coming. Gordon explains that it is okay if he is not, hoping that he is busy elsewhere.Meanwhile, in a parking garage, the Scarecrow is negotiating with the Russian mob members over the sale of some of his fear-inducing drugs. The sale is interrupted when some of Gotham's citizens dressed as Batmen wanna-be's begin shooting at the men. As he gases one of the fake Batmen with his mind-altering drugs from his cuff, the Scarecrow notes that they are not the real Batman, because Batman would never use a gun. Suddenly the Batmobile/Tumbler crashes through a barricade and Scarecrow notes, That's more like it! The Batmobile fires rockets into a nearby office, causing the remaining mobsters to begin to flee. The real Batman arrives on the scene and bends the rifle of one of the wanna-be Batmen before knocking him out.The Chechen sends his rottweilers to attack the Batmen, and as Batman saves them he takes the dogs out after being badly bitten in the arm. The Scarecrow attempts to flee in a white van but Batman jumps onto the van and begins cutting into the side with his device called the mangler. Scarecrow swerves into a support which sends Batman to the ground. As Scarecrow gets away down a spiraling passageway, Batman leaps onto the roof of his van, smashing it to a halt. He leaves the fake Batmen and the Scarecrow along with some of the mobsters tied up together for the police to eventually round up.Gordon arrives at the bank the Joker held up earlier with Ramirez who shows him the Joker's picture from a security camera. Batman arrives to inspect the scene, noting that they have irradiated the drug money to make it easier to trace. When Gordon asks him if the Joker is a threat, Batman informs him that he cannot worry about one man when there is an entire mob to bring down.The next day, as Bruce Wayne stitches himself up from the dog bite, Alfred offers his concerns, warning Bruce to 'know his limits'. He notices Bruce keeping a close watch on newly appointed district attorney Harvey Dent via some computer screens, as Bruce is trying to decide whether or not Dent can be trusted. Alfred wonders if he is really spying on the relationship that Rachel Dawes has developed with Harvey Dent.Harvey Dent arrives in court to join Rachel Dawes in prosecuting mobster Salvatore Maroni, the alleged new leader of the Falcone crime family. One of Maroni's men takes the fall in court, and attempts to shoot Dent from the witness stand. The gun doesn't go off and Dent punches the man before he is hauled off to jail. Maroni is eventually set free, to the dismay of Dent.Dent meets Lt. Gordon, and after a short exchange of words, they both express their distrust for those that are working in each other's offices. Harvey interrogates Gordon over his involvement with the Batman and Harvey tells him he wants to meet him. Gordon requests search warrants for five banks that are believed to be holding the remainder of the mobs money. Dent agrees to back Gordon's search warrants, forming a tenuous trust with the honest Gordon, who in turn hails Dent as Gotham's White Knight while Dent questions Gordon about another nickname they had for him when he was at I.A.D., a nickname Gordon claims to have no knowledge of.Lucius Fox holds a board meeting at Wayne Enterprises, negotiating an joint venture with Lau, the head of Lau Security Investments, based in Hong Kong. After the meeting with Lau, Wayne expresses his reservations with Lucius Fox about Lau's business operation, apparently illegal based on their profits. After agreeing to cancel the deal, Wayne asks Fox for a new suit. He explains that he needs to be lighter, and faster, in case he runs into any more guard dogs.That night, Harvey dines out with Rachel. Harvey tells Rachel he had to make a reservation weeks earlier, and even then needed to exercised his influence to get a table at the very fashionable restaurant. Bruce and his date, the prima ballerina for the Russian ballet, encounter Rachel and Harvey. Bruce has them pull a table together so they can dine together, informing Harvey that he owns the restaurant. At first, Bruce seems jealous and threatened by Harvey, based on the fact that he is dating his own love interest, but Harvey explains how he supports the work of Batman and appreciates his help. Bruce changes his tune and informs Harvey that he intends to throw a massive fund-raiser for him.Meanwhile, all of the top mob members are having a meeting. Because of their inside sources in the police, they were aware that the banks that their money was stashed in were going to be searched. Lau appears to them on a television monitor from his plane on his way back to Hong Kong. He informs the mob that all of their money has already been moved to a single secure location, just as Lt. Gordon and company are searching the banks, finding nothing but the irradiated trace money. When the Chechen expresses concern over the man with the clown makeup stealing $68 million from one of their banks, Maroni dismisses him as nothing but a nobody.The Joker enters in the room, and after killing a hostile mob member's crony by way of a 'magic trick', sits down and talks with the mob about how pathetic they've become since Batman came around. He tells them their one solution is to 'Kill the Batman', and offers to do so for half the mob's money. He warns them about Lau, saying he knows a squealer when he sees one, causing Lau to promptly turn off his monitor. The mob laughs, and as one of the mobsters, Gambol, rises from his seat and threatens the Joker, the Joker opens his coat, exposing grenades. Gambol tells the Joker that he's putting a price out on his head. The Joker tells the mob that when they plan to take things a little more seriously, give him a call, and presents them with 'his card', a joker playing card. And with that, he exits. But not before warning that Batman will come for Lau.Harvey Dent, with Gordon, lights the batsignal to meet with Batman, who appears. As Dent and Gordon blame one another for the money's disappearance due to leaks from corrupt officers in the other's departments, they explain to Batman that they need Lau back, realizing that Batman is under no one's jurisdiction. They want to make him talk, and give up all the mob members' names. Batman agrees and disappears.Fox shows Wayne his new suit, and Wayne begins planning an impromptu trip to Hong Kong. Fox will accompany him, making it look like the only reason for his visit was to cancel the negotiations with Lau's company.Gambol is playing pool with some of his associates until one of them informs him that a group of hoodlums havd killed the Joker, and has the body. The body is brought in covered in a bag, and as Gambol is about to pay, the Joker rises up and holds a knife to his face while his men hold guns to his associates' heads. The Joker tells a story about how he got his scars from his father, and then kills Gambol. He offers the three surviving associates an opportunity to join his team, but he has only one opening. He leave the three with the halves of a broken, sharp pool stick and no choice but to fight each other for their lives.Meanwhile, Fox arrives in Hong Kong to meet with Lau. He checks in his mobile phone at the front desk at Lau's building, as there are no cell phones allowed on the premises. Fox meets with Lau, and informs him of Wayne Enterprises' plans to cancel negotiations with his company. However, he secretly keeps one cell phone in his pocket, which has been adapted to produce a sonar map of the surrounding area. Upon leaving the building, he does not pick up the phone he dropped off, and he produces the map of the building to Bruce Wayne. That night, the phone that Fox left at the front desk emits a high frequency that shuts down all power in the building. Batman crashes in through a window in Lau's office, and after disabling some guards, grabs Lau and escapes by sending a balloon attached to a cable to a plane he has chartered flying over Lau's building.Back in Gotham, Lau is interrogated by Rachel with Dent and Gordon looking on. Rachel presses him to give them the money Lau has taken, but Lau will not give in. After she threatens to have him moved to the County lock-up, Lau tells her that he can give them the names of the mobsters and their pooled investments. Dent then realizes that they will have the leverage they need in a RICO case of conspiracy to link all of the mob members together. Gordon decides to keep Lau in his holding cell at the Major Case Unit building and Lau agrees to cooperate with the police, and give the names of the mob members.Gordon appears at Maroni's restaurant as the police rush in to arrest all of the mob members in attendance. As all of the mob members that Lau informed the police are rounded up for arraignment, Judge Janet Surrillo finds a Joker card in the middle of the stack of conviction papers. Dent gives a televised impromptu interview denying Batman's involvement while expressing gratitude for the police work in bringing the mob members to justice.Dent, Gordon, and Commissioner Loeb meet with the mayor to tell him that Dent's rash indictment of the mob members will give the mayor clean streets for 18 months. The mayor informs Dent that his brash actions will bring down the full might of Gotham's underworld and corrupt citizens solely upon him. When the mayor asks if Dent is ready to be the city's target the dead body of a Batman wanna-be hanging by a noose slams against the mayor's window dressed up in a Batman suit, with makeup on his face like the Joker's - complete with the sides of the mouth sliced into a grin - and with a Joker card pinned to him reading 'Will the real Batman please stand up?'. Bruce and Alfred watch on as a video tape is played on the news of the Joker tormenting the wanna-be before killing him. He then promises that until Batman takes off his mask and shows everyone who he really is, people will die every day.As Harvey Dent's fund-raiser at Wayne's penthouse gets underway, Rachel and a nervous Dent arrive and mingle. Wayne arrives with three models via helicopter and seeks out Harvey, whom he applauds and throws his full support behind claiming, I believe in Harvey Dent. Minutes later, Rachel meets with Bruce on the balcony upset that Bruce is making fun at Dent but Bruce tells her that he truly believes in Harvey and that he could be the White Knight that will allow him to hang up his mantle as Batman so they can be together. Dent joins them to thank Bruce and retrieve Rachel.Meanwhile Gordon discovers that there are 3 traces of DNA on the Joker card, from Commissioner Loeb, Harvey Dent, and Judge Surrillo, the Judge that is trying all of the mob members and found the card among the paperwork. Gordon takes this as a threat on their lives, and begins preparations to protect them. In the case of the Judge and Commissioner Loeb, however, this fails. The Judge's car blows up when the police arrive to take her into protective custody and Commissioner Loeb dies of severe poisoning from his liquor bottle before Gordon can stop him from drinking.Dent takes Rachel aside to ask her to marry him, but she is torn and cannot give him an answer. Bruce subdues Dent and locks him in a closet while Rachel watches in shock. Bruce tells Rachel that they (the Joker and his goons) have come for Harvey and to stay hidden from sight.The Joker and his goons burst in telling the guests that they are tonight's 'entertainment. The Joker scans the room seeking out Harvey Dent when Rachel steps forward. He grabs her and pulls a knife on her telling her a different version of the story about how he got his scars, claiming that his wife was scarred by loan sharks and that he took a razor to himself to make her smile, but that she left him over it. Rachel kicks him away and he comes after her saying that he likes that little fight in her, when Batman shows up and sends him reeling. A fight breaks out between Batman, the Joker, and his goons with the Joker and the goons beating on Batman pretty well. When Batman gains the upper hand he sees the Joker holding a gun at Rachel's head as he dangles her out of a shot out window. Batman demands he let her go, to which the Joker replies Very poor choice of words and lets her fall. Batman dives out the window and saves her using his cape to slow their fall as they crash into the roof of a car on the street. The Joker apparently vanishes from the scene.The next day, Wayne tries to figure out what the Joker is after. Alfred relates a story of when he was in Burma with friends attempting to nullify the local criminals by bribing them with jewels. One thief however, tossed these bribes away and continued to raid the local convoys. When Bruce seems confused over this behavior Alfred informs him that some men can't be reasoned with, they don't want anything in particular, that they kill for sport. Alfred observes that they just want to watch the world burn, as Bruce fixates on the Joker's face on a monitor.Batman is seen on the edge of a rooftop listening in to cell phone frequencies when he overhears a plot against Harvey Dent. Gordon rushes to the apartment with Ramirez and Batman to find two policemen murdered, with the last names Harvey and Dent. Ramirez begins to blame Batman, but Gordon cuts her off. As Batman removes a piece of concrete wall that contains a bullet used in the murders in hopes of finding evidence, Gordon notes that the Joker has left an advance copy of tomorrow's newspaper indicating the death of the mayor.At Wayne Enterprises, Fox meets with Wayne's accountant Coleman Reese, who claims to know about certain problems with Wayne's funding in research and development, claiming that Wayne has some sort of government project with cell phones for the army underway. He also uncovers Fox's designs for the Batmobile/Tumbler. He tells Fox that he wants $10 million per year for the rest of his life to keep this a secret. Fox smiles and says, Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world is a secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands, and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.Fox helps Wayne reconstruct the bullet taken from the murder scene and produces a fingerprint. Fox asks him if he has reassigned the R&D department. Bruce acknowledges that he has, claiming he is playing this one close to the chest.Wayne traces the bullet fingerprint's owner to an apartment overlooking the funeral speeches for Commissioner Loeb and takes off on motorcycle.As the ceremony continues on the street below, Wayne inspects a room where he believes the Joker might be, and he finds several men tied up. They tell Wayne that their guns and uniforms were stolen. Wayne inspects binoculars pointed out of a blinded window. The window blind is connected to a timer. As the timer reaches zero, the blinds quickly raise, and the police snipers positioned around the area all shoot in that direction. At the same time, the Joker, who had removed his makeup and played himself off as a member of the honor guard for the ceremony, turns and takes a shot at the mayor, but Lt. Gordon dives in the way, getting shot in the back and falling. Everyone panics and runs, but the police shoot one member of the honor guard in the leg and haul him into a truck. Dent himself climbs in the truck, and upon inspecting the criminal, sees that the name-tag on his uniform reads 'Officer Rachel Dawes'. He calls Rachel and informs her that she's been targeted, and to get to the safest place she can, which in her case is Bruce's penthouse. He tells her he loves her, but there is no answer from Rachel.Gordon's family is visited at home, to inform them of the death of Gordon at the funeral ceremony. Gordon's wife, Barbara, shouts out at the empty sky to Batman that he has brought this craziness upon Gotham. Gordon's young son catches a brief glimpse of Batman mournfully watching the scene.Meanwhile, Batman enters a club and grabs Maroni after beating on his men. He interrogates Maroni on the Joker's whereabouts, who claims that he should have held him from a higher location. Batman drops him off the ledge, injuring his legs and learns that Maroni has no idea where the Joker is. Maroni explains that the Joker has no friends and no one will give him up because unlike Batman, he plays by no rules.As Dent is interrogating the captured so-called honor guard member about what he knows about the Joker, he is enraged and holds a gun to his head. He flips his father's lucky silver dollar for his life, coming up on heads. As he flips the coin again, Batman shows up and snatches the coin in midair, asking if Dent would really leave a thug's life up to chance, to which Dent answers, Not exactly. He informs Harvey that this criminal - Thomas Schiff - is a paranoid schizophrenic patient from Arkham Asylum and that he won't learn anything from him. He also tells Harvey that if anyone saw this unjust way of interrogating someone, all that good work that Dent's done for Gotham would be lost. He tells Harvey to hold a press conference the following day, because he wants to use that opportunity to turn himself in. As Batman leaves, Harvey yells at him that he can't give in.Bruce arrives back in his penthouse to find Rachel waiting. She tells him that turning himself in will not stop the Joker's murderous rampage, but Bruce says he has enough blood on his hands already. He reminds her that she promised him that they would be together if and when he hung up the mantle of Batman. She tells Bruce not to make her his only hope for a normal life and they share a kiss. She tells Bruce that if he turns himself in as Batman that the city will never let them be together.Back at Wayne's secret base of operations for Batman, he and Alfred begin destroying everything that might tie Lucius Fox or Rachel to Batman. Alfred tries to talk Bruce out of it, asking him to endure these trying times and allow Batman to make the right choice that nobody else can for the good of the city. Bruce explains that Batman cannot endure the responsibility for innocents dying, especially where Rachel is concerned.At the press conference, Harvey attempts to reason with the assembled press and police to not give in to the fear that the Joker has unleashed upon the city. He agrees that Batman is a vigilante but that the people of Gotham should hold him accountable, and not give in to the whims of this terrorist known as the Joker. However, the people are overcome with fear, crying out No more dead cops, to applause indicating that Harvey will not be able to sway them. Upon his failure, Harvey announces that HE is the Batman, and gets handcuffed and taken away. Bruce Wayne is shown with a look of confusion on his face.Rachel, watching the news conference at Bruce Wayne's penthouse, confronts Alfred over Bruce's seeming cowardice in allowing Harvey to take the fall when he claims to be Batman. Alfred explains to Rachel that Batman is instead allowing himself to be something else besides a hero, mainly a figure outside of the system that the people can both turn to or blame in times of need, that Batman can 'take it. Rachel gives Alfred a letter for Bruce and tells him to give it to Bruce when the time is right. When Alfred asks what it is, she tells him it is open and hugs him before departing to see Harvey as he is being transported to the County lock-up.While being taken to a convoy that will transport him to a county, Harvey explains to Rachel that this is Batman's chance. He then pulls out the coin and says Heads: I go through with this, and flips it, landing on heads. When Rachel tells him that he can't leave something like that to chance, he tosses her the coin, revealing that it is a two-headed coin. During this transport, he's planning on getting attacked by the Joker, and he's planning on Batman to come and save him, and to capture the Joker. The convoy takes off.While transporting Harvey, the Joker and some goons start taking out the police cars in a large semi truck. He pulls out an RPG and beings firing at the armored truck carrying Dent. The Tumbler arrives and attempts to stop the Joker, and gets hit with the RPG in the process. His car takes 'catastrophic' damage, and he's forced to eject. However, the ejection in this car is a bike, that deploys out the front of the car. This bike becomes known as the 'Batpod'. Batman chases down the Joker on his Batpod, and after firing some cables at the truck and weaving them through some light poles and buildings, flips the truck completely over. The Joker emerges with a Smith & Wesson M76 Submachine gun and shoots at Batman, who speeds towards him on his Batpod, all the while screaming at Batman to hit him. Batman honors his own non-lethal code and swerves around the Joker then crashes into the flipped truck, falling to the ground. As the Joker jumps on him with a knife, one of the SWAT officers holds a gun to the back of his head, and upon removing his helmet and mask, shows that it was Lt. Gordon, who faked his death to protect his family. The Joker is hauled away to the MCU. Harvey gets out of the truck and into a cruiser, stating he is off to see a worried girlfriend.At Gordon's Major Crimes Unit building, Gordon is promoted to Commissioner by the Mayor. The Joker shares a cell with a large man who complains about his insides hurting. Commissioner Gordon, after reuniting with his family, gets a call explaining that Harvey never made it home. He returns to the prison to interrogate the Joker. During the interrogation, Batman appears and starts beating on the Joker, trying to find out where Harvey is. The Joker gets under Batman's skin telling him that they are both freaks and that when the people of Gotham no longer view Batman as a necessity, they will turn on him. Batman becomes enraged and puts a chair under the door and beats the Joker savagely, but The Joker just laughs and defiantly tells Batman that there is nothing he can do to him to hurt him and that he actually enjoys the beatings. The Joker sadistically reveals that not just Harvey, but Rachel are in separate locations, both tied up and strapped to explosives that will explode in a short amount of time. He gives the locations of the two, saying that he only has time to save one of them and that he must make a choice that will violate Batman's code of non-lethal means...that one of them will die since Batman cannot save them both. Batman heads off, telling Gordon that he's going after Rachel. Gordon gets some men ready and heads off after Harvey.As Batman and the police are rushing towards the two prisoners, Harvey awakens to hear Rachel's voice. Whoever captured them set up an intercom system so that the two can communicate. Harvey tells Rachel that everything will be OK, and Rachel tells Harvey that she wants to marry him. While Dent's trying to hop around in his chair trying to find something sharp to cut his ropes with, he falls over and knocks an oil drum down, and the gasoline spills all over half of his face. Meanwhile, back at the jail, the Joker tricks a cop and holds him hostage, and he tells the other cops he just wants his phone call. Upon getting a cell phone and dialing a number, the large man that was in the cell with him blows up. The Joker had cut him open and implanted a cell phone-triggered device inside of him. The Joker grabs Lau and flees the jail.Batman arrives at the address that the Joker had told him Rachel was at, but when he opens the door, he finds Harvey Dent instead, who screams in despair at having been found instead of Rachel. Gordon arrives at the supposed location for Dent but the warehouse explodes and Rachel is killed. As Batman saves Dent by carrying him out of the warehouse, the explosion ignites the gas that saturated Dent's face, horribly burning it. Dent is taken to Gotham General Hospital. Batman visits Dent in the hospital, and leaves him the two-headed coin that they found at Rachel's site of death. One side of the coin is still shiny, while the other side is scraped and burnt.Alfred reads Rachel's letter. She explains that she is going to marry Harvey Dent and that when she told him that she would be with him when he no longer need to be Batman that she meant it. However, she realizes that he will always be Batman so she will always be there as his friend.Bruce expresses to Alfred his devastation behind losing Rachel and that he feels responsible for inspiring madness and death. he tells Alfred that she was going to wait for him. Alfred chooses not to give him her letter, saying the time is not right and that with Harvey Dent hospitalized, it will be up to him alone to fight the crime in Gotham City. Meanwhile, Harvey wakes up in the hospital with a large bandage over half of his face, finds his now scarred two-headed coin, and screams out in anguish over losing the one person he loved.Commissioner Gordon visits Dent and tries to tell him how sorry he is for what has transpired, questioning why Dent refused skin grafts and how he can stand to be in unrelenting agony over his disfigurement. Harvey is filled with rage for Gordon not listening to him when he warned Gordon not to trust the corrupt officers that Dent investigated during his time in Internal Affairs which has resulted in Dent's disfigurement and ultimately Rachel's death. Dent demands Gordon tell him the nickname they had for him when he was in I.A., which Gordon ashamedly replies Harvey Two-Face, while being forced to stare at the extensive burns and scarred tissue that have enveloped half of Harvey's face. As Gordon leaves an emotionally devastated Harvey, he runs into Maroni in the hallway who tells him that the Joker has gone too far and that if Gordon wants the clown, he knows where he will be.Wayne's accountant Reese appears on a news show claiming to be able to tell the world who Batman is. He tells Gotham that he is going to reveal Batman's identity, but before he can, the Joker calls in to the show saying that he doesn't want this lawyer to ruin his fun. He says that if the lawyer is not killed within 60 minutes, he is going to blow up a hospital. This triggers the police to rush in and protect the lawyer, and try to carry him to safety. At the same time, other police are evacuating all of the hospitals in Gotham City. When they get to Gotham General, a police officer attempts to evacuate a nurse in Harvey Dent's room, which then turns out to be the Joker, and he kills the cop. He then explains to Two-Face how he needs to introduce a little anarchy and chaos, how easy it is to bring down all the good people in the world and how it's all fair. Joker unties Two-Face and hands him a pistol. Two-Face, bent on revenge and now believing everything in the world should be decided by chance, flips the double-headed coin to decide whether or not to shoot Joker which Joker agrees is only fair. Though we don't see it, the coin obviously lands on the clean side since the next scene shows Joker leaving Gotham General Hospital as it blows up in the background.Afterwards, the Joker appears on TV again, forcing kidnapped GCN reporter Mike Engle to read out his plans. He reads that Gotham City now belongs to the Joker, starting that very evening. Anyone that doesn't want to be a part of his game should leave now, but they are going to have a hard time leaving the city by the bridges. He alludes to the fact that something big was going to happen that very night. During which, Two-Face enters a local bar where Detective Wuertz - the 'dirty' cop that had picked him up after the Joker was captured - hangs out. After questioning him, he flips the coin which lands on the dirty side and he kills Wuertz. At the same time, Batman uses Fox's 'cell phone sonar' technology to somehow turn every single cell phone in Gotham into a sonar device, giving him the opportunity to spy on everyone in Gotham. He calls Fox in, and tells him to monitor the screens, and give him updates on the Joker's location when he sees him. Fox is appalled that Batman would use his technology to spy on the citizens of Gotham and reluctantly agrees to help, stating that the machine must be destroyed after the Joker is captured or he will have to retire.Two-Face continues to question mob members, trying to uncover the identity of the dirty cop that kidnapped Rachel. When confronting Maroni in Maroni's car, he learns that the other cop is Ramirez. He then flips the coin for Maroni, which lands on the clean side. Lucky Man, he remarks before he flips it again. It lands on the dirty side and he buckles up and states, But he's not as he shoots Maroni's driver, causing the car to veer off the road and crash into the dockyards. Meanwhile, two large ferries leave Gotham due to the Joker's threats. One is inhabited by criminals that Harvey and Gordon helped put away, the other is packed with innocent citizens - the city's bridges apparently being wired with explosives. While sailing off, the two boats completely lose all power and their engines die. Both ships eventually realize that there are explosives strewn all about the boat, and they both find detonators. It is at this time that the Joker's voice is heard over the loudspeaker of both ferries, and he informs them that they are part of a social experiment. The detonator on each boat is for the other boat. One ferry must press the button and destroy the other boat by midnight, or else the Joker will destroy both boats. This brings about much chaos in both boats, and a lot of soul searching about morality and about if anyone could actually do such a thing.Fox finds the Joker, who is holed up in a building still being constructed with many clown guards. Batman notifies Gordon of the location, and speeds off towards the building. Meanwhile, Two-Face forces a frightened Ramirez to call Gordon's family and tell his wife and children to meet her at the exact spot where Rachel was killed. They believe her because they trust her. Afterwards, Two-Face, angered with Ramirez's pleas to spare her life for the sake of her sick mother, flips for Ramirez's life. The coin lands on heads, so he just knocks her out, telling her that she lives to fight another day. As Gordon arrives at the building where the Joker is, he gets a call from his family telling him they are being held captive by Two-Face in the place where Rachel was killed. Gordon rushes off to save his family as Batman breaks in to the building. After realizing that the clown guards are the actual hostages and the doctors/hostages are the Joker's goons, he beats down some SWAT members in order to prevent them from killing the clown guards, and he disables the goons as he makes his way up to the Joker's location. When he finally confronts the Joker, the Joker sends the Chechen's rottweilers after him, and while Batman fights them off, the Joker beats him brutally with a blunt metal object, and eventually throws him close to the edge of the building, trapping him under a metal beam.At the same time, the two boats are still debating what to do with the detonators. On the 'criminal ferry', one of the largest and meanest-looking convicts makes a speech about the warden holding the trigger not knowing how to take life, then goes up to the warden and asks to take the trigger so he himself can do what the warden should have done ten minutes ago. The warden hands the convict the trigger and the convict promptly throws it out of the ferry, making it impossible for anyone on the convict ferry to blow up the 'innocent' ferry. On the innocent ferry, after having voted to use their detonator, the officials can't bring themselves to act out the decision. A man stands up, takes the detonator but is unable to press the button.The Joker, on top of Batman while holding him down, shows signs of disappointment when neither of the ferries' passengers will stoop to his level. As he's about to destroy the two boats, Batman fires his gauntlet darts at him, knocking the detonator out of his hands, and throws him over the edge of the building. Before he can hit the ground, however, Batman fires one of his grappling gun tools at him and saves him. While hanging in front of Batman, the Joker tells him that the two of them are destined to fight forever, and how Batman really IS incorruptible. The Joker reveals to him, however, that his real plan was to engineer the fall of Gotham's White Knight, Harvey Dent, since that would introduce much more chaos when a good man like Dent is shown descending into chaos and evil. Batman heads off to find Harvey, while the SWAT team captures the Joker.At 250 52nd St, Gordon arrives to see Two-Face holding his family hostage. Two-Face knocks him to the ground and tells him that he's going to make him suffer just as he did, as he grabs his young son Jimmy and prepares to flip the coin for his fate. Batman arrives and tells him to stop, and to blame the people responsible for Rachel's death. So then Two-Face flips the coin for Batman, which lands on the dirty, scarred side, and Two-Face shoots him. He then flips the coin for himself and it lands on the clean side. As he's flipping the coin for Gordon's son, he tells Gordon to lie to the boy and tell him that everything will be alright, just as Dent himself had to tell Rachel earlier, seconds before she was killed. Batman gets up and tackles him and they fall off of the building together. Unseen by them, the coin lands on the clean side. Batman hands Jimmy up to Gordon as Batman himself falls to the ground next to Two-Face, who lies motionless.As Gordon climbs down to check on Batman, Batman laments that, in the end, the Joker won. By corrupting Harvey Dent and turning him evil, he tore down the best of them. If Gotham were to find out about Dent's murders, then the symbol of hope and faith he had given Gotham would diminish and all the prisoners he helped put back in jail would be let out, thus creating chaos. Batman explains that Gotham can never find out about the murders, and takes the blame of them on himself, so that the Joker wouldn't win and the city's peace would remain.We see a montage of Commissioner Gordon and other members of the Gotham City Police Department gathered at a memorial to Harvey Dent. It is unclear whether he was killed or not. Gordon then smashes the Bat Signal above the MCU Building, while Alfred burns Rachel's note and Lucius shuts down the sonar machine with a pleased look. Batman, in the background, continues to explain that by taking the blame of the killings, the faith that the people of Gotham had in Harvey Dent can be rewarded, and they can feel justified.Batman then runs from Gordon as the cops begin to chase him, and Gordon tells his son that while Harvey Dent was the hero Gotham needed, Batman is the hero that Gotham deserved. The bat-signal is destroyed and a manhunt is issued for Batman. Batman gets on his Batpod and speeds away, while Gordon declares:He's a silent Guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.

title: The Return of Doctor X
synopsis: Nervy New York Morning-Dispatch reporter Walter 'Wichita' Garrett [Wayne Morris]
has just scored an interview with prominent stage star Angela Merrova [Lya Lys], who
has invited him to her apartment in the Park Vista Hotel. When Walt gets
there, he finds to his horror that Miss Merrova has been murdered. Someone
has stabbed her right under the heart and left her body lying on her
bedroom floor. With a scoop like this, Walt calls in the story to his
newspaper even before he calls the police. Before Detective Lieutenant Roy
Kincaid [Charles Wilson] arrives on the scene, the Morning-Dispatch has headlined the
murder in their extra edition. But, when Kincaid arrives at Miss Merrova's
apartment, the body has disappeared. The next day Merrova shows up at the
newspaper with the announcement that she's suing them for $100,000 for the
damage to her reputation due to false reports of her death. Not to mention
that the Park Vista Hotel also intends to sue for defamation to their
reputation. To top it all off, Walt is called on the carpet by his angry
boss and finds himself out of a job.Trying to find answers to how a person can be stabbed to death and
then show up alive, Walt pays a visit to his friend, Doctor Mike Rhodes [Dennis Morgan], a
surgeon at Jules Memorial Hospital. When Walt explains how he found
Merrova with a stab wound just under her heart, Mike admits that it's
unlikely she could survive. If the wound itself didn't kill her, she would
quickly bleed to death. That's it! Walt exclaims, suddenly realizing
that Merrova's corpse was dead white, as if all the blood had been drained
from her body, but where was the blood? Extreme pallor couldn't set in
that quickly, says Mike. Walt remembers that when he saw Merrova that
morning in the boss's office, she was as pale then as when he saw her as a
corpse.Mike offers to speak to Doctor Flegg [John Litel], the hospital's reknown
hematologist, In the meantime, however, Mike has problems of his own.
Stanley Rodgers [John Ridgely], the professional blood donor for Doctor Flegg's 10 AM
surgery has not shown up. Nurse Joan Vance [Rosemary Lane] has telephoned him and found
that he overslept but would be right over. Time passes, however, and
Rodgers still doesn't show. Mike doesn't know it, but Rodgers is never
going to show...he's dead. Dr Flegg has arrived, and the surgery is ready
to go. With no Rodgers, however, there is no blood donor. Furthermore,
Rodgers has Type I blood; only one in 700 people have that blood type.
Fortunately, nurse Joan is Type I and offers to step in for Rodgers.The surgery goes well. When Mike checks on Joan's condition, she is
still feeling a bit weak, so Mike asks her for a date tomorrow night. Mike
is suddenly called by the police and asked to come immediately to 438 Gore
Street. Since Walt is standing next to him and overhears everything, he
tags along. When they get there, they find Stanley Rodgers has been
stabbed near the heart and all the blood drained from his body...same as
Angela Merrova. Furthermore, the wound is so clean and precise that it
doesn't look like a stab wound at all; in fact, it looks like it was made
with a surgical instrument. Oddly enough, the coroner has identified blood
stains on the carpet as being from Group IV, which is impossible, as
Rodgers was definitely Group I. Thinking the coroner might have made a
mistake, Mike takes a sample of the blood to re-analyze.Back in the laboratory, Mike learns that the blood sample is
definitely NOT from Rodgers...nor from any human. In fact, Mike's opinion
is that it isn't even from an animal. Tired out from the day's activities,
Mike says goodnight to Walt and heads home to sleep. First, however, he
decides to take the blood sample over to Dr. Flegg's house, not knowing
that Walt is tailing him. As Walt peeks in through an open window, Mike
waits for Flegg in his laboratory. where he is joined by a strange looking
man with a pasty complexion and a skunklike stripe of white hair down the
center of his head. The man introduces himself as Flegg's assistant,
Doctor Marshall Quesne [Humphrey Bogart]. As Quesne is just about to talk with Mike about
the study of blood composition, Flegg returns. Obeying Mike's request to
take a look at the blood sample, Flegg pronounces it Type IV human blood
showing the usual chemical changes accompanying post-mortem coagulation.
Mike wonders whether the blood has an artificial quality. Quesne, who has
been listening to the conversation, suddenly breaks a glass beaker that
he's been holding. Reiterating once again that the blood sample is Type
IV, Flegg shows Mike the door.Just as Walt is about to leave his perch at the window, a taxi drives
up and Angela Merrova gets out. Wondering why Merrova would be visiting
Flegg, Walt continues to peek in the window. He watches as Merrova enters
Flegg's examination room and promptly faints. When she comes to, she
complains of feeling cold, faint, and being unable to catch her breath.
You're a failure, Quesne challenges Flegg. Flegg orders him out, then
procedures to hook up Merrova for a blood transfusion.The next day, Walt drops in on Mike and tells him what he saw through
the window. Walt is certain that he's seen Quesne somewhere, but he can't
remember where. At that moment, Flegg walks into Mike's office and asks to
speak to him alone. After Walt has left, Flegg asks Mike to forget
everyone he met and everything he saw last night at Flegg's house. He also
asks for the name and address of the nurse that provided the Type I blood
for yesterday's transfusion. When Flegg has exited, Walt returns. He tells
Mike about seeing Angela Merrova last night at Flegg's house and watching
him give her a blood transfusion. Mike suggests that they have a talk with
Merrova and plan to meet at her apartment that night at 9 PM. Remembering
his date with Joan, Mike agrees to bring her along; they can go to Club El
Ray afterwards.When they arrive that evening at Merrova's suite, they find her
languished on her settee, awaiting Dr Flegg. When she orders them out but
collapses in her chaise, Mike assumes his role as doctor, finding her
hands as cold as ice. He instructs Walt to pour her a shot of whiskey. The
whiskey seems to revive her, and she responds to Mike and Walt's
questions. She admits to being of Type I blood. She also tells them what
happened the morning she was murdered. After speaking on the telephone
with Walt, she became aware of someone in her room. Then a hand went over
her mouth, and she felt a sharp pain in her chest. After that, she lost
consciousness and has no recollection of what happened to her until the
next morning when she awoke in her own bedroom. She agrees to meet Walt
tomorrow morning at 10 AM and talk more about it then. Just then, Dr
Quesne, acting in Flegg's stead, enters the room.While on the way to drop Mike and Joan at the El Ray, Walt makes a
quick stop at his boss's house to tell him about Merrova's admission that
she was stabbed and to let him know that she plans to visit the paper in
the morning and tell them all about it. Excited at having his newspaper
exhonerated, the boss telephones the paper and orders them to hold the
presses for a news bulletin. He is surprised to find that a news flash has
just been issued...Merrova is dead, this time for sure. In fact, she's on
her way to Bixby's Undertaking Parlor, screams the boss as he tosses Walt
out the front door.Not willing to believe that Merrova is truly dead without seeing her
body, Walt and Mike head over to the undertaker. While Walt keeps the
undertaker busy, Mike examines Merrova. She's dead all right, he tells
Walt after they've left the parlor. Apparently, she died of natural
causes, and it was Flegg who called the undertaker to pick up the body.
Being as how it's after 1 AM by now and Joan is still sitting in the car,
they all head over to Gus's for hamburgers.The next morning Angela Merrova's death is in all the papers. Walt
goes over to the newspaper office and gets his buddy Pinky [Hunz Hall] to give him
access to the clippings files. After searching everything from A-W, Walt
starts in on X, and there it is! Marshall Quesne is Dr. Maurice J. X
Xavier, a prominent surgeon who was given the death penalty for his
experiments in which he allowed a baby to starve to death. According to
the newspaper clippings, Dr X was electrocuted two years earlier. Just to
be sure that the execution actually took place, Walt contacts the warden
who assures him that Dr X was indeed electrocuted, Dr Flegg claimed the
body, and Dr X now lies buried in Greenlawn Cemetery. Walt and Mike head
over to the Cemetery where, with the help of the cemetery caretaker, they
find Xavier's grave and dig it up. The coffin is empty.Walt is convinced that Flegg is guilty, but Mike isn't; they agree to
give Flegg a chance to explain. Flegg obliges, admitting that Quesne and
Xavier are the same person and that he has found a way to bring a dead man
back to life. He demonstrates the procedure on a dead rabbit. First, it is
necessary to prepare the rabbit by electrocuting him and decoagulating the
blood, something that the electric chair had already done for Dr X when he
came dead to Flegg. Next, he moves the rabbit over to another table where
he begins to transfuse ordinary rabbit blood into the rabbit. Then he adds
his special formula--a compound ester in which essential blood salts have
been precipitated. After charging it electrically, he injects it into the
transfusion tubing. Within a few moments, the rabbit has been revived.
Mike and Walt are understandably astounded.This is essentially the same thing that was done to Dr X following
his death, explains Flegg. Although Dr X was a convicted murderer, he was
also a medical genius, and Flegg admits that he needed Dr X's help for
further research. However, after returning a person to life, there is the
further problem of sustaining it. A second project Flegg has been working
on is to create synthetic blood. That's the blood I found in Merrova's
body and in Rodger's apartment, exclaims Mike. The problem, Flegg
explains, is that the synthetic blood fails to recreate itself, which
means that Quesne stays alive by killing for human blood. And the blood he
needs is Type I. May God forgive me, Flegg hangs his head. I've created
a monster.No one has noticed that Dr. X has been listening at the window. When
Mike and Walt leave Flegg's house but are stopped outside by Lt Kincaid,
Quesne shoots Flegg and steals his list of Type I blood donors. Just
before he dies, Flegg tells Mike and Walt that Quesne has taken the list.
Knowing that Joan's name is on that list, Mike, Walt, and Kincaid go
looking for her, leaving Kincaid's assistant to care for Flegg.Unfortunately for Joan, Dr X is faster. Quesne tracks her down and
convinces her that he's been sent by Mike to take her to Flegg's home.
Joan goes willingly into a cab with him, until she realizes that they
aren't headed towards Flegg's house. Meanwhile, Mike and Walt have
discovered that Quesne went off in a cab with Joan and was overheard
telling the cabby to take them to Jersey. Walt remembers one of the
newspaper clippings that mentioned an abandoned duck club just outside of
Newark, the place where Dr X starved that baby. Walt, Mike, and Kincaid
head for Jersey.As Dr X prepares to exsanguinate Joan, Mike, Walt, and the cops
arrive. As Dr X comes at Joan with a scalpel, she screams, and the police
open fire. Dr X tries to escape via the roof, but he is shot down by the
police. As he lay dying, Dr X tells Walt to tell Dr Rhodes that they'll
have to postpone their talk on blood composition.Epilogue: Walt has been reinstated at the Morning-Dispatch, and his
heroic efforts have been rewarded by the mayor and district attorney. The
boss [Joseph Crehan] is now begging Walt to stay with the newspaper, but Walt has decided
to return to Wichita and refuses to sign a contract...until the pretty new
secretary brings it into the office. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]

title: Beautiful Girls
synopsis: Willie Conway (Timothy Hutton) finishes the last few notes of a set at an NYC bar, and counts his tips from a glass on the piano. He takes his change and heads out into the cold winter night to take a Greyhound coach across the border for a High School reunion back where he grew up.His old twenty-something High School buddies haven't moved on with their lives. Tommy 'Birdman' Rowland (Matt Dillon) and Paul Kirkwood (Michael Rapaport) own a snow-plough business, and hire their friend Kev (Max Perlich) to lend a hand. They each have their issues - Bird, the old High School quarterback, is having an affair with his old High School sweetheart, Darian Smalls (Lauren Holly) ... who happens to be married, and has a daughter. Paul couldn't commit to his ex, Jan (Martha Plimpton), but when she moved on to be with 'Victor the meat-cutter', he is filled with jealousy and blocks her driveway with snow every night.Michael 'Mo' Morris (Noah Emmerich) is the only old buddy who has matured - he is married with 2 kids, and is content with life it seems.Mo picks up Willie from the coach station and drops him off home. He has a lonely house since his mom died - leaving behind a heart-broken old man, and Willie's wayward younger brother Bobby (David Arquette). Outside, Willie sees for the first time his young neighbor, Marty (Natalie Portman), making a snowman.After hanging out with his pals, next day he meets Marty again - who gives him some snow-shovelling advice, which breaks the ice (get it? ok, not that great) in their friendship. She likes his burns.Paul buys a ring for his ex-girlfriend Jan and proposes. But it's too little, too late. And the diamond has a brown tint to it. she flat refuses, and he is heart-broken.That night, the old friends meet at a reopened bar in town, managed by Stanley 'Stinky' Womack (a much slimmer Pruitt Taylor Vince). Already Paul argues with Birdman, who doesn't take kindly to his advice, and then the others.Next day, Marty and Willie meet again. She asks if he has a girlfriend. He tells her that he is seeing somebody - a girl called Tracy. Marty asks if they have plans to get married. Willie has been reluctant to commit, and doesn't want to stick around to hear relationship advice from a 13year old.Meanwhile, Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon (Mira Sorvino), has had another jealous fight with Tommy (she knows about Darian). She asks her friends for advice. They tell her to ditch him, but instead, as it's his birthday soon, she wants to try one more time and salvage the relationship. They reluctantly agree to help her throw a surprise party.The old friends, including Mo, are back in the bar again when in walks Stanley's cousin, Andera (Uma Thurman - what a cast!! Who was the casting agent on this one, again?!). The men all fall for her instantly. They down shots, and Willie is asked to play something. After a little warm-up, the boys break into Sweet Caroline.Next day, Birdman and Willie are invited to a long, and random, lecture/monologue by Gina (Rosie O'Donnell) about the virtues of real women. Back home, Willie is jealous when he sees that Marty has suddenly got a boyfriend.Sharon throws the surprise birthday party for Tommy. Things are going great - until Darian shows up, drunk, and makes a move on Tommy. Sharon and her friends leave. Tommy drives Darian home, and she makes a move again but Tommy turns her down. Darian is angry, revealing her true character. Instead Tommy tries to patch things up with Sharon, but it's too late.Clearing up after the party, Willie opens up to Mo about his feelings for Marty. Mo puts him straight. Willie is having cold-feet about taking things to the next level with his girlfriend. He knows Marty will be stunning in 10 years time, but it's the beer talking.Willie and Mo head off to the frozen lake the next day with Mo's kids. Willie leaves him to it and joins Paul and Kev in an ice-fishing shack. When he leaves for air, he sees Marty skating with her friends. He goes to say 'hi'. As they talk, he hears that she has finished things with her boyfriend, Andrew, because she has found someone better - Willie. She falls into his arms.Willie is embarrassed, but a little giddy. Mo almost falls over in shock. Marty asks him to wait for her until she is 18, in 5 years time. But Willie tells her that it would be unfair to wait - she still has a lot of maturing to do and in 5 years will have forgotten about him, while he'll still be waiting. He doesn't want to be the Winnie the Pooh to her Christopher Robbin - as he knows that is how the story ended, when Christopher outgrew Pooh. She skates away.Paul somehow manages to score a date with Andera. He takes her to a bar - the same one which Jan is at the bar with Victor. Andera, as a favour, flirts with him - but when Paul tries to score a kiss she smacks him and leaves. She walks home alone, turning down an advance from Tommy on the way.Paul is still upset, and gives Willie a talk about why he prefers models - the promise of a better life. Meanwhile Tommy meets Darian in the library, who asks him to go to the reunion, where things will be like they were before. That night, Willie drowns his sorrows at the bar. He is joined by Andera. After two unsuccessful attempts to leave with him, she gives in and they go to the ice shack.Andera has a boyfriend.

Willie has feelings for her again. Marty is heart-broken. Willie has kind words for her -- he wants to keep in touch whatever happens, because he knows she will grow up to be an amazing person.The guys have a pre-reunion party at Mo's. Tommy has decided to do the right thing and avoid Darian - and miss the reunion. Instead he heads down to the bar - and bumps into Steve, Darian's husband, and his frat buddies.Meanwhile Darian is at the reunion, alone. She is confronted by a man who had/has a weight problem, and says that although she was something to look at, she was as mean as a snake.After he refuses to be bought a drink, suddenly Steve opens up and tells him he knows about what has happened with his wife. They are going to settle it outside - Tommy doesn't believe Steve to be a man to fight his own battles. After a little insult he leaves ... and is followed by the four men. He gets in a few good punches, but is smacked over the head with a rock and then held while each man gets a free punch, and then kicked while he lies on the ground.He is found by the barman, who phones Mo. The boys race over to the bar to find a badly-beaten Tommy. Immediately they get back into the truck and head over to Steve's house. Steve calls his friends.

title: The Truman Show
synopsis: Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is an insurance salesman leading an idyllic, peaceful life on Seahaven Island.Truman also happens to be the star of the most popular live show in television history. The only problem is, he doesn't know it! In fact, the entire island of Seahaven is a complete fabrication; a massive set surrounded by a protective dome that produces the most sophisticated effects and imagery to mimic the sky, weather, and temperature of the real world. Set just off of what appears to be the coast of Florida, the dome is run by a massive staff hidden just beyond its barriers and managed by the artistically eccentric Director, Christof (Ed Harris). Christof has filmed Truman since just before his birth and sees the project as a ray of hope; a way to truthfully portray a person's life nonstop while maintaining their innocence.It is on Day 10,909 of Truman's life that things begin to change. As he's getting ready for work, he greets his neighbors across the street (Fritz Dominique, Angel Schmiedt, and Nastassja Schmiedt), with his traditional greeting of, Good morning! And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night, before a mysterious object falls from the sky and lands near his car. When Truman looks up, however, the sky is clear and offers no explanation for the object, which we can see is obviously a studio light. As he drives to work, the radio reports that an aircraft flying over the island shed parts which leads Truman to believe that was the source of the fallen object. At work, Truman discreetly tears pieces of paper out of a magazine and stows them away before making a call asking for directory information to Fiji. He asks for a Lauren or Silvia Garland. When neither of the names bears results he hangs up just as his boss, Lawrence (Peter Krause), approaches and asks him to close a deal on Harbor Island. Reluctantly, Truman leaves but once he reaches the pier he is forced to return to work due to his fear of open water.At home Truman spends some time gardening before his wife, Meryl (Laura Linney), returns from work with a chipper smile on her face. Afterwards, Truman visits with his long time friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich), real name Louis Coltrane, where he confides the wish to leave Seahaven, quit his job, and travel to Fiji, echoing a childhood wish to explore (despite his teacher's (Muriel Moore) attempts to dissuade him by informing him that there was nothing left in the world to discover). Marlon feigns ignorance and says that he doesn't even know where Fiji is.That evening, Truman sits alone on the beach looking out towards the water. He remembers a boating trip he took with his father (Brian Delate) as a child (Blair Slater) and requesting that they stay out at sea for just a bit longer. Though his father wanted to go back to shore, he complied. Shortly after, a strong storm hit and Truman's father was swept overboard and drowned. As he comes out of the memory it begins to rain on Truman...and just on Truman. When he realizes this, he stands up in shock as the rest of the sky finally opens up in a downpour, prompting him to rush home.He tells Meryl about his plans to go to Fiji but she dismisses the idea, saying that their financial obligations are much more important. When he argues that it could be an adventure she counters by asking if having a baby would be a good adventure. She then suggests they go to bed. The following morning, as Truman drives to work, he spots a homeless man on the street. Looking closely he realizes that the man looks just like his father. Before he can get to the man, however, a number of people and strange obstacles spontaneously appear and the homeless man is taken away. Later that day, Truman questions his mother (Holland Taylor) about this over the phone but she refuses to believe any of it and dismisses the idea as wishful thinking.That night, Truman retreats to the basement of his home where he begins to look through an old trunk filled with his personal mementos. He spies a red sweater with a white pin that says 'How will it end?' His memories bring him back to college where he and Marlon are in the homecoming band. Truman has his eye on an attractive young woman across the courtyard but is distracted when Meryl shows up. Over the next month or so, Meryl is inseparable from Truman until one evening when he is in the library studying. He looks up and sees the young woman from the courtyard whom he'd been admiring. He approaches her and learns that her name is Lauren (Natascha McElhone) but she tells him that she's not allowed to speak with him. Despite this, Truman asks if she'd like to go out with him sometime. She takes out a small piece of paper, writes quickly, and hands it to Truman. It says one word, 'now'. The two secretly rush out of the library. The cameras around the room lose them for a second but manage to spy them running out a nearby exit.Truman and Lauren run towards the beach where they are able to share a moment of privacy. However, a vehicle approaches and Lauren becomes frantic. She tells Truman that her real name is actually Sylvia and tries to tell him the truth about the show as her 'father' appears on the dunes and calls for her. He comes down to collect her and tells Truman that she's delusional before announcing that they are moving to Fiji. Truman can only watch in puzzlement as they drive off, never to return. In the aftermath, Truman finds the red sweater that Lauren/Sylvia left behind.As he returns from his memory, Truman takes the scraps of magazine that he'd been tearing out at work and reveals that he's been compiling a collage of a woman's face; Lauren/Sylvia's face as he remembers it.The next day, as he drives to work, the radio in Truman's car begins to strangely broadcast every movement he makes, which are actually remarks from crew members observing him. Growing increasingly paranoid, Truman opts to walk around in the open air outside. He parks and ducks into a building. He makes his way towards the elevator and, as the doors open, is surprised to see, not an empty car, but an entrance to what seems to be a studio filled with people wearing headphones and eating sandwiches - the actors' break room. Before he can register what he's seeing, security grabs him and pushes him out of the building for trespassing.Confused, Truman walks to a nearby market where he sees Marlon's service vehicle parked. Truman tries to explain to Marlon what he just experienced but Marlon passes it off as Truman trying to be funny. Truman pulls Marlon aside and tells him that he's his best friend and needs to confide that he's going to be going away for a while.When he returns home, Truman finds Meryl and his mother looking at photos in an old album. They show him and look on together as the TV begins to play an old film called 'Show Me the Way to Go Home', a clear attempt to reassure the notion of never leaving home. As Truman looks back at the photo album, his eyes fall on a picture of his wedding day with Meryl. Looking closer, he sees that her fingers are crossed which implies that Meryl did not marry Truman truthfully.Truman goes to a travel agency the next day to book a flight to Fiji but the agent (Judy Clayton) tells him that there are no available flights for at least a month. When he tries to take a bus to Chicago, the bus breaks down before it can leave the station.When Meryl comes home from work, she finds Truman sitting in his car in the driveway, fixated on something. She goes to the car and sits with him but he tells her to be silent before predicting the appearance of every person along the street; as if they were on a fixed schedule - specifically, a lady on a red bike, a man with flowers, and a vintage Volkswagen beetle with a dented fender. Meryl tells him that his behavior is worrying but he decides to put his theory to a bigger test. He drives off down the street with Meryl who demands that they return home. When they come to a rotary, a traffic jam suddenly appears. Truman feigns disappointment and takes the car around the rotary multiple times. When he comes back to the blocked road all the cars have vanished and he continues towards the only bridge that leads off the island. However, Truman is forced to stop at the bridge when he realizes that he can't drive over because of his fear of water. Instead, he closes his eyes and slams his foot on the gas, forcing Meryl to drive. Victorious, Truman cries out as Meryl continues to try and convince him to return home. They pass a sign warning of forest fires and a line of flames shoots across the road, but Truman drives onward. The car is finally stopped just beyond a power plant that appears to have experienced a meltdown. Men in hazmat suits approach the car and apologize for the inconvenience but when one of them accidentally calls Truman by his first name (they would of course not know otherwise) Truman gets out of the car and attempts to make a break for it. The men chase after him and manage to capture him and return him to the island.Once home, Meryl tries to console a dejected Truman by offering him a new drink she picked up. However, she promotes the item as if on a commercial which prompts Truman to ask who she thinks she's talking to. Meryl becomes upset and blames Truman's recent behavior but Truman becomes more frantic and tries to convince Meryl that there's something wrong with everything. Becoming scared, Meryl takes a peeler and aims it at Truman, telling him to keep his distance. When he grabs it away from her and puts her in a lock hold she calls out for 'someone' to stop him. Truman, in shock, releases her and demands to know what's going on. Marlon appears at the door and walks in with a case of beer, as if to casually hang out, and Meryl runs into his arms, crying that 'it's not professional'.Marlon takes Truman out where they sit at the edge of a road, sharing the beers. Marlon tries to assure Truman that, if everyone was in on a massive scheme or conspiracy, he'd have to be in on it too. He tells Truman that the last thing he would ever want to do is lie to him, though in reality, he's saying this as Christof feeds him his words through an earpiece. Marlon then tells Truman the real reason he stopped by and took him out tonight. They stand and look behind them where a dark figure emerges from the mist. Marlon tells Truman that he was able to find the homeless man he'd seen and, as the man gets closer, Truman realizes that it is his father. The two embrace while Christof composes the cinematography from above and revels in his master shot of Truman weeping with happiness. Truman's father promises to make up for all the lost years.Shortly after this moment a weekly TV show titled 'TruTalk' begins while a smaller screen in the right-hand corner of the television shows Truman as he eats his breakfast. Christof is interviewed and he explains the reasoning behind many things that have happened on the show. The purpose of 'killing' his father out at sea was to implant the fear of water in Truman so that he would have no wish of leaving the island. This decision was reinforced by his youthful wishes to explore and discover which often nearly led him to discover his own captivity. Bringing his father back now was done with the hopes to quell Truman's emotional turmoil and soothe him into remaining on the island despite all that's happened. Various security measures were taken in light of a few occurrences, one of which involved a Truman fan (Marco Rubeo) hiding himself in a Christmas present of Truman's when he was a child in order to get air-time.A caller rings in and Christof accepts to answer questions. He recognizes Sylvia's voice as she berates Christof for keeping up the charade and imprisoning Truman within a mockery of life. Christof counters by saying that the real world is a prison and that what he has done is to actually give Truman the chance to lead a completely normal life, free of violence or pain and says that, should Truman discover the truth, he could leave.The following day, Truman appears to be well and back to his normal self. He greets his neighbors and heads off to work where he meets a new coworker named Vivien (Meryl's appointed replacement as Truman's prospective female partner). That evening, Truman moves some things around his basement, appearing to reorganize, before pulling on some covers on a makeshift bed and falling asleep. After several hours of inactivity, even when Truman should be awake, Christof becomes suspicious while watching the video feed. He orders that the phone ring in the house. When Truman doesn't answer, much less move, Christof sends Marlon over, cueing him the entire time as to what to do. Marlon goes into the basement and pulls Truman's covers back to find a noise recorder and a gaping hole in the basement floor. At a loss of what to do or say, Christof does the unthinkable; he cuts the transmission.The cease in transmission puts the world into a state of shock and Christof orders the entire staff on the island to form search parties. Performing a God-like move over the set, Christof commands the sun to rise to aid in the search. When the search on land has been exhausted, Christof suggests an impossible idea; search at sea. His intuition proves correct as cameras pan over the ocean and locate a lone sailboat with Truman at the helm. The live video feeds continue and Christof orders one of the actors to go out and fetch Truman. However, being actors, none of them know how to man a boat.Christof utilizes his weather program to simulate a storm to entice Truman to go back to port. However, Truman battens down and yells to the skies in defiance. Angry, Christof increases the wind and turbulence, nearly causing Truman to fall overboard. Knowing that Truman will never back down, Christof pull the plug on the weather. Truman continues sailing, victorious, until the boat is rocked by a strong impact. Truman collects himself and finds that the bow of the ship has lodged into...the sky. He has come to the end of the dome. He gets off of the boat and examines the wall, following it a short ways until he finds a short staircase leading to an exit door. As he reaches for the handle, Christof speaks on the intercom system to Truman directly for the first time. He introduces himself as the creator who has been watching Truman since the day he was born and revealing his life as entertainment for a world beyond. Christof tries to convince Truman to stay within his world where he can live happily and without suffering or pain and tries to plant the idea that Truman is still deathly afraid of continuing on.Truman appears deep in thought and Christof suggests that he say something. After all, the entire world is watching. Truman looks up and says, In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night. He bows as Christof looks on incredulously, opens the door, and leaves. An elated Sylvia jumps up from her living room floor and leaves her apartment as the rest of the world cheers tremendously at the finale of the Truman Show.A saddened but resolute Christof removes his head piece and cuts the transmission.

title: Zeder
synopsis: In 1956, Gabriella (Veronica Moriconi)—a girl with apparent psychic powers—is brought to the enormous house of Dr. Meyer (Cesare Barbetti) in Chartres, France. Meyer intends to conduct an experiment testing her abilities. He takes her into his basement, where the youngster abruptly falls to her knees and begins digging into the dirt. This is where you're hiding, isn't it? Meyer yells. He rushes upstairs for help from his assistants and leaves Gabriella by herself. She is attacked by something unseen and is taken to the hospital. In the basement, further digging reveals a rotted corpse, with a nearby wallet identifying the dead man as Paolo Zeder. Dr. Meyer realizes that the earth in which Zeder was buried was a 'K-Zone'.
In present day Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old typewriter as a birthday present by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the typewriter's ribbon. As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zones—areas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead.
Stefano investigates the message left on the typewriter ribbon. He encounters people who make it clear that they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences. A nearby service station attendant tells Stefano that French investors are building a gigantic hotel on the property, but no work is ever seen being done.
Stefano sneaks onto the property, and discovers surveillance equipment with numerous monitors showing the dead face of a man buried in a coffin. Stefano watches the monitors. The dead man is Don Luigi Costa, an ex-priest who abandoned his vows after contracting an incurable disease. Continuing Zeder's work, Costa had himself buried on the property, a suspected K-Zone, and his rebirth from the dead is caught on camera. Stefano manages to elude the conspirators involved in the experimental work, but finds his wife has been murdered by them. At night, Stefano buries her in a K-Zone located on the abandoned property. She revives and approaches her husband. In the darkness, Stefano begins screaming horribly.

title: Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief
synopsis: The movie begins with the camera panning over New York City, past Coney Island and along a pier. Water rises from Brighton Beach and coalesces into the form of a huge being looking like a man-- the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd). Poseidon strides through the water along the pier, glancing nonchalantly at a gawking fisherman, and steps onto the streets of New York, shrinking to human size and his garments changing to resemble normal contemporary attire. He arrives at the observation deck of the Empire State building and meets another man there, similarly attired-- his brother Zeus (Sean Bean), king of the Greek gods. Zeus asks Poseidon to look to the sky. Poseidon notes heavy thunderclouds, and Zeus points out there is no lightning-- his master bolt, which gives him control over lightning, has been stolen. Zeus gets directly into Poseidon's face and tells him that he is convinced that Poseidon's son is responsible for the theft. Poseidon insists that his son doesn't know who he is, and warns Zeus about crossing a line, and that if Zeus harms Poseidon's son, he will be in for the fight of his life, but Zeus does not back down. He tells Poseidon that unless the bolt is returned to him by midnight on June 21st, the summer solstice, there will be war.We then see young teenager Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) sitting calmly at the bottom of a swimming pool. On surfacing, he is told by his best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) that he had been underwater nearly seven minutes. Hardly possible for most people, Percy thinks little of it. Being under water helps clear his mind and is one of the few places he can think.Percy and Grover are at school at the Yancy Academy, and we see that Grover uses crutches. They walk through the halls, disgusted as several students fight openly in the halls before it is broken up by faculty. In class, there is a substitute teacher, Mrs. Dodds (Maria Olsen), writing a quote from Othello on the blackboard. She asks the class if anyone can explain the quote. Several students raise their hands, but Mrs. Dodds notices Percy glancing away and calls on him. He looks at the blackboard, blinking as the letters seem to twist and dance around confusingly in front of his eyes. Finally he says he doesn't know the answer.Percy arrives home, kissing his mother, Sally (Catherine Keener), hello. She asks him about school and he is clearly very frustrated. Percy suffers from both dyslexia and ADHD, impairing his school performance. He thought the Yancy Academy was supposed to make things better. Sally tries to assure him that one day, everything will make sense, but he is very dubious.At that moment the door opens and in walks Gabe Ugliano (Joe Pantoliano), Sally's husband and Percy's stepfather. Gabe is bald, paunchy, and dirty, with granny glasses attached to a chain around his neck. He sits at the table and asks where his beer is. Sally says it's in the fridge, but Gabe clearly expects her to bring it to him. Sally complies without a word of complaint, much to Percy's disgust. He insists that Gabe show some respect to Sally. Gabe gets up and leans against the wall close to Percy, and says that it's his house and Percy is the one who needs to show some respect.Gabe retreats to his room and Percy asks Sally why she stays with him. Gabe Ugliano is a crass, crude pig of a man with foul armpit stench, who cannot hold a steady job because of his demeanor and smell. Sally tries to insist that Gabe is good to her and Percy in 'ways he doesn't understand.' Percy can only say that Sally is right-- he doesn't understand.Percy is going with his school class to a museum to look at a gallery of ancient Greek and Roman exhibits. A voiceover from Poseidon tells Percy that everything as he knows it, is about to change. Percy glances around, and Poseidon is seen looking at him across the street, though Percy does not recognize him as he has never seen Poseidon before. A bus moves past Poseidon, in front of him, and he's gone.At a gallery showing sculptures of the Greek gods, a teacher named Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan) is lecturing on them. Mr. Brunner is in a motorized wheelchair, his legs covered in a blanket. Mr. Brunner explains how the gods often came down to Earth and had love affairs-- and sometimes children-- with mortals. He asks Percy if he can tell the class what these children were called. Percy correctly replies, 'demigods.' Mr. Brunner says that many of these demigods became great heroes, such as Hercules and Achilles. He then asks Percy to name another, giving him a hint: he has something in common with this hero.Percy happens to glance up at a wall mural above Mr. Brunner's head. The Ancient Greek writing seems to dance and twist around before Percy's eyes, and to his surprise, he can read it: Perseus. Percy realizes that his own name is similar to Perseus.As Mr. Brunner begins to explain the labors of Hercules and his victory over the Nemean lion, Mrs. Dodds quietly asks if she can speak to Percy alone, away from the other students. She opens a door into an adjacent, unfinished room, and enters behind Percy. But when he turns around, she is standing high up on a scaffolding.In a harsh, grating voice, Mrs. Dodds demands, Where is it? Percy is completely confused, and then confounded as Mrs. Dodds changes into a hideous winged beast with long fangs that swoops down and demands that Percy give her the lightning bolt he stole. Percy is horrified and with no idea as to what is going on. The creature swoops again and seizes Percy, lifting him high up in the air and threatening to bite his heart out unless he returns the stolen lightning bolt.Grover and Mr. Brunner burst into the room, The creature turns, recognizing Mr. Brunner, who demands that it release Percy or he'll tear the creature to pieces. The winged monster drops Percy and crashes through the window, flying off.Percy is sick with disbelief at what happened-- and then even more so as Mr. Brunner turns to Grover and curses himself for not having realized that a Fury was concealed in their school. He asks Percy what the Fury wanted from him, and he shrugs and says that she said something about him stealing a lightning bolt. Mr. Brunner says in a very worried tone, they found him, and Grover looks horrified, confusing Percy even further. Mr. Brunner tells Grover that Percy is no longer safe, and they should move him to the camp. Percy confronts them on talking about him, right in front of him, without talking TO him. Mr. Brunner only hands Percy an object, telling him it is a powerful weapon and he should guard it well. Percy stares in amazement at what, to him, appears to be an ordinary writing pen. Mr. Brunner instructs Grover to bring Percy to Sally and not to take his eyes off of him. Grover nods and urges Percy to come with him. Neither Grover nor Mr. Brunner offer Percy any further answers, so for now he goes with Grover.Hurrying down the street, Grover warns Percy to simply keep walking and not to look at anyone. Percy demands to know why Mr. Brunner wanted Grover to watch Percy, and Grover only says that he is Percy's protector. He insists he is quite capable of doing this despite apparently being on crutches.At Percy's house, Gabe is playing poker with friends while Sally waits on them uncomplainingly. Percy comes in with Grover and urgently tells Sally they need to talk. Gabe crudely tells Percy to beat it, and Percy calls him a bald-headed freak. Gabe jumps up to hit Percy, but Grover slams a crutch down onto his foot and then hits him in the groin with it, which impresses Percy. Grover tells Sally that Percy has to leave immediately. Sally acquiesces and hurries out of the house with him.Driving across a bridge, Sally is no more straight with Percy than Grover or Mr. Brunner had been. She only tells him that she's bringing them to a camp for really special people. She says it's about Percy's father-- his true father.As they drive on, Sally starts to tell Percy about how she met Percy's father... a man she never addresses by name. She says she was truly in love with him, and he loved her and Percy in turn. She admits that Percy's father left, but insists that he was forced to do it, and didn't abandon either of them.As they drive past a field with cows, one horned head rises up, looking much larger than the other cows' heads. Grover suddenly shouts urgently for Sally to watch out. She gapes in horror as the corpse of a cow is suddenly thrown into the road right in front of them. Sally loses control of the car and it flips over.The sound of heavy, ponderous footsteps begin to approach them. Percy stares as Grover removes his pants, revealing that his legs are those of a goat, complete with hooves. Grover uses them to smash through the car windshield so they can all get ouf of the car. The crutches, as he hurriedly says, are just for show-- Grover can walk and run perfectly well, without them. The three of them flee from the approaching horror-- a huge bull-like humanoid. The monster picks up the car and hurls it at them.They arrive at a stone arch surrounded by torches, which Grover says is their destination. As Percy stares up at the arch, Greek lettering dances around before his eyes to form recognizable words: Camp Half Blood. He and Grover dash through the arch... but Sally is unable to pass through; some kind of barrier repels her. She urgently tells Percy that she cannot pass through the gate because she is not like him. Percy refuses to leave without her but Sally begs him to do so. Just then, the huge minotaur grabs Sally from behind, and Percy watches in horror as the monster holds her aloft in one hand. She begs him to run, saying he's safe inside the gate, but Percy insists on facing the monster down. Grover shouts for him to take out the pen Mr. Brunner gave him, and click it. Percy does so and is shocked to see it transform into a Greek sword. The minotaur squeezes Sally and she screams briefly before disappearing in a flash of smoke and gold-colored dust.Enraged, Percy charges at the minotaur, swinging the sword. The minotaur dodges and hurls a punch that blasts Percy into a tree. It charges at him on all fours, and he jumps away. One of the minotaur's horns lodges in the tree, and part of the horn breaks off when it tries to pull it loose. Percy grabs the broken-off horn as the minotaur charges again, and drives it into the monster's middle, killing it. Percy faints and collapses into Grover's arms.He awakens lying in a cot with Grover watching over him. Grover is now clad in a leather vest with a dagger sheathed at his hip. He tells Percy that he is in the camp infirmary and has been unconscious for three days. He asks what Percy remembers. Percy thinks he awoke from a crazy dream, but then glances down and sees Grover's goat-legs and hooves. Grover says that he is a satyr. Percy breaks down in misery realizing everything was real, and his mother is gone. Grover tries to comfort him, saying he feels responsible as it's his job to protect Percy, although he is just a junior protector and doesn't have his horns yet.Grover begins to take Percy around Camp Half Blood. People are seen in a mixture of modern and ancient Greek attire, and are training in combat with Greek weapons-- swords, shields, and bows. Grover finally begins to explain the truth about Percy, much to his continuing disbelief-- Percy is a demigod; one of hundreds throughout the world. Camp Half Blood is where demigods learn to harness their abilities, and while many go to lead normal lives, many go on to become great leaders and heroes, though Percy cannot see himself as a hero. Grover then explains Percy's dyslexia and ADHD-- written letters and words seem to twist and dance around before his eyes because his brain is hardwired to read ancient Greek, not modern English; like back at the museum when he was able to read the Greek writing. And his ADHD is his divine battle reflexes. He was never able to be still, and this is what allowed him to survive-- and prevail, in his battle with the minotaur. As Grover says, no loser (as Percy thinks of himself) can defeat one.Grover brings Percy to a field along a river where the students do most of their battle training. Percy stops and watches a beautiful young woman with long brunette hair battling several students at once-- and winning handily. She wields her sword with a grace and agility that Percy thinks he can only dream of. Percy asks Grover who she is, and he just laughs and warns him that the girl could tear him apart. But he says the girl's name is Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), and she is the daughter of Athena, goddess of wisdom. Still holding her sword at the throat of her last opponent, Annabeth happens to look in their direction, her expression unreadable as she look at Percy, almost as if recognizing him.Grover leads Percy to another field where he sees another amazing sight-- several centaurs engaged in a running exercise. But what's even more amazing is the lead centaur-- Mr. Brunner, or as he explains, here in this world, he is the legendary teacher, Chiron. He apologizes for hiding his true form, but he needed to keep an eye on Percy.As they continue through the camp, Grover is called to by a group of daughters of Aphrodite, goddess of love. Chiron smirks as Grover goes to join them, suggesting to Percy that he knows where it will lead. Chiron brings Percy into a house which he says is Percy's quarters at the camp. The house is filled with nautical objects, and includes a heavy trident. Picking up the trident, looking at it, Percy realizes that some of the walls are carved with a symbol resembling the trident. Understanding dawns on him-- Percy is the son of Poseidon, god of the sea. Chiron says this has been kept from Percy for all these years for his own safety-- for a child to be sired by one of the big three Greek gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) is exceptionally rare, and as the son of Poseidon, Percy is one of the most powerful of the demigods, which makes him a threat to the Olympian gods. Chiron then explains that Sally knew all of this, and the reason she married Ugliano was that his foul armpit stench hid and masked the smell of Percy's blood from anything that the gods could have sent to eliminate him. Percy is quiet and thoughtful as he realizes how much Sally sacrificed for him-- why she tolerated Gabe's treatment of her so gracefully.Chiron then finally tells Percy about the reference to him as the lightning thief-- Zeus' lightning bolt is the most powerful weapon ever created. Zeus' belief that Percy stole it centers aorund a very valid worry that it could pose a threat to Zeus' station as ruler of all the gods. Chiron warns Percy in a dire tone, that in ten days, if the bolt is not returned, the resulting war between Zeus and Poseidon would force all of Olympus to choose sides, and Earth would be torn asunder. Chiron plans to bring Percy to Olympus and make an appeal directly to Zeus as to Percy's innocence. As to why they can't go right now-- outside the gates are dangers; the Fury and the Minotaur being only the beginning. First, Percy needs to train so he will be able to handle these dangers.Grover and Percy are heading to the training field; Percy suited up properly in leather and mail armor and feeling very awkward in it. Chiron orders all the students to fall in and gather around him. He introduces Percy to all the other students and says he will need a team. Stepping forth to volunteer to take him, is Luke (Jake Abel), son of Hermes and camp leader. Luke is a bit cocky and a bit of a jokester but takes to Percy right off. He gives Percy a helmet and welcomes him to his team-- the Blue soldiers. Chiron then orders all the students to prepare for game of Capture the Flag-- Ancient Greek style.The two armies rush forth on command, swords and shields clashing. Luke tells Percy that he knows where the enemy flag is and to follow him. Ambushed by several Sons of Ares fighting for the red team, Luke and Percy fend them off, Percy amazed at having knocked out two of them. Luke urges Percy to hurry to the red flag while he holds off the rest of the Sons of Ares.Percy hurries to a stream, where he removes his helmet and kneels to take a drink. But before he sips the water, he looks up and sees the red flag, completely unguarded, just across the stream. Grabbing his sword, he rushes in delight over to the banner.But one red soldier is there to meet him-- Annabeth. The daughter of Athena quickly deals Percy several slash wounds and knocks him about the stream bank, seemingly toying with him. Chiron, Grover, Luke and a number of soldiers from both teams find their way there. Annabeth slashes Percy again and again, and kicks him down to the ground. The red soldiers cheer and gloat as she walks back to them.Suddenly Percy hears his father's voice telling him to go to the water, and it will give him power. Slowly, painfully, he crawls to the stream. Everyone turns and looks as he dips his hand into the water. Curiosity turns to surprise and then shock as the water flows up his arm and shoulder, and over his whole body, healing all his wounds. Percy climbs to his feet, surging with new power and strength, and makes a beeline for Annabeth, easily swatting aside all Red soldiers that try to stop him. Quickly the tip of his sword is at her throat, and she looks at him in amazement. Regaining her focus, Annabeth bats Percy's sword aside and they fight once again. But this time Percy matches her, strike for strike, parry for parry. They grapple at close quarters and Percy wrests her sword from her grip, putting its blade to the back of her neck, and the point of his own sword to her throat as Grover and Chiron clap excitedly.Annabeth surrenders, looking at Percy with a mixture of surprise at her defeat and admiration for the power he wields. He returns her sword and marches to the red flag. Nobody stands in his way as he plants his sword in the stream bank and lifts the red flag up high over his head in victory, the blue soldiers all cheering and applauding.In the evening at dinner, Percy is approached by several nymphs inviting him to a party at their quarters. As he fills his cup, Annabeth comes up to fills hers, and they talk. Annabeth explains to Percy that her mother and his father have been long time enemies for many centuries. She says she has strong feelings for Percy, but hasn't decided if they're amicable or hostile yet.The dinner feast is interrupted by the arrival of a massive, terrible winged demon appearing through a bonfire-- Hades. Hades calls Percy out and tells him that Sally is alive and well, but she is his prisoner, and he will release her to Percy only if he brings Hades the lightning bolt.After Hades vanishes, Percy wants to travel to the underworld to negotiate Sally's release, thinking Hades will have no reason to hold her once Percy explains he didn't steal the ilghtning bolt and doesn't have it. But Chiron warns him that Hades doesn't work that way, and will kill both him and Sally. He insists that Percy stick to the original plan of appealing directly to Zeus first, and then they can formulate plans to rescue Sally.Later that night, Grover finds Percy preparing to leave camp to set out for the Underworld, determined to rescue his mother. When Grover finds he cannot dissuade Percy, he insists on coming along, this being his job as Percy's protector. Annabeth also wants to come along. She's trained many years at the camp, but that's all she's done-- she's never embarked on an actual quest and hardly gotten to see the outside world. In addition, she's won a great many more battles than Percy, so her experience will come in handy. Percy is reluctant at first but then assents to their going with him.The first puzzle is reaching the underworld... none of them knows how to get there. But Annabeth believes she knows who would.The three of them visit Luke at his quarters, finding him playing video games. Luke's quarters are decked out with a lot of amenities from the modern world, including electronics, which he prefers over the Renaissance Fair decor of the camp. Annabeth knows that Luke's father, Hermes, as the messenger of the gods, has traveled to the underworld many times, and she asks if he knows anything about how to get there. Luke says he doesn't speak to his father and doesn't at all care for him ('we all have daddy issues,' he explains), but he says he broke into his father's house once and has some things that may help them. One is a pair of flying winged shoes, one of hundreds of pairs Hermes owns and uses to travel. Another is a map that will help locate three of the Pearls of Persephone. Luke explains that Persephone is more a prisoner of Hades than his wife, and she is miserable there. For comfort and companionship, she has many paramours and lovers. She gives them the pearls as a means of leaving the underworld unnoticed by Hades-- one needs only to crush a pearl underfoot and concentrate on where to go.The map will help them find three of the pearls that are hidden in the United States. It shows one pearl located in a Garden Emporium owned by someone named Auntie Em, and located in Leeds Point, New Jersey. When the pearl is found, the map will show the location of the next one. When all three pearls are collected, the map will show where they can find a secret entrance to the underworld.As a final gift, Luke asks Percy to take his favorite shield, saying it will be of help to him.Percy, Grover and Annabeth catch a bus and make their way to Auntie Em's garden Emporium. They find it seemingly unoccupied and nearly delapidated; what appears to be an icebox with free soft drinks only contains a nest of rats. There are a lot of stone statues around. Annabeth notices a stone fountain with a number of Greek gold drachmas, meaning they're on the right track. She gives them to Percy. The three decide to split up and search the whole Emporium, hoping to find the pearl.Annabeth walks past more statues, eerily carved as if cowering in terror from whatever they are pointed to face. Suddenly a strange, middle-aged woman rushes up out of nowhere, hysterically begging for her help. Barely coherent, she only manages to get out that she and her husband stopped for directions. She grabs Annabeth's forearm, hysterically begging for Annabeth to come and help her.Grover finds his way to a shed where one of the statues is of a satyr, which strongly resembles his uncle Ferdinand. In fact, it's a near perfect stone replica of him, right down to the mole on his forehead. Grover muses, deciding it can't be his actual uncle, because he was killed by...Grover freezes in horror. His uncle was killed when he was turned to stone by Medusa. Auntie *EM's* Emporium... M for Medusa. Frantically he rushes to find Annabeth and Percy. Percy hears Grover's frantic yells that they are all in trouble. He grabs his pen and activates it as his sword and rushes to rendezvous with him. Meanwhile, Annabeth is still being pulled by her wrist, by the hysterical woman, who is screaming that they have to leave before she finds them... a woman who turned her husband to stone.The scene switches back and forth a few times between Percy and Grover, running through the Emporium grounds trying to find each other... and find each other they do, literally running smack into each other. Grover tells Percy that they're in Medusa's lair. They still need to find Annabeth.Annabeth is still being pulled along by the hysterical woman, who realizes she is lost on the Emporium grounds and is terrified they'll never get out alive. Suddenly they stop short, Annabeth saying not to move. Standing right in front of them, a turban-like cloth wrap over her head and dark shades over her eyes, is Medusa (Uma Thurman).Medusa speaks slowly and seductively, telling how she creates her 'statues' which serve as her only company in such a 'lonely' place. Suddenly she addresses Annabeth as 'daughter of Athena,' showing Medusa recognizes her for who she is. Medusa explains that she once had the same beautiful brown hair as Annabeth. Toying with a few locks of Annabeth's hair, Medusa explains that she was desired and courted by many suitors, which made Athena jealous, and led her to curse Medusa.Medusa steps back and removes her headpiece, revealing the snakes that serve as her hair, as Annabeth urges the hysterical woman not to look. Both of them snap their eyes shut as Medusa's tone turns stern, saying that eyes are the windows to the soul, and she hopes they find hers attractive. She removes her dark shades, revealing her terrible blue eyes with the power to turn people to stone. Her tone turning seductive again, she gently whispers for them to 'sneak a peek' at her eyes.The lure proves too much for the hysterical woman, who looks at Medusa's eyes and promptly turns to stone; her now-stone hand still locked around Annabeth's wrist.Percy and Grover arrive, behind Medusa, and she isn't yet aware of their presence. Percy knows that they can look at her reflection safely, and takes out his iPhone. Grover says he'll get Annabeth away.Medusa cockily puts her sunglasses on the hysterical woman's left wrist and gets very close to Annabeth, taunting her that she will eventually open her eyes. Medusa gets close enough that her hair-snakes flick through Annabeth's hair and across her cheeks. Annabeth trembles in fear, desperately fighting to keep her eyes tightly shut.Hearing Medusa speak, Percy calls out, trying to give Annabeth resolve to keep her eyes closed. Medusa hears Percy's voice and whirls around, realizing that the new arrival is another demigod. She heads toward the sound of where Percy's voice came from. Percy runs, leading Medusa away from Annabeth, using the reflection in his iPhone to keep track of Medusa. As Percy pauses behind a statue, Medusa stops, recognizing Percy by the smell of his blood as the son of Poseidon. She remarks that she used to date Poseidon before pushing one statue down, causing it to topple a line of statues like dominoes; the last one landing on Percy.Annabeth struggles futilely to free her wrist from the now-stone woman's grasp, still not daring to open her eyes. Grover comes up and uses a crutch to smash the woman's arm off, freeing Annabeth. The two rush to rendezvous with Percy.Trying to crawl out from under the statue, Percy reaches for his sword, but Medusa kicks it away and lifts Percy by the scruff of his neck. Percy jams his eyes shut as Medusa holds him close to her face and tells him that she hears he has the stolen lightning bolt. She leans her head in close and tells Percy that her 'hungry babies' can open Percy's eyes for him if he doesn't do it himself. She sweetly says that he can stay with her always; all he has to do is look.Medusa's soft and seductive whisper almost has Percy about to open his eyes when Grover and Annabeth arrive on the scene, driving the pickup truck owned by the hysterical woman and her husband (they don't need it anymore). They smash through several statues, knocking Medusa down.Medusa hisses angrily, looking about for Percy. She finds his iPhone and peers curiously at it. Distracted, she doesn't hear Percy coming up behind her. She spots his reflection in the iPhone too late-- Percy beheads her with a swift stroke of his sword.Grover and Annabeth exit the truck, tapping fists in celebration of vanquishing Medusa. Though Grover is repulsed at the idea, Annabeth says they need to take Medusa's severed head with them. If they open her eyes, their power to turn living beings to stone still works. Percy asks Grover for his jacket so they can wrap up the head. Grover gives Percy his hoodie instead.After giving the head to Grover, Percy happens to look again at Medusa's headless body and realizes that she is wearing a bracelet with the pearl set into it. He pries it free and the three of them drive off in the pickup truck.As they head down the road, Annabeth wonders why Luke didn't warn them about Medusa (why indeed....) Grover asks Percy to open up the map so it will show them where the next pearl is. The map reveals the location as a replica of the Greek Parthenon... in Nashville, Tennessee (much to Grover's disgust; he hates country music).It is late at night and they are still on the road. Percy and Annabeth are fast asleep, and Grover starts to nod off at the wheel. The blare of an eighteen-wheeler's horn jolts them all awake and Grover barely swerves away. The three of them, shaken, decide to stop for the night. They make their way to a roadside motor inn and get a room.Just before sunrise, Percy is in the swimming pool, sitting on the pool floor as he loves to do. An image of his mother, and Hades holding her prisoner, flashes through his mind. He looks up and notices Annabeth standing at the poolside, watching him. He surfaces and she sits down, her feet in the water. Percy notices the bruises on Annabeth's wrist from the woman who was turned to stone by Medusa. Gently taking her arm, he heals the bruises for her through his connection to the water. He climbs up and sits beside her at the poolside and asks why Poseidon and Athena are enemies. She explains it started when they vied for patronage of Athens and the people of the city chose Athena. Percy asks what Athena is like, but Annabeth doesn't know-- like Percy and Luke, she's never met her divine parent. Percy is surprised, wondering if any demigod has ever met their divine parent. Annabeth explains that this is forbidden by Zeus himself... he decreed that all gods were prohibited from having any physical contact with their half-mortal children. Both agree that the law is ridiculous, though Annabeth tells Percy that she believes she hears her mother speaking to her in her mind in times of trouble, giving her advice. Percy realizes that's the same as the voice he hears in his head, and Annabeth says that's Poseidon talking to him.An urgent shout from Grover recalls them to their room. A news article on TV has listed Percy as a missing person... and a suspect in the disappearance of Sally. To Percy's revulsion, Gabe Ugliano is interviewed in the news segment, spouting lies about Percy having been on drugs and alcohol; and five nights ago, Percy tried to kill him and threw Sally on the ground, before Percy's 'cripple friend' attacked Gabe from behind (Grover gapes in astonishment at the preposterous story), and Percy kidnapped Sally and took her away. Percy shuts off the TV in disgust, figuring he is now a fugitive.Grover goes to the bathroom to pee and groans as he sees that Percy placed Medusa's head there. He holds it up and admonishes Percy for putting it there. A maid working at the motor inn passes by the window and sees, and screams as she rushes away. Grover curses himself for having left the curtains open. Annabeth realizes they have to leave right away.They arrive in Nashville at daytime. making their way to Centennial Park where the replica of the Parthenon is located. Inside, they stand before a huge statue of a Greek warrior woman. Percy is able to read the Ancient Greek on the nameplate and sees it is a statue of Annabeth's mother, Athena. Annabeth gazes up at the statue, wondering if her mother really looks the way she is depicted, and she smiles when Percy assures her that they'll find out. Grover looks up at a golden headdress set on the statue's head and notes that the pearl is set into the centerpiece of it.This presents a problem-- how to get up 30 feet in the air, especially while the place is filled with tourists. Percy has an idea to the solution. The three of them hide in bathroom stalls, standing on them so their legs and feet aren't seen, and wait for the place to close for the night. An hour after the park closes they come out, with the plan being for Percy to use the flying shoes to get up to the head of the statue. But although the park is closed, the Parthenon isn't quite empty... night custodians are there, cleaning the place. Annabeth loads a hand crossbow and darts between pillars, stealthily and quickly taking the custodians out with drugged darts. Grover drags the sleeping custodians to one side of the Parthenon as Annabeth sets up her wireless laptop and makes a conference call to Luke, to get instructions on activating the flying shoes. Luke quickly explains that Percy needs to get a running start and build up speed, and that it will take some practice. But Percy proves more adept than this, and although he nearly loses his grip on the statue, he is able to climb back up the pry the pearl out from the headdress. Guided by the shoes to an easy landing on the ground, they all tap fists and Annabeth hugs Percy, telling everyone to gather up their things.But they're not out of the woods yet... the custodians have recovered and form a line in front of the exit. Grover tries to bluff them by acting like he's a Park Recreational Services manager. But it quickly becomes apparent that these custodians are not ordinary people. They address Percy by name and demand the return of the lightning bolt. Percy sighs in exasperation, but his protest that he doesn't have it falls on deaf ears. One custodian coughs a puff of fire, and then all five of them merge into a giant monster... the five-headed hydra. Percy, Annabeth and Grover rush behind pillars as the middle head spews a cone of roaring flames. Percy's jacket is ignited, and when he shakes his arm to quell the flames, he loses his grip on the pearl, which flies across the Parthenon, resting on top of a flood drain grille. Activating his sword and shield, Percy takes to the air, and despite Annabeth's urgent warnings, he begins slicing off the heads of the hydra.The hydra collapses as the last head is severed, and Percy and Grover start to high-five. But Annabeth admonishes them that Percy only made the problem worse. She's the only one of the three that remembers that when one head of the hydra is cut off, two more grow back in its place.A terrible roar and the ground shaking prove the point of Annabeth's admonishment as the hydra rises again... now with ten heads; two of which spout flame. Percy tells Annabeth to distract it while he retrieves the pearl. Annabeth draws her bow, loosing several arrows to harass the hydra. But although one head is hit squarely in the eye, the hydra still turns as Percy dashes for the pearl, and the two central heads spew gouts of fire. Percy dives away, using his shield to protect himself, but the shield is thrown from his grasp several yards away. As the hydra closes in, Percy notices emergency fire hoses. Reaching out and concetrating, Percy summons the water from its holding tanks to form a wall between himself and the hydra. The wall of water also acts as a shield against the hydra's flaming breath, and allows Percy to retrieve the pearl. He dashes for the door, Grover and Annabeth right behind him... but they realize the hydra will reach them before they can get the door open. Grover gets an idea and rushes back toward the hydra, grabbing Percy's backpack. He grabs the head of Medusa, and snapping his eyes shut, points the face at the hydra and removes the shades from Medusa's eyes. Quickly the eyes begin to flash and the snake heads begin to thrash about. The flames stop short of the head and the hydra turns to stone.The three adventurers make their way to an all night diner to eat. During the meal, they see a special news bulletin on the TV where scientsts are at a loss to understand a single storm cloud that has grown so massive as to spread over much of Europe and Asia. The cloud is expanding westward toward the United States, and much of the world's coastlines are experiencing gale-force winds and massive surf waves. Annabeth realizes the gods are angry, and they need to get the last pearl quickly. They examine the map and find that it is in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Lotus Hotel and Casino.As they approach the casino, they need to fight to remind themselves that they're only there for the pearl, not for any form of entertainment. Right away a casino employee tries to make them accept a casino fun book, and they have to assert themselves that they aren't checking in. Grover figures that since the cocktail waitresses are all wearing green dresses, perhaps one of them has the pearl.Several waitresses quickly surround them, holding trays filled with cookies that they call Lotus Flowers-- the casino's signature dish. Tentatively, the three of them each try a sample. They find the cookies exquisitely delicious... not even noticing the psychedelic effect the 'lotus flowers' have on them. They start to laugh and giggle in growing excitement as they continue to look around them. In half a minute they've forgotten what they're there for, except to have fun and enjoy themselves. The decision to stay-- perhaps as permanent fixtures of the casino-- is a no-brainer.Percy, Annabeth and Grover all start to partake in the casino's festivities-- gambling, dancing, partying... and of course more of the delicious lotus flowers. But finally, just as Percy is about to eat one, he hears his father's voice admonishing him not to. The flowers dull their senses and keep them prisoner in the casino. Crinkling his brow, he excuses himself from Annabeth to walk around, and leaves the lotus flower uneaten on the bar. He begins to walk through a video arcade, declining all the waitresses who swarm around with their flower trays. Poseidon's voice guides him, telling him to focus. He passes a young man playing a pinball machine themed after the movie, The French Connection. The young man asks if Percy's seen it, and Percy is stunned when the young man doesn't understand him when he says he's seen it on DVD. Quickly he realizes that the young man thinks that the year is still 1971; the year the movie was first released. Percy starts to snap out of it, guided by Poseidon's voice. He realizes the cocktail waitresses are redoubling their efforts to serve him more lotus flowers and starts to understand the entrapment effect of them. Then he walks past a roulette table and sees that the roulette ball is the pearl he came for. This jolts him completely back to his senses. As he walks away from another waitress trying to make him have another lotus flower, a bellhop turns and speaks into a headphone: 'Percy Jackson's awake.'Percy hurries back to Annabeth, finding her dancing with several young women. He grabs her and herds her to where Grover is being tended to by a group of gorgeous young women. Pulling a satyr away from beautiful women is hard enough when Grover is sober, but Percy manages to do it. Raising his voice to an urgent pitch, he finally gets through to them that the lotus flowers are putting them in a trance and making them want to stay and party. The sight of security guards converging on them helps break the trance on Annabeth and Grover. Together with Percy they must now fight their way through the guards back to the roulette table where Percy grabs the pearl. Rushing to a car on display as a prize that can be won, they use it to escape from the casino.Racing down the street until they feel a safe distance away, they recollect their thoughts. Annabeth realizes the casino is the lair of the Lotus Eaters-- and the 'casino' is where they have trapped people since ancient times. Even more dire is Grover passing a large display LCD calendar sign... the date is no longer June 15th, but June 20th... they'd spent five days and nights in the Lotus Casino's trap. The deadline being only a day away, they consult the map, finding the entrance to Hades is in Hollywood. Grover nods grimly, saying he can get them there in four hours.As they pull up before the famous Hollywood hillside sign, the radio gives a news report that the storm clouds have covered most of North America. Several states are ordering evacuations as the weather grows more severe. They run along the sign's letters, pausing as Percy notes that some of the graffiti appears to be written in Ancient Greek. Quickly he reads it: 'Woe to all depraved souls.'Quickly a patch of ground beside the letter opens up, revealing an entryway deep underground... which closes up behind them as they walk in.They make their way down a subterranean tunnel with torches and lots of skulls in the earthen walls. Presently they come to a mysterious man in a long hooded robe, standing in a canoe float in a dark river beside the platform. Approaching him, they see he is the ferryman who brings souls to Hades' kingdom. The ferryman refuses to bring them to Hades because they are still living. He tells them to come back when they are properly dead. Grover tries to bribe the ferryman with several bills of American currency. But, looking at them curiously, the ferryman burns them to ash in his hand, letting the ashes fall through his fingers.Percy realizes Grover was on the right track but used the wrong kind of currency. He gives the ferryman the gold drachmas taken from the fountain in Medusa's lair. This, the ferryman accepts, and takes them across the legendary River Styx, which is filled with centuries of broken human dreams and sorrows; wishes and hopes that never came true.Percy, Grover and Annabeth walk into the entrance to Hades' palace. They are promptly greeted by three hellhounds that guard their master's domain. THe hounds are called off by Persephone (Rosario Dawson) who brings them to Hades. The three adventurers are surprised to see that Hades has taken on human form as well (played by Steve Coogan). Hades reveals he is seeking Zeus' lightning bolt because it would allow him to overthrow his brothers and escape from the underworld, where he was exiled by Zeus. If Zeus and Poseidon destroyed each other in a war, he would be able to take over Olympus.Percy tries to explain that he doesn't have the lightning bolt, but Hades doesn't believe him. He picks up an orb and shatters it on the ground, revealing that this was where he had been keeping Sally imprisoned. Percy rushes forth to hug Sally, grateful that she is alive and well.But slowly everyone starts to become aware of Hades staring intently at Luke's shield, which Percy had dropped to the ground in order to hug his mother. The handgrip of the shield has opened up after being dropped, to reveal a secret compartment inside it. Inside this compartment is the missing lightning bolt.Percy, Grover and Annabeth realize that Luke was behind the theft of the lightning bolt all along, but none of that matters to Hades. He only cares that he has what he wanted. Picking up the bolt, he breaks his word to Percy and orders Persephone to feed Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Sally to 'the souls.'Persephone gestures and a grille over what looks like a fireplace, opens up... but behind this grille is no mere fireplace, but a furnace of damned, burning souls that start to writhe outward, smelling the living souls they are about to receive. Persephone then calls the hellhounds to herd the three adventurers toward the flames. Hades gloats with wicked glee at how he will rule the gods. Persephone grins wickedly and grabs her husband for an amorous smooch.Or not so amorous, as while Hades is distracted, Persephone snatches the lightning bolt out of his hands and zaps him with it, knocking him unconscious. Quickly she calls off the hellhounds and closes the furnace gate. Kneeling over Hades, Persephone gloats at how he will remember nothing of all these recent events when he wakes up. Although grateful, Percy is curious as to why Persephone is helping them. She explains that Hades treats her like dirt, and all she has to look forward to while in his domain, is her alotted time back on Olympus. A war of the gods would destroy all that, and leave her alone with only Hades for company-- the worst kind of company she could dread havinag to keep. She gives Percy the lightning bolt and tells him to take it, and Sally, away.But as Percy takes out the pearls, it quickly becomes evident that there is a problem. There are three pearls, and three members of Percy's party (himself, Grover and Annabeth)... but Sally makes a fourth person, and each pearl only grants egress to one. This means one of them has to stay behind in the underworld. There is a brief argument between Percy and Annabeth, both of whom feel they should be the one to stay... until Grover says that as Percy's protector, it's his duty and job to take on the burden. Persephone is delighted at this and promises to take very good care of Grover.Percy, Annabeth and Sally use the pearls to take them to Olympus, but Percy is confused when they arrive at the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Annabeth points out the terrible storm clouds above-- Zeus and Poseidon preparing for battle. Sally assures Percy that they are in the right place and shows him an entrance to a service closet that contains the secret entrance to Olympus.But Percy is not quite home free yet. There's ten more minutes until the midnight deadline, and Luke has arrived, wearing another pair of his father's flying shoes, to make sure Percy misses that deadline. Questioned by Percy, Luke reveals that when Percy, Grover and Annabeth came to see him about traveling to the underworld, he saw it as the perfect opportunity to dupe Percy into the very role Hermes normally performs... messenger of the gods. Luke hid the lightning bolt in the shield and gave the shield to Percy, so that Percy could unwittingly deliver the bolt to Hades. Reminding Percy that he bears as much animosity toward his divine parent as nearly all the demigods have for theirs, Luke wants to see them go to war and destroy themselves, believing that the demigods could then take over and rule the world as they see fit.Swooping at Percy, Luke knocks him to the ground and seizes the lightning bolt. Drawing a dagger, Annabeth engages him and fends him off, although she cannot defeat Luke while he has the lightning bolt and the flying shoes. Luke takes off into the skies. Percy reaches into his backpack and takes out the flying shoes Luke had given him, and takes off in pursuit.Luke is about to cast lightning at a passing helicopter when Percy dives at him. They wrestle in mid-air until Luke breaks free and tries to blast Percy with lightning. There is a brief cat-and-mouse game through a skyscraper's interior until Percy catches Luke by surprise and wrests the lightning bolt from him. Now it is Luke pursuing Percy, trying to recover it.Percy is almost back at the Empire State Building when Luke hurls a knife that slices the wings off of Percy's flying shoes. No longer able to control his flight, Percy tumbles to a hard landing on a rooftop. Luke picks up the lightning bolt, and questions Percy's heritage as son of Poseidon. Percy sees several water towers atop nearby buildings and concentrates, breaking the tanks open and gathering the water to deluge Luke. Gathering some of the remaining water and shaping it into a trident, Percy says that he must be the son of Poseidon after all. Hurling the trident, he catches Luke across the throat between two of the prongs, taking Luke clear out of his flying shoes and casting him into the river.Donning Luke's shoes, Percy arrives back at the Empire State building with the lightning bolt. Sally and Annabeth flip several switches in a control box in the service closet, which acrivates the hidden secret elevator that takes them all up, far past the roof of the building, into the heavens before the gates of Olympus. Sally, as a mortal, is unable to venture forth onto the divine ground. Annabeth and Percy rush to the hall of the gods.Inside the hall, the deities of the Greek Pantheon are engaged in heated argument until Zeus demands silence and crosses to a time-dial in the center of the great hall. Poseidon and Athena, despite their enmity, both make a final appeal to Zeus to avoid war. But as the time-dial signals the arrival of midnight and the passing of the deadline, Zeus is about to pronounce judgement of war. Just then, Percy and Annabeth rush into the hall bearing the lightning bolt. Zeus demands its return, and Percy does so. The bolt grows to its true size in Zeus' grasp. He says that Percy is wise to betray his father. Percy retorts that he was never working with or for Poseidon's benefit, and he reveals Luke as the true lightning thief (to the great surprise of Hermes (Dylan Neal)), explaining that Luke resented all the gods for not caring about their children, and he wanted them to destroy each other so the demigods could rule Olympus. The gods all look around at each other, seeing how they had been played and pitted against one another. Zeus accepts Percy's explanation and declares peace. Athena (Melina Kanakaredes) smiles at Annabeth and tells her she's very proud of her.Percy mentions that he and Annabeth escaped the Underworld only because Grover stayed behind. Zeus smiles cynically as he realizes that Percy wants him to return Grover to the world of the living. However, he agrees to the request. Zeus declares the convening of the gods to be adjourned. Poseidon makes a plea to his brother that he be allowed to speak to Percy, and Zeus consents-- but just this once.Percy is naturally resentful that Poseidon was never around, and that he never got to even meet him. Poseidon acknowledges that Percy was only seven months when he left him and Sally. He says that being with him and his mother, Sally, made Poseidon start to forget his duties and become more human, which Zeus didn't approve of. Percy is surprised on hearing that Poseidon's siring him was what led Zeus to pass the divine rule prohibiting the gods from having any contact with their children. Poseidon manages to come to terms with Percy, saying he never wanted to leave him or Sally, and was in fact always with him in heart and spirit; Percy acknowledging he heard Poseidon's voice when he spoke to Percy. Poseidon promises that while he might not get to see Percy again, he will always be there with and for him-- in his heart, in his thoughts, and in his dreams. Percy forgives his father and shakes hands with him.Sally brings Percy back to Camp Half Blood, where he can fulfill his destiny as a demigod. Although she will miss him, she says it's where he belongs. She also says, to Percy's great relief, that she is finally kicking Ugliano out of the house, now that he has served his purpose and she doesn't need him anymore.Percy is welcomed by everyone back at the camp, and Grover shows him that he's been promoted to senior protector, and has finally gotten his Satyr horns. Chiron starts to admonish Percy for disobeying his orders and leaving camp without permission, but then says that this is why Percy is now his favorite student-- many times he simply has to follow his own instincts. But hero or not, Percy is, to Chiron, still one of his students, and He sends Percy to suit up for more training.As Grover and Percy walk through the training area, Grover amuses Percy with stories of Grover's time in the underworld as Persephone's paramour. They find Annabeth in the same manner in which Percy first set eyes on her-- she is taking on several other students in swordplay at the same time, holding her own and more. Grover pats Percy's shoulder and tells him that he can handle this on his own now. After defeating the last of her opponents, Annabeth calls for the next one, and Percy steps up to volunteer. Annabeth puts a hand on his neck, welcoming him home and leaning in as if to kiss him. Suddenly with a mischevious look, she surprises Percy by swiping his sword out of its scabbard and pointing her own at him, telling him that he must never be distracted by an opponent. Percy grins and motions for his sword back. She returns it and they square off. The camera slowly pans back as Percy and Annabeth begin their battle, and the credits start to roll.Midway through the credits is an extra scene showing Sally telling Gabe to take all his things with him. He goes to the kitchen in disgust for a beer and finds the refrigerator locked, with a note from Percy on the door, warning that the refrigerator door must never be opened again. Annoyed, Gabe smashes the lock off and opens the door... and finds the severed head of Medusa inside. Fade to black as the snake heads lunge out, and the credits resume.

title: Dragonslayer
synopsis: Dragonslayer opens with a small group of villagers journeying to a lonely tower in a place called Cragganmore. This tower is home to a powerful and kindly old sorcerer named Ulrich (Sir Ralph Richardson). Ulrich's manservant, Hodge (Sydney Bromley) answers the knock and turns them away. He tells them he knows that the villagers have travelled far and are on urgent business but Ulrich will still not see them. One of the villagers asks the leader of the group, a young man named Valerian (Caitlin Clarke) what they will do now. From the villager, it is implied that Valerian is the one who was certain that they could turn to Ulrich for help with their problems and organized the small group to come to the tower.Valerian boldly steps forward and shouts out to Ulrich that he and his group will not leave the doorstep of the tower until they are heard. Glancing to his right, Valerian spots Ulrich's apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol) looking back at the group through a window. Galen goes to his master, who is in a magical trance, and rouses him from it, telling him they have visitors. Ulrich responds that he knows they are there, and that the business they have come on is truly dire. He then shares a bit of disturbing news with Galen: Ulrich has foreseen his own death.Valerian and his group are brought into the tower while Ulrich and Galen prepare to greet them. Ulrich and Galen talk as they attire themselves appropriately. Ulrich says his outfit is the same as that worn by his own master before he died, and he had once changed lead into gold, a feat Ulrich could never duplicate -- Galen would stand to inherit a fortune. Galen is disturbed by Ulrich's prattling, because he doesn't want to see his master die. But Ulrich says he welcomes it. His life as a sorcerer, he feels, has accomplished little. He asks Galen how his studies are going and if he truly still wishes to be a sorcerer. Galen says he wishes it more than anything.Ulrich and Galen appear before the villagers with a lot of pomp and circumstance that leaves them a little non-plussed. Ulrich asks Valerian to identify himself. Stepping forward, Valerian starts to explain why they are here, and Ulrich says he already knows that the group has traveled from Urland to see him. Ulrich sits at a stone table and asks to see the artifacts.Valerian slides a pack to Ulrich, who pulls out a couple of scales. He asks Valerian how he came by them, and Valerian says he found them at the foot of 'the lair.' Ulrich asks what else Valerian brought, and the young man pulls out what he says is a claw-- this 'claw' being nearly as long as Valerian's forearm from elbow to wrist. Ulrich stares in surprise and says that the object is no claw, but a tooth. He asks if the villagers truly expect him to do battle with the creature the villagers fear-- a dragon. Valerian listens to the short list of wizards and sorcerers that Ulrich suggests and flatly responds that they are all dead. Ulrich is the only one left.Valerian goes on to state that twice each year, at the spring and autumn equinoxes, the king of Urland selects a new 'victim--' a young maiden at the cusp of young adulthood, still virgin, and offers her to the dragon as a sacrifice. Ulrich knows that the selection is done by lottery, calling it barbaric. He muses how the dragon leaves the villages of the kingdom live in peace in return for these sacrifices, and says the king has made a pact with a monster.In response to Valerian's challenging question on whether he fears dragons, Ulrich says that it is because of sorcerers that dragons exist. The skies used to be dotted with them, and they were noble, majestic creatures. He knows the dragon to whom the scales belong-- it is called Vermithrax. Looking over the scales closely, he explains why Vermithrax forces Urland to sacrifice virgins to it in return for not destroying them-- Vermithrax has reached a venerable old age, older than many dragons normally live to, and has grown feeble and decrepit. It lives a life of constant pain, which has made it spiteful and vengeful toward anything that lives.Ulrich has donned a traveling pack and taken up his staff, to journey with Valerian and his fellow villagers back to Urland. But an unpleasant surprise is waiting for them outside the tower-- Tyrian, captain of the royal guard (John Hallam). Valerian is immediately confrontational with Tyrian, who says he doesn't question Valerian traveling, even far from Urland-- his concern is the visit to a sorcerer. He knows that Valerian has come here to ask for Ulrich's aid in slaying Vermithrax. Tyrian claims to have no love for Vermithrax, but before he consents to an attempt to slay the dragon, he wants assurances that Valerian has found a suitable challenger. He gives a long diatribe about how and why sorcerers don't prove their true power in front of a doubter.Ulrich determines to silence all argument. He doffs his amulet and orders Galen to return it to the conjuring room, and then bring out a dagger that is there. He then tells Tyrian that he will have his test. Galen tosses the dagger out of the conjuring room's window, where Ulrich hands it to Tyrian. who satisfies himself that the dagger is sharp. Giving a brief incantation, Ulrich opens his tunic and puts the point of the dagger to his chest, where his heart is. He is offering Tyrian to test him by stabbing him through the heart with the dagger. Seeing this, Galen starts to rush out of the tower, but all the doors and windows quickly shut, trapping him inside. Outside, Ulrich assures Tyrian that he cannot hurt him. Tyrian stares at Ulrich for a moment, then takes hold of the sorcerer's shoulder to brace himself, and thrusts the dagger home.Everyone stares for a minute as Ulrich simply looks up at the window from which Galen tossed out the dagger. Then, slowly, without a word, he falls to his knees and then to the ground, dead. Disgusted but also smug, Tyrian signals to his soldiers, who leave the tower wordlessly. Inside the tower, Galen slumps in grief, seeing his master slain. He is oblivious to the tower windows and doors all re-opening.The Urland villagers watch as Galen tends to his master's funeral, properly attiring the body and burning it on a pyre. The villagers look at the fire for a moment, seeing that it burns green. Then, as one, they turn and start to hasten on their way.Hodge gathers the ashes into a pouch, showing he has quickly lost all faith in Ulrich having ever been a true sorcerer. Galen goes through his chores in the conjuring room, still in shock over his master's death. He finds Ulrich's amulet on the table beside him, which is baffling to the young apprentice because he put it in a small chest. He opens the chest, finding it empty, and puts the amulet back inside, placing a rock over the lid. Resuming his chores, he finds the amulet suddenly in front of him again.Galen and Hodge are walking through the countryside, Hodge rambling a series of complaints about his treatment over his long years of service. Galen uses a few magic feats to silence him. He tells Hodge he had plenty of respect for his master, but he is the one who is master now.The Urland villagers are camping for the night while en route back home. Greil (Albert Salmi) is very bitter at all that has transpired, tearing into Valerian for having led them to Cragganmore. Valerian, on the other hand, does not defend himself; he feels Greil is right. He led Greil and the other villagers to Ulrich for nothing.Suddenly the villagers react to some disturbance, though they cannot identify it just yet. A flash issues from the campfire, and Galen and Hodge are there. Galen boldly tells the Urland villagers that he will fulfill the task they came to Ulrich for; as the inheritor of Ulrich's craft and knowledge, he will serve their needs as the sorcerer they sought.The need of the Urland villagers is then shown as group of royal guard are bringing Vermithrax another sacrifice (Yolande Palfrey). She is dressed in a white gown with a garland of white flowers around her head, and she is chained with heavy steel manacles. The horse pulling the cart carrying the woman stops and fusses incessantly, refusing to proceed further. Soldiers place a hood over the terrified young woman's head and half-pull, half-drag her to a tall ceremonial stake driven into the ground. A ring in her shackles is placed through a hook at the top of the stake, so her arms are raised above her head, as the king's minister recites a proclamation about her sacrifice being for the greater good of Urland, and her father will be recompensed for the loss of his daughter by being exempt from royal taxes for five years. Midway through the diatribe, the ground begins to shake, prompting everyone to flee, leaving the frightened sacrifice to her fate-- and leaving the hapless horse that drew the cart she was transported in, as well.The young woman manages to pull the hood off of her head as the soldiers, servants and minister clear away from Vermithrax's lair. Struggling in desperate terror against her manacles, she manages to wrench one wrist free, nearly shattering it in the process. But it is too late-- one massive claw emerges from the entrance to the lair. Then the dragon's massive head. Thrashing and pulling wildly, the young lady finally wrenches her other wrist through the manacle, crushing her wrist and hand, and turns to flee from the dragon. But even in its old age and decrepit state, Vermithrax can cover far more ground with each step than the sacrificial victim. Overtaking her easily, the ancient dragon arrests her flight with its tail. The petrified girl can only huddle against the lair wall and scream in anguish as Vermithrax incinerates her with a blast of its fiery breath.Valerian awakes abruptly at daybreak and quietly steps away from the camp. Galen awakes a short bit later and wanders over to a nearby lake to bathe. He finds Valerian there, ordering Galen away urgently. Valerian is very insistent on not sharing the lake with Galen, or being seen while bathing. Galen dives into the water and is swimming toward Valerian underwater. Drawing close, Galen finds out why Valerian was so intent on driving Galen away. He shoots up to the surface, choking on water at the shock of what he'd seen-- Valerian is in fact a young woman, not a man. Still overtaken by the shock, neither of them notices Tyrian lurking nearby. Tyrian does not notice the secret Valerian has been hiding, but he notices Galen there, and he isn't pleased. He orders a retainer to fetch him his bow.Galen and Valerian are dressing, and Galen is trying to promise he will tell nobody what he's seen. Valerian only blames her own carelessness. She mentions that nobody has ever known the truth about her, except only her father, since the day she was born. Galen realizes she's referring to the lottery-- daughters are chosen, but sons are not. Valerian then remarks that noble families, paying enough in bribes, are never entered into the lottery-- to say nothing of the king's own daughter, Princess Elspeth (Chloe Salaman). Valerian's father, on the other hand, is a simple blacksmith, and poor... as are many of the fathers of eligible young women.As Valerian leaves the lake, Galen notices a small flock of birds startled by something. Looking around, he gazes into the lake's reflective surface, and sees a vision of Tyrian approaching on horseback with soldiers, and Tyrian drawing his bow in ambush. Galen rushes back toward camp, frantically calling to Hodge... but it is too late; Hodge has been shot through the chest with an arrow and is mortally wounded. As he dies, he cryptically tells Galen to take the pouch with Ulrich's ashes, find a lake of burning water, and throw the ashes in. Galen tries to use his amulet to save Hodge, but fails.Galen and party sail in a small boat back to Urland. As they disembark on the Urland shore, Tyrian and his men are still following from a distance and watching. The party continues along a trail on foot, Valerian impatiently trying to get Galen to keep moving. But when she mentions they are near Vermithrax's lair, Galen stops and moves off the trail, saying (over Valerian's protest that they are safe if they keep moving) that he wants to see the lair. Valerian and Greil must reluctantly gather the rest of the villagers and follow.Poking around the lair's entrance, Galen finds the chains that had been used to bind the sacrificed maiden, and dripping water around the entrance that becomes steam as it hits the floor. He inquires if there are other entrances, and is told there are none. Valerian and Greil angrily try to convince Galen to leave Vermithrax alone, but Galen pays no attention, starting to venture into the cavern. He picks up another shed scale and then hears a brief rumble. A gout of smoke from deeper in the cave satisfies Galen that Vermithrax is in the lair. Emerging quickly, Galen drops his cloak to the ground and pulls his amulet out from under his shirt. Holding it up, he recites an arcane chant. At first, nothing appears to happen, but Galen continues to concentrate and his amulet begins to glow. Slowly at first, several rocks begin to fall from the top of the cliff face. A full scale rockslide is triggered, burying the entrance in tons of rock and rubble. Everyone is forced to leap for cover as the rockslide collapses the cliffside, further sealing off the entrance to the lair. As they all emerge, Valerian excitedly shouts that Galen has done it-- he's saved Urland.Back at the village, a celebration is underway regaling its hero. Galen performs some slight-of-hand tricks to amuse the village children. Dragon effigies are burned, musicians play, and the villagers dance and make merry... all except one.In the attic of her home, Valerian is holding up a mirror in front of herself... and holding a dress against the front of her body. As she turns the mirror for a better view, her father notices and hurries to get her to put the dress away back in the trunks in the attic, warning that she might be seen.Being seen is exactly what Valerian now wants. Tired of continuing the masquerade, Valerian dons the dress, with a headdress and sandals, and boldly steps outside into the village as her true self. The celebration stops, everyone turning and staring as some of the children start to gather around Valerian, trying to touch her arms as if not quite sure that what they are seeing is real.Galen quickly comes up to Valerian and takes her hand. He calls out to the musicians, who begin to play again. Galen takes Valerian's hand and leads her into a dance. Slowly a few of the villagers start to join, and then more, and finally the celebration resumes in full swing. Greil, drinking with a friend, is thoughtful; wishing he'd been as clever as Valerian's father. Greil is also wondering how it is that a priest came to the village at the very moment of Galen's triumph.The village's celebration is cut short at the arrival of Tyrian and several soldiers. Tyrian announces that King Casiodorus (Peter Eyre) wishes to meet Galen in person. Galen is deeply suspicious as to the nature of the 'gratitude' that Galen says the king wishes to show, but Tyrian (a bit sternly) says that if he'd been sent to kill Galen he'd have done it already-- the king wishes merely to meet Galen and speak to him.Galen is brought before the king and his court in the royal castle, to give a demonstration of his skill in sorcery. King Casiodorus is neither amused nor impressed at the paltry display of tricks, and finally starts to explain to Galen about his brother, King Gazerick. Gazerick assembled a whole army and rode out to do battle with Vermithrax, but the dragon slaughtered the entire army and then went on a rampage across the countryside, incinerating whole fields and villages. Death and famine followed in the dragon's wake until Casiodorus instituted the lottery and began offering the sacrifice of young maidens. Vermithrax became appeased and ceased its attacks on the villages.Casiodorus notices the bulge under Galen's shirt and pulls the amulet away, angrily confronting Galen for toying with such a dangerous beast. He justifies the lottery and the sacrifices by pointing to the hundreds of lives that are saved in the process. But Galen, adhering to his master's beliefs, tells the king that he cannot make a shameful peace with a monster like Vermithrax, which, as Galen insists, is now dead. Casiodorus merely says, 'we shall see' before ordering that Galen be imprisoned in the royal dungeons.At the dragon's lair, rocks and stones all about the destroyed cliff face begin to smoke and smolder.Galen draws a small pentagram in chalk on the floor of his dungeon cell and tries to use his magic to escape, but fails. Suddenly he hears a voice behind him; translating his words-- it is Princess Elspeth, who, as she tells Galen, is schooled in both Latin (the language Galen spoke in) and Greek. Elspeth begs Galen not to view her father and royal court as the same kind of monsters as Vermithrax. She insists that despite the loss of life and seeming cruelty of the lottery, her father, as king, must protect his people. But Galen counters by pointing out that Casiodorus is also protecting Elspeth. He confronts her with his knowledge that the wealthy noble families pay bribes so that their daughters are exempt from the lottery. He is surprised to find that Elspeth truly knows nothing of her father's plans -- her protests to the contrary sound very genuine. Elspeth excuses herself as the countryside begins to experience tremors.Elspeth goes to confront her father on what she's learned. She had thought that her name had been included in every lottery since she came of age. Casiodorus, busy trying to study Galen's amulet and trying to turn lead into gold, pays only minimal attention to his daughter and his attempts to assure her that she had been in every lottery the same as all other young women in the village, are all in vain-- Elspeth sees through him immediately and confronts him for lying to her. Angry at Elspeth, Casiodorus snaps his head up to confront her... but the whole kingdom is struck by an earthquake that tells everyone that all is anything but well.Elspeth goes back to the dungeon and opens up the cell so Galen can escape. Tyrian promptly spots Galen and organizes his men to try and stop him. Galen acquires a horse and escapes through a wall that collapses in front of him. He passes by Casiodorus, who calls him a fool-- the earthquake can only mean one thing... Vermithrax is still alive... and very angry.The priest, Brother Jacobus (Ian McDiarmid) leads the Urland villagers to the buried lair and tries to lead them in prayer, asking God to throw Lucifer back down into the depths of Hell, but the prayer is useless -- fire erupts from the ground as Vermithrax emerges. Everyone flees except Brother Jacobus, and Greil, who hides behind a rock and watches Vermithrax emerge through a fissure in the ground. Brother Jacobus brazenly confronts Vermithrax, who is completely unimpressed with the priest, proving so with a blast of fiery breath that burns the man to death.Vermithrax then flies out to punish the village and its people. Galen sees the village being set ablaze as Vermithrax unleashes its wrath before flying off again.Morning comes, and Tyrian and his men ride into the village. Knowing that Galen was brought to the village by Valerian, they storm her home, looking to see if Galen is being sheltered there. Tyrian tells Valerian's father that since his 'son' has proven to be a daughter, she will now be entered in the next lottery, which the king has called for immediately in an attempt to appease Vermithrax. Valerian, however, is unafraid. Feeling guilty at all the maidens who died while she lived, she is determined to face the jeopardy and risk with all the other eligible maidens.The soldiers do not find Galen anywhere in the blacksmith's home, and leave. The one place they didn't check is a secret alcove underneath (and concealed by) the blacksmith's anvil. Valerian and her father tilt the anvil with iron rods to let Galen out, and he asks Valerian's father if he has ever forged a great weapon.The blacksmith has indeed forged a mighty weapon... one he has kept hidden away at the bottom of a waterfall. He goes to retrieve it and finish perfecting its edge so Galen can try to slay Vermithrax properly this time. The weapon is a huge, masterfully crafted spear that the blacksmith has named Dragonslayer. He shows that the weapon's blade is capable of shaving metal off of a horseshoe. Valerian, however, is still not satisfied. Vermithrax is far more than mere flesh and blood, and nobody has ever wounded it before. Galen says that she is right. He needs the amulet.Nighttime comes, and all the villagers gather at the castle for the lottery. Valerian is taken and placed in a roped-off section where all the nervous young women wait to see which of them will be chosen to die. The lots are all placed into a massive iron cauldron and stirred with a long rod. The king's minister, Horsrik (Roger Kemp), pulls a lot and recites the royal proclamation as precursor to identifying the chosen sacrifice.However as Horsrik prepares to read the name, he suddenly freezes and falls silent. The villagers impatiently chant for him to read the name on the lot. Casiodorus calls for silence and tells Horsrik to read the name. Swallowing nervously, Horsrik announces that the chosen sacrifice is... Princess Elspeth, the king's daughter.King Casiodorus leaps to his feet, taking the lot from Horsrik, stammering in a completely unconvincing tone that Horsrik misspoke; the name on the lot is in fact illegible and he will personally draw a new lot. The whole of the villagers, following Valerian, all protest that no mistake was made and the name should stand.Ignoring the outraged cries from Valerian and the other villagers, Casiodorus draws another tile, staring at it in shock. At that moment the most unlikely of saviors steps forward... Elspeth herself. Taking the tile from her father's hand, she raises a hand to quiet the villagers and says that there is no mistake; the name on the tile is her own.Now desperate, Casiodorus rummages through the cauldron. All of the tiles bear only his daughter's name and none others. Outraged, he declares the whole lottery invalid... but Elspeth demurs. She declares to the whole of the kingdom that she has replaced the names of all the maidens in the kingdom with her own, but this does not make the lottery invalid, but valid; she has learned that her father has secretly excluded her from participation in the lottery. Her heart aching for all the young girls who died while she lived on, she is seeking to atone by stepping forth and laying her own life down as the next sacrifice. Everyone is still and silent as they look up at the Princess. Some are sympathetic, some are sad, but all admire and respect the bold sacrifice she has chosen to make.Back inside the castle, Casiodorus makes a desperate appeal to Tyrian, saying that if not for him, to do something for the good of the kingdom. But Tyrian says simply that loyalty to the kingdom is his first duty, and that is not the solution to his king's troubles... but the crux of it.Having snuck into the castle during the lottery, Galen searches for his amulet. His search proves fruitless-- and costly, as Tyrian and his men suddenly swarm into the throne room and surround him. Casiodorus orders them to stand down. Over the protests of Tyrian and Horsrik, the king speaks to Galen not as ruler of Urland, not as heartless executor of the lottery... but as the loving father of a young daughter who is about to die. There was one element to the lottery that Casiodorus desperately hoped would work to the favor of the whole of the kingdom... time. He knew that Vermithrax was an extremely old dragon. The lotteries and sacrifices were meant to wait it out until Vermithrax finally died from old age, whereupon the lotteries could be stopped and no more maidens had to die. But now the king has run out of time; his own daughter is the next sacrifice. He has placed Galen's amulet around his own neck. Removing it, he returns it to Galen and begs him to save Elspeth.Galen is with Valerian and her father, preparing for battle. The blacksmith muses about Elspeth's being the next sacrifice, clearly in admiration of her. He is stoking the fire in his forge to temper Dragonslayer. But Galen says the forge fires will not suffice. He draws out his amulet and recites an incantation that heats the blade of the spear until it glows brilliantly with heat. As the spear's blade is rested on the anvil and the blacksmith begins working on it with his hammer, neither he nor Galen see Valerian discretely taking up a basket and quietly leaving the workshop. She goes to Vermithrax's lair and begins gathering more shed scales. She starts to venture into the outer mouth of the lair itself... and as she bends to take another scale, something lunges out of the shadows at her.The blacksmith has finished tempering the spear, and Galen finds it can shear off the anvil's solid steel horn. He and Galen have noticed by now that Valerian is gone, and they think she simply didn't want to be there when Galen left for what was likely the last time. The blacksmith gives him an emotional farewell, offering to say goodbye on his behalf, to Valerian.Galen takes up Dragonslayer and goes to Vermithrax's lair. He is met there by Valerian, who has sewn the dragon scales she collected together into a shield, which she hopes might offer protection from the dragon's terrible fiery breath. Valerian's farewell to Galen is far colder than the one her father gave. She believes that Galen is going to be ripped apart by Vermithrax and she'll never see him again, and he'll have accomplished nothing. She also has found out that Vermithrax is not alone in the lair... it is raising and nursing a small brood of baby dragons, which Galen knows will also have to be killed.Valerian asks Galen, bluntly, if he is in love, and he says he is. Valerian responds that she understands and doesn't care-- she, too, admires Elspeth's bravery and acknowledges her striking beauty. Moreover, she believes that Galen will by dead by the end of the night, and Valerian herself might be dead soon after-- Vermithrax will go on another rampage, more lotteries will be held, and she has abandoned her masquerade of living as a young man... and as a virgin she is eligible for the lotteries. Galen sits down beside her and tells her that she is mistaken about one thing... he is in love, but not with Elspeth. He leans in toward Valerian and begins to kiss her.Night falls. The sacrificial stake is being hammered back into place as the wagon arrives with Elspeth, adorned in the sacrificial white gown and garland of flowers; her wrists in heavy steel manacles. She shakes her head no as Horsrik approaches with the black hood; she wishes to look the beast in the face. The ring in her chains is placed on the stake's hook as Horsrik begins to read the proclamation of sacrifice. He barely gets past the opening of it when the parchment flares blue and begins to burn, forcing him to drop it. This was no dragon fire, but magical fire... conjured by Galen. A cloud of smoke flares in front of Elspeth, and Galen is standing in front of her, spear and shield at the ready. Horsrik and the royal retinue all flee at Galen's presence.All except one... Tyrian. His first loyalty is to the kingdom of Urland, and he still believes in the necessity of the lottery. He is ready to defend Elspeth's sacrifice with his very life; Galen must kill him if he wishes to save her. But Galen says he doesn't need the sacrifice to want to kill Tyrian-- he has plenty of reasons for killing him that have nothing to do with Elspeth or the dragon. Casting aside his shield, he readies his spear, as Tyrian draws his sword. Elspeth shouts in vain for Galen to withdraw. She also believes that her sacrifice is necessary for the good of the kingdom. She proves this in no uncertain terms when Galen suddenly disengages from Tyrian and swings his massive spear toward her manacles, slicing through the chains, and ordering her to run. But Elspeth, taking advantage of the battle, turns and bravely marches straight into Vermithrax's lair. The princess is heard uttering a brief scream that is quickly silenced, and Tyrian, leaning against the sacrificial stake, mocks Galen for his failure. His scorn comes at the expense of Tyrian's own life, as Galen suddenly thrusts Dragonslayer forward, smashing clean through the thick wooden stake and impaling Tyrian.Taking up the shield again, and a torch, Galen ventures into the lair. He doesn't get very far when he finds, to his dismay, the terrible fate of Princess Elspeth. He finds one of her slippers in the outer mouth of the lair. Further in, Elspeth lies dead on the ground; Vermithrax's young chewing on her body. Although nauseated, he kills them all before venturing forward.Deep inside the lair, Galen finds a huge underground lake; fire burning all around as if the very water itself was burning. As he jumps across a path of stones jutting from the lake, the water behind him begins to bubble. Looking down, he catches a reflection in the water's surface and whirls to find himself face to face with Vermithrax. Rising up to a size that towers well above Galen, the ancient dragon spreads its wings and draws its head back. Galen ducks down and huddles behind his shield as Vermithrax releases its blast of fiery breath at the young sorcerer. The shield sizzles and smokes but protects Galen from harm.Looking to get into a better position, Galen leads Vermithrax on a chase through the lair. Vermithrax tries more than once to destroy the trespasser with its fiery breath, but the shield fashioned of its own shed scales continues to protect Galen. But Galen makes a bad mistake when he rushes past Elspeth's body with Vermithrax still in pursuit. The dragon pauses, turns, and notices its young, freshly killed by Galen. The dragon is enraged and rushes in pursuit of the one who slaughtered its offspring.Vermithrax finds Galen's shield propped up against a rock face. Thinking Galen is hiding behind it, the dragon moves forward for the kill. But Galen has set a trap-- he is standing on a ledge well above the tunnel that Vermithrax is emerging from. As Vermithrax's head and long neck begin to poke into the cave, Galen leaps right onto the back of Vermithrax's neck and plunges the spear deep into its hide. He stabs Vermithrax repeatedly as the massive beast thrashes about wildly. It manages to pitch Galen off and down to the floor, and snakes its massive head out to bite him in half. But Galen is ready with Dragonslayer, and drives the massive spear blade into Vermithrax's throat. Vermithrax bellows in agony as it pitches and flails about. The dragon's thrashing breaks the steel head of the spear off of the wooden shaft, leaving the blade still firmly lodged in its neck. Galen snatches up his shield, backing out toward the mouth of the lair as Vermithrax looses another massive blast of fire at him.Valerian is sitting outside the lair when she feels the ground shake. Going to investigate, she finds the shield and the broken shaft of the spear. A short distance away is Galen; bloodied, eyes closed, unconscious... but to her profound relief, he opens his eyes slowly and tells her that he's still alive, but Vermithrax is as well.Valerian brings Galen back to her home and nurses his wounds. Growing emotional, she begs Galen to leave Urland with her. If he truly loves her, as he says he did, their best hope to be happy together is to give up their current lives and travel to another kingdom to begin over again. Valerian's father agrees with her, telling Galen that magic and sorcery are dying out, which will naturally bring about the end of dragonkind, and he is happy with it. Galen and Valerian cannot hope for any kind of good life in Urland.As the two begin to set out, Valerian's father gives her a final gift: A small metal crucifix on a leather thong for her to wear around her neck. She hugs him gratefully as she and Galen set off. Greil, having joined the priesthood after the death of Brother Jacobus, rings a bell calling all the villagers to prayer, and the blacksmith turns and goes to pray with the other villagers.Galen and Valerian are getting on a small rowboat with the few belongings they've brought with them. Galen suddenly pauses, looking up at the sky. Valerian follows his gaze to a curious sight she doesn't understand; the planets are coming into a rare alignment, and the moon is approaching the sun for a solar eclipse. Looking down suddenly, Galen sees the reflection of the sun on the water; as if the huge lake was burning. Suddenly he begins to understand. The burning water and lake of fire, as Hodge had said before he died, was all part of Ulrich's plan. He races back toward Vermithrax's lair, Valerian running behind him, completely bewildered and frightened.As they run, back in the village, Greil, leading the people in prayer, asks the village to come together and appeal to God to strike down Vermithrax.As Galen arrives at the dragon's lair, Valerian leaps suddenly, grabbing at his legs and tackling him to the ground, to try and stop him from killing himself. Galen finally explains that Ulrich, old and growing physically weak, couldn't make the journey to the lair on foot... so he had them make the journey for him.Inside the lair, Galen lights a torch. Valerian insists on coming along with him, although the sight of Elspeth's body, partially eaten by Vermithrax's young, shakes her courage. Galen makes his way to the lake of fire where he first encountered Vermithrax, and opens the pouch containing his master's ashes, scattering them into the burning water with an arcane incantation. The fire all throughout the cavern chamber goes out, and Galen's amulet begins to glow. A small patch of green flame rises from the water and begins to move slowly toward Galen. The flame begins to spin around in a small vortex that coalesces into a shape. Ulrich appears inside the flame and approaches Galen.Overcome with relief at being reunited with his master, Galen sadly tells Ulrich that he believes he's failed. He feels he hadn't been strong, as Ulrich said he would be... but Ulrich disagrees, saying he'll be stronger yet. But for now, they have much to do.As if to lend emphasis to Ulrich's words, Greil, back in the village, begins baptizing the villagers as Christians. Two young children peek outside and find Vermithrax flying through the air, readying itself for battle.Valerian finds her way out of the cave and spots Vermithrax perched on a high outcropping of rock. The dragon sniffs the air as Ulrich and Galen start to emerge. Vermithrax knows that it must fight for its life. It catches sight of Ulrich from afar and the two stare at each other briefly before Vermithrax takes wing again.Valerian finds her way back to Galen, finding Ulrich returned. He looks at her knowingly, recognizing her for who she was when she first came to see him, as he fingers the crucifix she now wears. Ulrich tells Galen that he has one more dire task ahead of him. He must destroy the amulet... and Ulrich along with it. Galen brought Ulrich back from out of the flame, and he must also send Ulrich back. Ulrich tells Galen that he will know the right moment, and must act while Ulrich still lives. The solar eclipse darkens the skies as Ulrich teleports up to the top of a mountain to face Vermithrax.Standing high on the mountaintop, Ulrich raps the ground with his staff, summoning a storm. Massive dark clouds cover the already dark sky as lightning and wind begin to rage. Galen and Valerian climb partway up the mountain and find a small alcove for shelter. They see Ulrich gesture, and the winds suddenly begin to calm as Galen's amulet begins to pulse. Vermithrax appears in the sky, at first so distant he appears as a mere speck among the clouds. Ominously he swoops down and begins to soar around the peak where Ulrich awaits.As Vermithrax swoops past Ulrich, the sorcerer barely ducking out of reach of its terrible talons, Valerian picks up a rock and puts it on the mountain face, telling Galen to smash the amulet as Ulrich told him. But Galen says that Ulrich also told him he'd know the right time... and he knows this isn't it.Vermithrax loops around for another dive at Ulrich, who points his staff and gestures, causing lightning to streak out of the clouds and smite the ancient dragon. Vermithrax is briefly knocked from the sky, falling ponderously, before recovering and regaining flight. It dives and rakes Ulrich with a claw, knocking the sorcerer to the ground; his shoulder bloodied. Ulrich struggles to his feet, looking at his wound, when suddenly Vermithrax is hovering in the air behind and above him. The dragon blasts Ulrich with a gout of fiery breath. Ulrich barks an incantation, and is unharmed by the flame, but his staff is burning, and Ulrich casts it aside.Valerian, seeing this, grabs the amulet from around Galen's neck and puts it on the rock she's prepared. She picks up another large stone and raises it above her head to smash the amulet. Galen grabs her arms and they struggle briefly over the rock; Galen urgently telling Valerian, 'Not yet.'Vermithrax climbs high into the skies, above the heavy tempest clouds, obscuring him from view. Ulrich waits on the mountaintop for it to strike again. Finally Vermithrax turns and dives, air rushing past its massive wings like a gale. Ulrich faces the beast down, spreading his arms wide-- just as Vermithrax seizes the aged sorcerer in its claw and soars back up toward the clouds with him.Pulling the rock away from Valerian, Galen goes to the amulet. He lifts the rock, hesitating briefly as he looks on it. Ulrich, still grasped in Vermithrax's claw, calls out to him. Taking a breath, Galen smashes the rock down on the amulet, destroying it.Ulrich's body detonates in a massive explosion that destroys Vermithrax in mid-air. Galen and Valerian watch as the dragon's body plunges from the sky, deep into a great lake. The force of impact and the heat from the dragon's still-smoldering corpse leaves a massive crater that displaces the water from the lake basin. Slowly the cloud cover breaks and the eclipse passes, brightening the skies once again.As Galen and Valerian make their way back down the mountain, they find Greil leading the villagers to the site of Vermithrax's body. Greil takes the dragon's death as a sign of deliverance by God. As the priest leads the villagers in prayers of thanks, a royal coach arrives bearing King Casiodorus. Taking up a broadsword, Casiodorus goes to Vermithrax's body and drives the blade of the sword into the remains of the great beast's head as Horsrik calls out for all to hail Casiodorus Rex, Dragon Slayer. With the king taking credit for the death of Vermithrax, and the people of Urland turning to God and embracing Christianity, the age of magic-- and dragons-- has come to an end.Galen and Valerian have resumed their journey out of Urland, to find a new life together. Galen has resigned himself to his new life as an ex-sorcerer and common man. Valerian knows he will miss Ulrich; not just as his master, but as a great friend and father figure. But unlike Galen, Valerian is very glad that the amulet is destroyed and gone. She tells Galen that he may not be a sorcerer anymore, but it matters nothing to her, as long as she has him. Galen takes comfort in her love for him... but then wishes that the two of them just had a horse.No sooner does Galen voice this wish when a beautiful white horse trots into view behind them over the edge of the hill. Valerian turns and stares, completely dumbfounded, as Galen can only give a huge, goofy grin. Dragonslayer comes to a close, the credits beginning to play as Galen and Valerian ride on the horse's back, continuing on their journey.

title: Jawbreaker
synopsis: In the opening scene, we are introduced to four high school girls whom are blessed with beauty and charisma. They are known as the Flawless Four who are the most popular girls in Reagan High School in southern California. The clique consists of Courtney Shayne (Rose McGowan) known as Satan-in-heels; Marcie Fox (Julie Benz) known as 'Foxy'; Julie Freeman (Rebecca Gayheart); and Elizabeth Purr (Charlotte Ayanna), known as the Princess Di of Reagan High. Of the four, Elizabeth Purr was the only one who was genuinely kind-hearted and loved by the entire school. Julie was doomed to be popular because of 'that face' and because she was best friends with Elizabeth Purr. Cold-blooded queen bee Courtney and her airheaded friend, Marcie, demand respect through terror.However, Courtney, Marcie and Julie play a mindless prank on Liz the morning of her seventeenth birthday, by performing a fake kidnapping: They surprise Liz in bed, bind her with ropes (with Courtney ramming a jawbreaker candyball into her mouth to gag her) and cover it with duct tape. The girls trap Liz, dressed only in a shirt and panties, in the trunk of a car, as she struggles and squeals through her gag, and drive off. They plan to take the bound, gagged, and helpless girl to a restaurant and stuff her face with pancakes. However, upon opening the trunk, they are greeted with the grisly sight of Liz dead, having choked to death by aspirating the jawbreaker into her larynx.Horrified, Julie wants to go to the police but Courtney forbids her. Instead, Courtney calls the school pretending to be Liz's mother and tells them Liz is ill and cannot attend school. To keep up appearances, Courtney, Marcie and Julie then go to school as though nothing had happened. When the principal sends school outcast Fern Mayo (Judy Greer) to deliver Liz's homework at the end of the day, she stumbles upon the three girls and Liz's mangled and decomposing body. Out of jealousy, Courtney fabricates a story that Liz died at the hands of a rapist, and plots to tarnish Liz's good reputation by spreading false rumors that she was actually a rebellious, promiscuous girl, and not the perfect angel she made herself out to be.Fern, who had admired Liz to the point of hero worship, is appalled and attempts to flee the house, but the girls easily catch her. To buy Fern's silence, Courtney accepts Fern into the clique, telling her to take Liz's place. Courtney and Marcie then give her a makeover, transforming her from plain and awkward to elegant and beautiful. Later in the school cafeteria, Courtney introduces Fern as the beautiful exchange student Vylette. Julie, overwhelmed by guilt at her part in Liz's death, distances herself from the clique, only to be shunned and tormented by her former friends and becomes a new target for abuse throughout the school. Her only real friend during this time is her drama student boyfriend, Zack.Meanwhile, a police detective, Vera Cruz (Pam Grier) begins investigating Liz's death after her body was discovered by her parents who arrived home from a long vacation. With some cooperation from the wary principal Ms. Sherwood (Carol Kane), Detective Cruz interogates all of Liz's friends (Courtney, Marcie, and Julie included). All of them deny knowing anything about Liz's death. Fern/Vylette however comes across as suspicious due to her demeanor. But without any evidence, Cruz allows 'Vylette' to remain free.As Vylette's popularity soars, Julie watches in mute horror as Courtney spins a relentless web of lies, trickery and manipulation to cover up the murder and maintain her popularity at the school.A few days later, Julie learns from Detective Cruz (to her disgust) that after they'd returned Liz's corpse to her house, Courtney went out and seduced a stranger (Marilyn Manson) at a sleazy bar and had sex with him in Liz's bed, making it seem as though he had raped Liz.Meanwhile, Vylette becomes intoxicated with her newfound popularity, which has eclipsed Courtney's own. Realizing she has created a monster, Courtney threatens to reveal the truth about Vylette if she doesn't stop showing off, but Vylette vows she will reveal the whole truth about Liz's death if Courtney attempts to expose her.The next day, an infuriated Courtney and Marcie post enlarged yearbook photos of Fern Mayo all over the school with the message Who is Vylette? written on them, revealing Vylette's true identity. Fern is thoroughly humiliated by the entire school and once again reduced to an outcast. Feeling no remorse for the lives she has destroyed, Courtney casually attends the senior prom with her boyfriend, jock Dane Sanders (Ethan Erickson).Julie takes pity on Fern and forgives her for falling under Courtney's influence. Later that night as she sulks in her room, going through a bag of Liz's belongings that were given to her, Julie finds the recording card she was fiddling with when Courtney was faking Liz's death and discovers it has incidentally recorded Courtney's admission to the murder. Struck with an idea, Julie, Fern and Zack all hurry to the prom. Upon seeing them, Courtney, Marcie and a few of their lackeys call Julie and Fern names and try to embarrass them, but it backfires when the girls completely ignore their taunts and go on with their plan.Later on, as Dane and Courtney are announced as Prom King and Queen, Zack sneaks backstage and broadcasts the card message, I killed Liz! I killed the teen dream! Deal with it!, over the sound system while Courtney is making her acceptance speech. Dane (seized with shock and disgust over the revelation) quickly abandons Courtney. Marcie also runs and hides to distance herself from Courtney. Horrified that her scheme has become unraveled, she races for the exit as the rest of the students pelt her with corsages and call her a murderer. Awaiting Courtney at the very end of the mob is Julie, who gleefully snaps a picture of her former friend's anguished face to immortalize the occasion.

title: Womaneater
synopsis: The title and credits are shown over a painting of a jungle at dusk. We open with a view of the Thames River. A man enters the Explorers Club. In a comfortable club room, Dr. James Moran (George Coulouris) is discussing an interesting tale recounted by a deceased colleague by the name of Ashby. Dr. Patterson (Norman Claridge) and Lewis Carling (Robert MacKenzie) listen with some skepticism. Moran tells them he was made aware of a tribe in the Amazon that can bring the dead back to life. He has a map and he intends to go see for himself. He asks Carling if he wants to join him. Carling thinks the departure date is too soon. Moran is called from the room. Dr. Patterson warns Carling that while brilliant, Moran is very strange and insanity runs in his family. Ultimately, Carling joins Moran and they fly to the Amazon. Hacking through the jungle they spot a mountain noted on Ashby's map. The tribe they seek is related to the Inca. A native ritual is underway when they encounter the tribe. A man and a woman stand on a raised platform. The snake handling witch doctor (Shief Ashanti) presides. The native girl (Marpessa Dawn) appears to be drugged, swaying to the beat of the drums. Carling is overwhelmed by the ceremony, and shouts at the natives. He is killed with a spear. The native girl is led to a large plant, the womaneater, which waves its many arms. She sees the plant and screams as she is pulled towards it. The next day Moran is stricken with jungle fever. He is taken away on a stretcher with very little chance of survival.ENGLAND. Five Years Later. A car pulls up to a large country home. Moran survived and is doing research in his study. He unlocks the door to and enters a well-equipped basement lab. A native man, Tanga (Jimmy Vaughn) plays a drum with a jungle beat. He leads a woman, Susan Curtis (Sara Leighton), towards the same plant we saw five years earlier. The woman is pushed into the plant. Moran notes, She'll become part of the plant. And from it I'll get the serum to bring the dead back to life. She won't have died in vain. Tanga burns her clothes in the furnace as Moran checks on his formula. He injects the formula into an eggplant-shaped object which begins to pulsate. A few minutes later it stops--the formula is a failure.Sergeant Bolton (Edward Higgins) pays a call on Moran. He tells Moran he is making inquires about the disappearance of Susan Curtis. Moran lies, and denies any knowledge. He asks his housekeeper, Mrs. Margaret Santor (Joyce Gregg) if she's seen the girl. Mrs. Santor sees the policeman out.At a carnival we meet Sally Norton (Very Day) helping a barker, Bristow (Harry Ross) the carnival owner, draw customers. She performs a hula dance to entice the crowd. During a break, she meets Jack Venner (Peter Wayn) and agrees to meet him the next day at his garage. Sally was fired because of a fight the night before between Venner and Sally's boss. Venner takes Sally to see Dr. Moran for a job. Sally goes to the door and Tanga greets her. She is shown into the study by Tanga. Moran initially tells her he has no job at the moment, but changes his mind. He asks her, Would you be prepared to live in? She agrees, but later tells Venner, He's rather a strange person though, had a funny look in his eye. Sally grabs her bag and walks up to the house to start her new job. Over Margaret's strong objection, Moran has engaged Sally to help with the housework. Moran warns Margaret, Be nice to her.The police are still investigating the Susan Curtis disappearance. They suspect it may now be murder. They agree that Moran's property needs to be searched. They return to see Moran again. Inspector Brownlow (Maxwell Foster) and Bolton are invited in by Sally. Brownlow asks Morans permission to search the grounds. Of course, they find nothing. Tanga and Moran draw a beaker of plant sap from the womaneater. Moran is convinced he can improve on the formula to restore life.It is too dangerous for Moran to recruit local victims, so he goes to the city. In London, Moran walks the city streets at night. He follows a woman, Judy (Joy Webster), into a private club. The woman has joined a man (David Lawton) at a table for a drink. When the boyfriend becomes angry and walks out, Moran moves in. He pays for her drink and offers her a cigarette. Judy goes off with Moran. Moran takes Judy home and down into the basement lab. Tanga seizes her and prepares her for the plant. Moran returns to his study and is confronted by a suspicious Margaret. Five years before Moran and Margaret had a spark for each other, but Moran is no longer interested in Margaret. I believe you're doing something wicked, Margaret tells Moran. He threatens to send her away. Cowed by the threat, Margaret backs down and returns to her room. Judy is now drugged and prepared for the plant. Tanga plays the drums and then leads Judy to the womaneater. It stands about seven feet tall and has half a dozen branches like arms drawing its victim towards the mouths.The next day Sally visits Jack Venner at his garage. Jack blurts out, Sally, how about us getting married? She thinks it's a crazy idea, as they've only known each other for two weeks. Sally returns to the house late and Mrs. Santor voices her objections to Moran, but she is overruled. Moran tells Sally he is sending Mrs. Santor away and she is to replace her. Sally is reluctant to accept the promotion and tells Moran so. Like Margaret, Sally is suspicious. Moran and Tanga draw off another beaker of plant sap. Sally leaves the house and returns to Jack's garage. She tells Jack, Oh, Jack, I've got to leave that place. I can't stay there. Jack gives her a drink. He tells her not to return, but she tells him she will spend the night and pack and leave the next morning. Margaret admits she's still in love with Moran, but he does not reciprocate. Margaret gets angry at being jilted for a younger woman. She pulls a ceremonial knife off Moran's desk and tries to stab him. He manages to disarm Margaret and chokes her to death.The next morning Sally brings Moran tea. She tells him she won't accept the job. Moran tells Sally she can leave anytime she wishes. Sally returns to her room and packs her clothes. Before she can walk out the front door, Moran uses the final salary ruse to draw her into his study. When pressed for an explanation for refusing the job, Sally tells Moran she's going to marry Jack Venner. Moran expresses his love for Sally. He takes her down into the lab.At police headquarters, Brownlow gets a telephone call that relates to Moran and the plant. Evidence of a girl's clothes was found close to the Moran house. Venner is waiting at the garage; Sally is overdue. He calls the Moran house but gets no answer. Venner drives over to the Moran house. He knocks on the door. Moran answers. He tells Venner that Sally left this morning. Venner tells Moran he thinks Sally is still in the house and he demands to see her. Venner leaves and vows to go straight to the police and report his suspicions. Moran returns to the lab and unlocks the door Sally is behind. He takes her to see the plant. She asks, What is it? Moran answers, It's the great juju of Tanga's tribe. Its their idol. They worship it. Tanga begins playing the drums to the rhythmic movement of the plant's arms. Venner stops at the police station to see Sgt. Bolton. He is told Bolton is out investigating a missing person out by the Moran house.Sally watches as Moran injects his formula into a body on a gurney. The body begins breathing and the pulsometer responds. Margaret sits up and the sheet covering her face falls away. Moran calls to Margaret, but she does not speak. Moran concludes that the body is revived by the formula, but not the mind. Moran accuses Tanga, Your people cheated me. They gave me only half the secret. Our secrets are not for you, Tanga replies. Margaret, mimicking the plant, reaches out and pulls her arms back while she walks towards Sally. Sally screams. Margaret's head snaps back and she falls to the floor. Margaret is once again dead. The police arrive and pound on Moran's door. Venner forces a window and they enter the house. Tanga leads Sally towards the plant. She resists, but Tanga picks her up in his arms and carries her to the plant. Moran, seeing Sally as the next victim of the plant, attacks and struggles with Tanga. While the police search the house, Venner finds the basement lab and takes Sally out as Tanga and Moran struggle. Moran manages to knock the younger man out. He tells Tanga, You've cheated me. Now I'll destroy your Idol as you've destroyed me. Moran throws a flammable liquid on the plant. It bursts into flames. Moran tries to exit the lab, but Tanga awakens and hits him with a knife in his back. We close with Tanga falling to his knees before the burning womaneater plant.

title: No Way to Treat a Lady
synopsis: New York City, 1968: A priest walks briskly up the sidewalk, whistling an odd little tune. He turns in at the entrance of a comfortable old apartment building. Kate Palmer (Lee Remick) is coming down the stairs. Top of the morning to you, young lady, he says, in a lilting Irish accent, as he heads on up the stairs. Hello, Father, she replies, as she passes him. The priest stops in front of Apartment 2B, and knocks. Alma Mulloy (Martine Bartlett) answers, a plump, middle-aged lady in a house dress and hair curlers. The priest introduces himself as Father McDowell, and she lets him in. After exchanging a few pleasantries, she tells him apologetically that if he's there about the church, she's no longer a Catholic...she lost her faith after her husband died. He acknowledges that most of us suffer in this veil of tears, and launches into a rambling discourse about his sainted mother, and (oddly, for a priest) what a beautiful, voluptuous woman she was. But she had a delicate spot on her body, he says, just there, and he touches Mrs. Mulloy on the ribs. She giggles and squirms in spite of herself. He touches the spot again, and again she giggles and squirms. He swiftly moves around in back of the chair where she's sitting, and begins tickling her vigorously with both hands, until she is screaming and writhing with laughter. Suddenly his hands close around her throat, and he laughs like a hyena while he strangles the life out of her. When he is done, he kisses her on the forehead, and murmurs softly, So, now, Mama, you rest in peace. He drags her body into the bathroom and seats her on the toilet. He finds a tube of lipstick and carefully paints a set of full, red, Cupid's Bow lips on her forehead. He stands in the doorway of the bathroom for a last look at his handiwork, blows poor Mrs. Mulloy a kiss and leaves.Morris Brummel (George Segal) is getting dressed in the apartment he shares with his mother. Mrs. Brummel is nagging him about his eating habits, his appearance, his profession (a Jewish cop, of all things!) She compares him to his older brother: a doctor, making a thousand dollars a day, three children...and all she gets from Morris is heartbreak. Morris takes all this more or less in stride, offers only token resistance. The phone rings, and he answers: his boss, Lieutenant Dawson (David Doyle), is calling to tell him that one of the other detectives has fallen ill, and Morris has been assigned to the Mulloy homicide in his place.Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger) comes downstairs to breakfast, a well-to-do, middle-aged bachelor, living a quiet, orderly life. Nevertheless, we see he is the man who, disguised as a priest, strangled Mrs. Mulloy the previous day. He sits down at his dining room table, and Mrs. Fitts (Irene Daily), his quiet, professional housekeeper, brings him his morning newspapers. He searches through the first without success, but finds what he's looking for near the end of the second: a very brief paragraph announcing the murder of Mrs. Mulloy. He calls the newspaper to complain about the placement and lack of detail. An assistant editor replies that it was probably due to the fact that they were racing a deadline. May I ask who's calling? he says. Gill hangs up. No, you may not, he mutters.Morris arrives at Mrs. Mulloy's apartment, swarming with police, technicians and reporters. He finds the super and asks which tenant saw the priest at Mrs. Mulloy's door. He replies, 3E, directly above. As they head upstairs, a reporter asks Morris if he can get a quote. Morris tells him no, unless he wants to print that the murder was well-planned and well-executed.Kate is slow to answer. When the door opens, she is still half asleep, and not very helpful...but undeniably lovely. Morris asks if she can describe the priest. If you've seen one priest, you've seen them all, she replies. He asks if he had any distinguishing features. You mean, like a big nose? I can't remember. But you've got kind of a sweet-looking nose, there, yourself, she adds flirtatiously. Then she realizes that she's barely dressed in a rather revealing nightie. She tells him she's going back to bed, and he should come back later. I meant that about your nose, she says, with a little smile, as she stretches out on her bed. Morris leaves, but pauses in the hall just outside her door...and feels his nose.Later in the day, after Mrs. Brummel has seen the papers, she calls Morris: I am sick at my heart when my own son goes looking at dead women's naked bodies. I tell you, Morris, it is no way to treat a lady.Mrs. Himmel (Ruth White), a plump, middle-aged German lady, has just fixed a tray for herself and settled down in front of her television, when there's a knock at her door. She answers, and a gray-haired German plumber (Gill) tells her apologetically, I have to pound on your water pipes. Oh, no, says Mrs. Himmel, Not on MY pipes...you go somewhere else. She starts to shut the door, but he interrupts, What do you mean, go somewhere else? That's the trouble with the world. No one has any sympathy for anyone else, anymore. Well, I'll tell you something, it was a sad day when I left Frankfurt. He turns to leave. Frankfurt! Mrs. Himmel exclaims, You're from Frankfurt? I'm from Frankfurt, too! Well, it's a small world, says the plumber, and turns back. I'm sorry I yelled at you, she says, contritely, and lets him in. He heads for the kitchen, but stops when he sees the cake on her tray. Baumkuchen! he exclaims, I haven't had baumkuchen since I left Frankfurt! Have a piece, she says, kindly. She asks if he'd like to look at some old photos of Frankfurt. He directs her to sit on the couch, so he can stand behind her and look over her shoulder. Look, look, look! he exclaims, pointing, There's my friend, Fritz, right there...he's waving to you... Mrs. Himmel looks closer, confused. He's saying, 'Goodbye, Mrs. Himmel...auf wiedersehen'. He kisses her on the cheek. And in the next scene, poor Mrs. Himmel is seated on the toilet in her bathroom, with Cupid's Bow lips painted on her forehead. The plumber surveys his handiwork from the doorway.Morris is in the squad room, looking through fingerprint reports. Another detective, Monaghan (Val Bisoglio) asks what he's still doing here...it's past 10 p.m....asks why he doesn't get married. You sound like my mother, says Morris. The phone rings and he answers. Gill, still speaking with a German accent, introduces himself as Hans Schultz. At least, that's who I am today, he says, but last week I was Father Kevin McDowell. What do you want? asks Morris impatiently. I just want to tell you, says Gill, slowly, that I'm in Mrs. Himmel's apartment, and she is...quite dead. Though momentarily stunned, Morris recovers quickly. He attracts Monaghan's attention, who quietly picks up his own phone and requests a trace. Morris sets out to keep Gill talking as long as he can. But Gill, enjoying himself immensely, lets Morris know that he's familiar with call tracing, and knows just how long he can stay on the line before they locate him. He tells Morris that he liked the quote in the newspaper, about Mrs. Mulloy's murder being well-planned and well-executed. He gives Morris Mrs. Himmel's address, so he can come and see that her murder is well up to his previous standard...And I want you to put that in the newspaper, he adds. In fact, I insist on it. And he hangs up.The police, the technicians, and the reporters all swarm over to Mrs. Himmel's apartment. Morris looks at Mrs. Himmel, and turns away, disgusted and discouraged.Gill is seated at his dining room table, humming his tune. Mrs. Fitts brings in his daily newspaper. This time, what he's looking for is splashed all over the second page. He smiles while he reads his notices.Kate Palmer has come to the precinct, to look at mug shots. Once again, she hasn't been much help...Some people remember faces, she says, with me, it's names. Morris offers to take her home, and they catch a bus at a nearby stop. She asks if he's a good detective; he replies modestly that he thinks so. And she teases him, saying she doubts it, since he'd insisted on her coming in even though she'd told him she wouldn't be any help. You know what I think? she says, impudently, I think you just wanted to see me again. Morris starts to protest...she laughs and says Fibbing. Well, he finally admits, I might have fibbed a little. They both smile. She looks around, and tells him this is their stop. They get off the bus, and as it pulls away, we see that Gill is there, watching them through the rear window. He's in another disguise, on his way to another victim.The camera cuts back to Morris and Kate, walking along the street. Why did you move? he asks. The ghost of Mrs. Mulloy finally got to me, she says. She remarks on what a fancy name he has. What's your first name? she asks. Morris, he answers, sheepishly. She laughs...I'll bet everyone calls you Moe. They do, he admits, and they both laugh at his funny name. They stop at the door to her apartment building, and he tells her goodbye. Was there something you wanted to ask? she prompts him. He hesitates, knowing he's not in this beautiful, elegant woman's league...then finally says, I guess not. Then he blurts out, Oh, well...maybe I could call you...say, Saturday night? Don't bother, she replies, poker-faced. Huh? he says, a bit confused. Calling, she finishes with a smile. I'll be ready at eight. He smiles, too, and walks on. She looks fondly after him, still chuckling over the name Moe Brummel.Gill walks up the hallway of another apartment building, dressed in a navy-blue jacket and yellow slacks, carrying a striped hat box. He pauses in front of a door and rings the bell. Miss Belle Poppie? he calls, in a lisping, effeminate voice. Inside the apartment, a middle-aged woman in a lace caftan (Barbara Baxley) gets up from her typewriter, and asks, Who is it? It's Dorian Smith, dear, he replies, I've brought your wig. Miss Poppie is puzzled, but Dorian assures her she won a contest after signing a coupon at the drugstore. She opens the door about six inches, keeping it on the chain, and asks, No strings? Absolutely none, he replies. All right, I'll take it, she says, holding out her hand. Oh, no, says Dorian. I have to fit it for you...otherwise you'll look absolutely dreadful. She hesitates, but after making him promise he'll speak in a soft, low voice, so not to disturb her five cats, she lets him in. He directs her to sit on the couch, and takes a mirror off the wall so she can watch as he fits the wig. After some adjustment he asks, Now...what do you think of that? I don't like it, she says. Well, that's because I haven't finished, he tells her. It needs to be fitted in here, and tucked in here, by your neck...you do have a lovely neck, don't you... His facial expression hardens and his hands move into position...but just before they close on her throat the front door opens, and another middle-aged woman bustles into the room. It's only me, Belle, she says, and look what I brought for the babies! She hands her a deluxe, new scratching post. Belle admires it, then introduces the woman as her sister, Sylvia (Doris Roberts). Belle tells Sylvia that she's won a wig, and Mr. Smith is here to fit it for her. Do you like it? she asks Sylvia. No, says Sylvia, bluntly. But I guess if you won it, you won it. She looks at Dorian, and asks suspiciously, and you're absolutely sure it's free? He decides two Poppie sisters are more than he can handle. Of course, he says. She gets the wig, and a custom fitting, and if she's still not happy with it, at the end of two months she'll get every penny of her money back. The two women begin to protest, with Belle saying, That's dishonest! He shouts, Absolutely no one ever calls me dishonest! He gathers up the wigs and the hatbox and storms over to the door. Sylvia calls him a homo. He pauses with his hand on the door knob, says, Doesn't make you a bad person, and flounces out.Morris is at home, sitting at the table, reading crime scene reports and whistling softly. His mother brings in two plates, sets one down in front of him, and asks point blank, So, who is this girl you're thinking about? He tries to change the subject...asks if they didn't have kneidlach last night. Loss of appetite...that's the first sign, she declares. He asks her to just lay off for once, and she says, Temper...that's the second sign. She asks if the girl is Jewish and Morris admits he doesn't know. Mrs. Brummel is distraught at the idea of Morris dating a shiksa! They are wrangling back and forth when the phone rings...Morris answers. It's Gill, using his Dorian voice...he's calling from a wall phone just outside his latest victim's bathroom, where she's sitting in state with the usual artwork on her forehead. Oh, Morris, he says, I've been a bad boy, again. At first Morris doesn't realize who he's talking to, and Gill blasts him for forgetting so soon. He rambles on about his brilliant characterizations, even giving Morris a sample of his uncanny W.C. Fields impersonation. Morris asks quietly if they can talk, one human being to another. Oh, no, says Gill, with a shaky little laugh. And I'm not going to tell you where I am this time, either...you'll have to figure it out for yourself. And he hangs up.They find the latest victim's apartment. A technician finds a few strands of long, blonde hair that don't match the victim...asks if there was a wig found in any of her stuff. They tell him no. I don't know, complains Morris, how can you figure with a pervert like this? The technician replies, We don't know he's a pervert. It could be some sort of distorted mother image. Morris mutters to Monaghan, Imagine wanting to strangle your mother. A lurking reporter asks Morris if he can quote him on that...Morris yells no, and has the uniformed officers escort him out.Back at the station, Morris calls Kate to cancel their date. The moment she hears his voice, she begins to talk excitedly about the dinner she's prepared...she watched that Julia Child woman, and has to admit it smells pretty great. Morris tells her, apologetically, that he can't make it, he has to work. Disappointed, annoyed, she says, Oh, well...okay. Just a small, crummy dinner. It probably tastes rotten, anyway. Maybe I could come over later, he suggests. What for? she retorts. I don't know, he stammers, I thought...maybe... Morris, she says, with finality, I'm going to hang up now. Goodbye. Goodbye, he murmurs, dejectedly. Morris? she says, Tonight you be careful, all right? And then hangs up. Morris's face lights up...Do you know what she said to me? he asks Monaghan. She said, 'Be careful.' Isn't that beautiful?Gill is on his way to work, walking down the sidewalk with his briefcase, whistling his tune. He stops at a newsstand and buys a paper. He opens a nearby wrought-iron gate, goes down the alley beyond, and enters the building...which turns out to be a theatre. He takes his private elevator to his office, takes the two wigs he was using as props out of his briefcase and puts them away. Then he opens a paper to read his latest notices...only to be greeted by the headline, Killer is a Sexual Pervert.Morris is at his desk, with a tape recorder running, and several detectives standing around listening. Gill is so angry he is almost in tears. You had no right to call me a pervert, and you had no right to bring my mother into the story! he screams, as Hans Schultz. My mother and I were famously close! And we LOVED each other! I want a retraction! I can't do that, says Morris. I don't care, Gill screams, I want a retraction printed, or you will suffer the consequences! I am NOT a pervert...and you will NOT dishonor my mother!Morris, Monaghan, Lieutenant Dawson and another man are in the office of Inspector Haines (Murray Hamilton), listening to the tape of this conversation. Inspector Haines is not happy. When the tape ends, he asks Morris if he feels qualified to psychoanalyze this killer. Morris says no. Then you didn't state that he's a sexual pervert? asks Inspector Haines. Well, not for the record, sir, says Morris. Our own expert on Freud, says the inspector, sarcastically. It might interest you to know that Dr. Shaffer, here, agrees with you, he says, gesturing at the doctor. Whatever theories you have, Dr. Shaffer, you'll be sharing them with Lieutenant Dawson, Detective Monaghan and five more detectives from the homicide squad. He looks at Morris, and says, Brummel, I'm taking you off the case. In fact, I want you to stay home for a few days. Don't talk to the press, don't do anything. You see, we can't print a retraction for your opinions, but maybe if we take you off the case, that will placate this madman. He continues, outlining safety measures he wants to have implemented, which includes dispatching officers to women's hotels and apartment houses that cater to women. Tell them to stay inside, he says. Tell them to keep their doors locked.A uniformed policeman, his back to the camera, is knocking on an apartment door. A middle-aged woman in a green suit and mustard-colored hat comes out of another door, glares at him, and walks by. A middle-aged lady in a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around her head opens the door, and is startled to see him. What have I done? she asks. You haven't done anything, ma'am, he says, in a familiar voice. Officer Brummel, 19th Precinct...I'm just giving out some precautionary information to women who live alone. May I come in and explain? Oh, yes, please do, she says, smiling, and steps to one side to let him in. The camera switches to the officer's face: it is Gill. Thank you, ma'am, he says, and walks in.Morris is at home, getting ready to go out. So where are you taking her? his mother asks. Nowhere, he replies. Nowhere is a place? she asks. As they banter back and forth the phone rings, and Mrs. Brummel answers. Gill asks to speak with Morris, using a Cary Grant accent. Morris, Mrs. Brummel whispers, It's HIM! Morris takes the phone from her, and says Yeah?  'Ello, Morrie, 'ow are you? says Gill. Listen...I think it's terrible the way the police are treating you, I think it's absolutely humiliating. You tell 'em I'm not going to talk to anyone else but you. You tell them to put you back on the case or I'm liable to be a very naughty boy again tonight. Hey, says Morris, Don't do that, come on! I've got the simply sensational idea of guarding that woman what said she saw me dressed up in a police uniform, says Gill. He recites a bad limerick about Morris and the Strangler, then says Cheery-bye, Morrie, and hangs up.Morris hurries down to the precinct, and persuades Monaghan to give him her file, the witness's file in spite of the trouble it could cause both of them. Her name is Pearl Menzel, says Monaghan. You probably won't find her, though. I think she left town as soon as she talked to the newspapers. Or else she's boozing it up in some gin mill.Morris arrives at one of the bars she is known to frequent, a rundown neighborhood dive, and asks the bartender (Val Avery) if he's seen Pearl Menzel. The bartender says no. Are you positive? asks Morris. As positive as I am that you're a cop, says the bartender, evenly. Morris decides no help is forthcoming from this quarter, and leaves. Shortly afterward, Sadie comes in: a tall, plump lady wearing a sleeveless black sheath, stiletto heels, a '60's bubble hairdo, and lots of make-up. She sits at the bar and orders a double Pink Lady in a suspiciously deep voice. While the bartender is getting it, she turns around and tells a bad joke as a come-on to a couple of guys sitting at a table. They rebuff her, and she turns to the man sitting next to her, and recites a bad limerick about the Strangler. A middle-aged woman at the end of the bar who's been sniffling into a handkerchief begins to cry, loudly. Knock it off, growls the bartender to Sadie. Can't you see she's scared to death? Sadie retorts, Well, who isn't? Yeah, but she says she saw him, says the bartender. Oh, says Sadie, chastened. She goes around the bar to the woman, to comfort her. She asks if the woman has anywhere to go. The woman sobs no. Sadie invites her to come home with her. I just live across the street, she says, He won't attack two of us together. The woman hesitates. Come on, coaxes Sadie, We'll watch TV, have a few drinks...we'll have a ball. The woman agrees and they walk out together, with Sadie supporting the smaller woman as she sobs into her handkerchief.Morris has been checking the bar next door...he sees the women come out and cross the street, and gets a sudden hunch. He runs back down into the first bar, and asks the bartender who the hooker was. What hooker? says the bartender, stolidly. The hooker that just left here...who is she, and where does she live? How would I know? says the bartender, I don't ask for people's credentials. Morris turns to a couple of apple-cheeked frat boys sitting at the bar, and says, Say, are you two familiar with the legal age for drinking in this state? All right, all right, says the bartender. She just moved into that brownstone across the street, basement apartment.Sadie settles the woman on her couch, still quietly crying. You know what I think, Sadie says, I think you should call the cops. You need to get yourself some protection. She lights a cigarette, and heads for the refrigerator. I can't, sobs the woman. Well, it's up to you and your own conscience, says Sadie, but just remember, he's killed four women. Five, sobs the woman. Five? repeats Sadie, surprised. I didn't know it was five. It is now, the other woman growls in a masculine voice. She sits up, and we see it's Gill.Who was that woman with her, was it Pearl Menzel? Morris asks. No, says the bartender, THAT'S Pearl Menzel, and points to a woman in a green suit with a mustard-colored hat at the other end of the bar. Well, keep her here, says Morris, and runs out. He crosses the street, and runs down the stairs to Sadie's apartment. The door is open. He draws his gun and cautiously enters...the room is a wreck. He finds Sadie in the bathroom, sprawled on the toilet, a hasty Cupid's Bow smeared on her forehead. On the mirror above the sink, scrawled in red lipstick and underlined three times, are the words: Reinstate Morris.They are all back in Inspector Haines's office. I want all press releases on this latest murder to include the fact that Detective Brummel has been put in charge of the case again, he says. I'm doing this solely at the recommendation of Dr. Shaffer. But I want everyone here to know that I still consider Lieutenant Dawson to be in charge. They all start to file out. Brummel, he says to Morris, who turns back toward him. How do you feel about all this? Lousy, sir, says Morris. How would you feel? The Inspector replies, Lousy. Morris turns to leave again, saying, Right...That's the word.Gill walks down the street and turns in at Sardi's. He is greeted cordially by the maître d, and shown to his usual table. His waiter asks what he would like, and Gill replies he'd like something French. And he asks for a telephone. May I have Monsieur Brummel, s'il vous plait? he says, in a French accent. Maurice Dubois here...'ow do you like my new accent? Do I sound like Maurice Chevalier? I am very happy that they...uh, how you say...reinstate you. C'est bon, ca. That's very good, very French. says Morris. He is surrounded by detectives, again, including Lieutenant Dawson, and the tape is running. How about a little more? Ah, no, no, no, mon ami, replies Gill, because if I take too much time you trace the call. I just called to say I start my vacation, and I promise not to be a bad boy. I give you my word of honor. A tout à l'heure. Hold on...Can't you wait just a second? asks Morris, trying to stall. But Gill is gone.Kate is leading a tour at the Lincoln Center, where she works. They are looking at the sculptures in the plaza, walking from one to the next, while she relates their points of interest. She passes Morris, sitting on the edge of a planter box, looking a bit hang-dog, without acknowledging him. He gets up and joins the group, a little off to one side. As she is talking about the Mark Chagall painting, without any change in his expression he opens the right side of his suit jacket and shows her his gun in its holster...she starts to laugh, barely able to finish. She leads the tour group away, and Morris follows, apparently forgiven. They are both unaware that Gill is watching from across the plaza.They have lunch together, at an outdoor cafe. She says, So you finally found out. He asks, Found out what? She replies, That I'm the Strangler. How else can you spare me these few precious minutes? Oh, at first that was one of the things I liked about you, that you didn't try to make a pass at me right off. But don't you think you're carrying a good thing a little too far? He says nothing, still a little shy with this lovely woman. Morris, would it bother you if we stopped seeing each other? she asks. Yes, of course, says Morris, emphatically...but seems unable to say anything further. What do I do wrong? she asks, frustrated. Is a Jewish cop so wrong for me? The thing is, he says, and hesitates...I want to show you my yacht, he says. Yacht?! she says in disbelief. My yacht, he says, firmly.They are on a police launch, cruising around the harbor. They sit down in the stern, look at each other and smile. To tell you the truth, Morris, Kate says, I've had him. Had who? he asks. Randy Beautiful, she replies. And he was beautiful, old Randy...good future, good family...good everything. And then one day, I don't know...the message just came to me. I turned over and tapped him on the top of his beautiful head, and said, 'You only love me for my body, not for myself...for my mind.' And he screamed, 'What mind? Any thought of yours would die of loneliness.' So I got up, got dressed, packed my little suitcase, and I left Randy Beautiful...and his good family, and his good future. Tell me the truth, Morris...Do I have a good mind? Morris replies earnestly, You have a brilliant mind. And you got hung up on me because of my mind? she asks. Yes, he replies, without hesitation. Are you tender, Morris? she asks, wistfully. You can have me if you say yes. Yes, he says, firmly. Do you love me, Morris? she asks. He hesitates a moment, then replies, Yes, I think so. She smiles and says, It's sort of nice, isn't it? Yes, sort of, he says, and he smiles, too. Kiss me, Morris, she says, and he leans over and kisses her, a bit awkwardly because of the way they're sitting. They both stand up and kiss again...and Morris is tender...and they keep on kissing.Morris is sitting at his desk, alone in the squad room. A uniformed officer brings in Mr. Kupperman (Michael Dunn). He stands at Morris's desk and says, Ok, you got me. For what? Morris asks, blankly. What do you think?! snaps Mr. Kupperman. You're the Strangler? Morris asks, incredulously. He can be forgiven his doubt...Mr. Kupperman is, after all, just under four feet tall. I killed them all, says Mr. Kupperman, smiling proudly. Mr. Kupperman... Morris begins. You be careful what you're going to say, interrupts Mr. Kupperman, I'm very sensitive on certain subjects. Morris begins again...Well, naturally, I wouldn't bring it up if it didn't have some bearing on the case, but...you're a midget. The few witnesses we have claim that he was of normal...uh...that is to say...he was taller than you. You see how I fooled them, says Mr. Kupperman, eagerly. Did you talk to me several times on the phone? asks Morris. That's right, says Mr. Kupperman. Morris hands him the mike to the tape recorder on his desk, and says, Imitate Barry Fitzgerald. Mr. Kupperman does so...very badly. Morris reaches for the mike, and Mr. Kupperman says, Wait...I can do W.C. Fields. This effort is only slightly better. Morris takes the mike from him and says, Mr. Kupperman, I just don't believe you're the Strangler. Bigot! You're a bigot! declares Mr. Kupperman. No, I'm not, protests Morris. Have you got any friends who are midgets? says Mr. Kupperman, getting louder. Would you want your sister to marry one? I haven't got a sister! Morris replies, getting louder himself. That's a bigot's answer if ever I heard one! Mr. Kupperman shouts. Lieutenant Dawson's door opens: he pokes his head out, looks at them, nods slightly, and goes back inside. I'm very sorry, Mr. Kupperman, says Morris, quietly, but you're going to have to leave now. You're turning me loose to murder again, says Mr. Kupperman, bitterly. All right, but this is what it's going to say in tomorrow's paper. He grabs a piece of chalk off Morris's desk and writes 6th Victim on one of the partitions. He throws the chalk at Morris and stamps out. Morris stares at the words for a moment, then he knocks on Lt. Dawson's door. I've got an idea, he says. It's kind of crazy, but it just might shake things up.Gill is seated at his grand piano, playing a lovely, peaceful melody. Mrs. Fitts brings in a vase filled with flowers. He asks her if his airline tickets have arrived, and she says yes. He tells her that the flowers are lovely. Romance, he says, smiling a little as he plays...Romance is the thing that makes men hold, and women bold, Mrs. Fitts. If you read the papers, there isn't much love in them these days, she responds, stepping out of her quiet, professional demeanor, for once. Riots, and wars...and all these murders. It's getting so I don't dare set foot outside anymore. Imagine, Mr. Gill, one man killing six women! What do you mean? says Gill, startled. Here, she says, and hands him his paper. The headline reads Sixth Victim. Killed the same way as the others, she says, with the lipstick across the forehead and everything. Yes, he says, slowly, preoccupied, yes. Uh, could I have my tea, now? Yes, of course...I'm sorry, she says, stepping back behind her mask, leaving him alone to contemplate this new development.He calls from a public phone booth. When Morris answers, he tells him in his German accent that he didn't do it...he did NOT kill that woman. Say you believe me, he says. I can't say that, because I don't believe you, replies Morris. The detectives are standing around him, the tape is running. It's a copycat, insists Gill. I did everything up to now, and he comes along and wants to take credit, and it's not fair! Morris, enjoying the upper hand for once, replies, This is getting a little too weird for me, I think I'll hang up now. Don't you hang up on me, hisses Gill, or I'll kill a hundred women...I promise you that. He tries to calm down, so he can reason with Morris. A little common sense will tell you that it's a copycat. Did he call you on the phone? Did he tell you where the body was? Neither did you the first and fourth time, counters Morris. But you forget, says Gill. I've given you my word of honor that I'll stop. Morris murmurs, For all that's worth. A uniformed officer enters the squad room and says, quietly, Pan Am Building, downtown. The lieutenant and a couple of other detectives rush out. Gill continues to argue his innocence regarding the sixth victim...but Morris interrupts, saying, This time we got a full description of you. You're very short...you have blonde hair...a wide nose...bushy eyebrows. Gill laughs, and says, That's very funny, you see, because first of all I have brown hair, brown eyes, and I'm approximately six feet tall, and... then, finally realizing, ...and you are clever. Oh, Mr. Brummel, you are very, very clever. He hangs up. But you're not quite clever enough, he adds, and leaves the building...swiftly, but not hastily. Uniformed officers arrive at the building first, and round up a few suspects. But when Morris, Monaghan and Lt. Dawson arrive, it's obvious they didn't net the one they really wanted.Morris and Kate arrive in the hallway just outside Morris's apartment. Ok, I think I'm ready, says Kate. But tell me, Morris, do you love me? Yes, he replies. Madly, deeply? she asks. Madly, deeply, he confirms. Then I can move mountains, she says. He unlocks the door and they go inside. After introductions, Kate says to Mrs. Brummel, It's such a pleasure to finally meet you...and to see your lovely home. Morris, look at this, she says, gesturing, Isn't it wonderful? It's just so Jewish. Mrs. Brummel is rather flummoxed by this comment, not sure it's a compliment. What? she says. Well, Jews always have the best apartments, replies Kate. The best taste, the best apartments...it follows. Are you Jewish? asks Mrs. Brummel, brightening. I have been studying to be Jewish since I was 14 years old, says Kate, as they move ino the living room and sit down. Off! Kate exclaims suddenly. What? says Mrs. Brummel, startled. Look at him, Kate gestures toward Morris. He has his foot up on your coffee table. Off! she orders, and he moves his foot. Lummox, she murmurs. Honestly, I don't know why I go out with him. On the money he makes we can't do anything. A Jewish cop, can you imagine anything so ridiculous? I keep telling him that! says Mrs. Brummel, amazed. Oh, but your son, Franklin, says Kate, with a smile. I wish I'd met him before it was too late. With a son like him, you don't mind having this one so much. But he is good for one thing, she adds. Morris, light my cigarette, she orders. He jumps to his feet, comes to stand in front of her, with his back to his mother. He gives her a faint, conspiratorial smile while he lights her cigarette. She smiles back, and blows him a secret, little air-kiss. Now, go away, she says. He walks dejectedly into the kitchen. He's good for ordering around, says Kate to Mrs. Brummel, for yelling at and ordering around. He is, agrees Mrs. Brummel, delighted. I can see we're the same person, says Kate. Yes, we are, agrees Mrs. Brummel. Would you excuse me a moment, please? Of course, says Kate. Mrs. Brummel slips into the kitchen and says to Morris, That girl is a gem...a GEM! And you know something else? She reminds me of me. Kate breathes a long sigh of relief, and relaxes.Morris is waiting outside the lieutenant's office. Monaghan comes out and Morris says, Well? Monaghan replies, He says the chief doesn't like it, the inspector doesn't like it, and he doesn't like it. Morris looks crestfallen. But the commissioner... continues Monaghan, and Morris looks up, hopeful... The commissioner says we've got a phony body, we might as well have a phony suspect. Morris laughs and slaps Monaghan on the back. When? he asks. It'll be in the papers tomorrow, Monaghan replies. It better work this time. It will, it will, you're such a worrier, replies Morris, and they go on out together.Gill calls Morris again, from another public phone booth. He says in his German accent, Morris, I'm glad I caught you...I'm relieved because I read in the newspaper about this William Gibson of Tudor City, and now we know he had nothing to do with the first five, but that he's definitely responsible for the sixth, so, at last! You know, I think its important that we get the facts straight... Morris interrupts him to say, You can forget the whole thing. We're letting him go. The evidence we had on him only ties up to the last killing. Yes, I know it ties up with the last killing, says Gill, impatiently, but you can't let him go, and he goes out and copies me again. I dont think so, Dorian, says Morris. As far as I'm concerned, you've still got six. That's a lie! shouts Gill. Oh, you're losing your temper, Dorian, taunts Morris. Then he says, Oh, thank you, detective, to the air. Word reaches me that he's already been released. Released?! says Gill, shocked. He hangs up. Released, he murmurs, clearly shaken. He hung up! says Morris to Monaghan, with mock surprise. They've shaken the Strangler up again...maybe he'll make another mistake.Kate is at home, studying up on Jewish food, history and culture. A man arrives outside her door, with a large, elaborate food-keeper. He rings the doorbell; she goes to answer, checking through the peephole first. Poor Kate, with her memory for names, not faces, doesn't recognize Father McDowell standing there in a maître d uniform. She opens the door, keeping it on the chain, and says, Yes? Miss Kate Palmer? he asks, and when she affirms that she is, he says, I'm from the Italian restaurant around the corner, I was asked by Mr. Morris Brummel to bring this to you. What is it? she asks. Well, he replies, I have some nice homemade spaghetti, and veal piccata with a little lemon juice, a salad, and spumoni, and café expresso...and last but not least, Valpolicella wine. Mr. Brummel sends it all with his love and regret that the lady has to eat alone. Morris? she says, agreeably surprised. I'll be damned. And she lets him in. He asks if he might use the table on the dais to serve her, and she agrees. He pulls out a chair for her, and she sits down. He puts his food-keeper down, and looks at her the way a wolf might look at a wandering lamb.Morris is at home, with reports and files from the case spread all over the table. Mrs. Brummel comes in with a tray and begins to clear them off. What are you doing? he asks, irritated. I'm making you a meatloaf sandwich, she replies. I don't want a meatloaf sandwich, he says, trying to fend her off. The phone rings; she picks it up and hands it to him, saying, Tell Kate Palmer you won't eat a meatloaf sandwich. Morris answers...it's Monaghan. He tells Morris that Gill called again. Why didn't he call me? asks Morris, puzzled. He left a number where you could call him, if you want to talk to him, says Monaghan. Morris gets a pencil to write it down. 555-3310, says Monaghan. My God, that's Kate! says Morris, his face turning sick. I'll send a car, says Monaghan. No, no...subway's faster, says Morris, Get over there...go, go, go! He grabs his coat and tells Mrs. Brummel, Call Kate and tell her I'm on my way. She starts to sputter and he shouts, Just CALL her! and leaves. He runs to the subway station and shows his badge to get through the turnstile. Monaghan, on his way in a car with more officers, tries to call Kate as well.Gill is serving the nice dinner to Kate. The phone rings and she stands up. Don't answer it, orders Gill. It might be important, she says and goes to the phone. I said, don't answer it! he shouts, and in two strides he's at the phone plug, and rips it from the wall. She stares at him in shock, as the truth dawns on her. Why me? she asks, softly. Why don't you ask him, he replies. She takes a step backward, and he takes two steps toward her...then they're both running...she for the door, and he after her. He catches her before she can get out, but she is able to pull away and elude him, twice. But when she comes back to the door the third time, he finally gets a good grip on her, and clamps his hand over her nose and mouth. She slowly slides to the floor as she loses consciousness.Monaghan and the boys are at the outside door, ringing the buzzer frantically. The super admits them and they run to Kate's apartment. Gill comes out a side door, wiping his hands, and walks hurriedly away. A policeman in a car spots him, and turns around to follow. Morris arrives at Kate's apartment. It looks very like the crime scenes of the other five victims, with photographers, technicians, and reporters already on scene. He dashes to the bathroom, but, mercifully, she's not there. Monaghan comes out of another room, and beckons to him. He goes inside...Kate is lying on her bed, eyes closed, a damp cloth on her forehead. She opens her eyes and looks at him...she's all right, except for the Strangler's finger marks on her neck. He sits by her side, she caresses his face...he kisses her hand...and they embrace.Outside, Morris speaks with Monaghan and another detective, who reports that a man was seen and followed as far as 44th and Sixth. They have cars in the area looking for him. Morris and Monaghan head to the area to join the manhunt. Gill has the advantage...he knows the district very well, and is able to stay ahead of them. But he is seen going down the alleyway to his private entrance, and the officers converge on the theatre. They gain entry to the lobby, where they are greeted by the Gill Theatre's well-known owner, Christopher Gill...a man above suspicion. They ask if he saw or heard anyone, he replies that, no, it's been very quiet. They ask if they can search the theatre. He consents, even offers to give them a little more light. They search the place from basement to roof, while he calmly watches. They return to the lobby, and admit they found nothing. He bids them good night. As they leave, Morris pauses in front of a large portrait of a middle-aged woman in period costume. It is one of several in the lobby, of the same woman in different period costumes. Rather a striking portrait of my mother, don't you think? asks Gill. Did you ever see her on stage? No, says Morris, I missed that. You missed something, Gill says softly, with pride. He watches the officers leave, then glances back at the portrait of his mother. The camera zooms in on her full, red, Cupid's Bow lips.Gill is in his office, drinking a toast to his mother. He stands in front of a bust of her, dressed as Cleopatra, and recites her speech from Anthony and Cleopatra, with closed eyes. When he finishes, he sees Morris in the doorway. You surprise me, he says, I thought you and I were finished. Morris replies, We haven't even started. Gill tries to bluff his way through...but Morris demonstrates he has put the pieces together. He points out Gill's acess to a wardrobe department, and his penchant for accents. He taunts him about his mother, wonders what she really thought of him...and what she'd have thought of a freak that strangles women? He picks up a picture of Gill's mother from Gill's desk, and continues, They all had the lipstick, didn't they? The very shape of your dear mother's lips. The very lips on all those portraits out in your lobby! Morris asks for the key to the wardrobe department. I don't have to give it to you, says Gill. No, agrees Morris. we can come back for it. I don't want YOU to come back, says Gill, petulantly. He goes to the cupboard where the keys are kept. When his back is turned, Morris puts the glass he was drinking from in his pocket. When Gill turns around with the key, Morris takes it and leaves the office.Morris goes down the stairs to the stage level and down another set of stairs that goes under the stage. Gill watches from a window in his office, then takes his elevator to the stage level, to do battle with Morris on his own familiar ground. He turns off all the lights, leaving only an eerie red glow from the exit signs. Morris finally realizes his danger, and comes up from beneath the stage with his gun drawn. As he moves cautiously across the stage, he is almost knocked down by a heavy scenery flat, then narrowly misses getting beaned by a light frame released from above. He sees a figure running in the red glow, and fires his gun at it. He looks behind him, and turns back in time to get a counterweight in the face, which knocks him out cold. A spotlight comes up and focuses on the stage. Christopher Gill comes out, staggering, holding his side, which is bloody. Almost falling, he grabs hold of the counterweight rope to break his fall. He drags himself over to where Morris is lying, and grabs Morris's gun. He lies there for a moment, his head resting on Morris's stomach. Mr. Brummel, you're a better shot than I thought you were, he murmurs. He finally pulls himself up to a standing position, and looks out into the empty theatre. Hallucinating, he sees Mrs. Mulloy, there...and shouts at her in Father McDowell's voice. He also sees Mrs. Himmel, and addresses her in Hans Schultz's voice, punctuating his last soliliquy by firing shots into the air from Morris's gun. He slips on his own blood, and falls back on the stage. Oh, help! he murmurs...then in Dorian's voice he pleads, Sweet Jesus...save me. He looks around for Morris, who has regained consciousness and is now standing in the audience watching Gill, his expression impassive. Mr. Brummel, do me a favor, says Gill, Forgive me. Morris's expression doesn't change...no forgiveness here. Puh-leeeeeeeze, begs Gill. Then he covers his face, and with a last, sobbing breath, dies. Monaghan and the other officers file back into the theatre and move up onto the stage, ready to investigate one more crime scene. Morris turns and walks out of the theatre. In the lobby, he pauses between two of Gill's mother's portraits to look back into the theatre, at the last scene being played out on the stage. Then he goes out of the theatre altogether, onto the street, into the early morning light.

title: April Fool's Day
synopsis: In the cellar of her house, Muffy St. John (Deborah Forman) picks up a jack-in-the-box, and thinks back to her 10th birthday party where she received it as a birthday gift (a tiny alien which jumped out and scared her, making the other party guests laugh).Meanwhile, a group of young college students wait at a dock to be picked up by a ferry and transported to Muffy's island cottage for the weekend. They include Kit (Amy Steel), and her boyfriend Rob (Ken Olandt), Nikki (Deborah Goodrich) and her boyfriend Chaz (Clayton Rohner), and Arch (Thomas F. Wilson) whom are best friends. The rest of the group includes Nan (Leah King Pinsent), Hal (Jay Baker), and Muffy's cousin Skip (Griffin ONeal). On the ferry, Skip and Arch play a game of 'stretch' (throwing a switchblade and both trying to stretch for it), until an irritated Arch throws the blade at Skip and hits him in the stomach. Skip falls off into the water in which the ferry crewman Buck (Mike Nomad) and Rob jump in only to see Skip with a trick knife-belt. Skip and Arch laugh at their April Fool's Day joke which happens to be that very day. Buck stays in the water and tries to hook the ferry as it comes into the dock, and as the group argues, Buck is hit by the ferry. He jumps out of the water with a chopped face. Buck is taken away by the ferryman (Lloyd Berry) in a motorboat screaming they did it! A local policeman, Constable Porter (Tom Heaton), is angry at the kids for letting this prank get out of control and tells them to stay put on the island as he accompanies Buck to the local hospital.Muffy takes the group up to her house where she shows them the living and dining room areas and shows them their quarters to spend the night. That evening, the group sits around the dinner table as Skip, still upset over what happened to Buck, stays outside and drinks. Muffy, with a smirk on her face, invites everyone for dinner as Nan sits on a whoopee cushion, and Arch leans back in a breakaway chair. They talk over what they will do after graduation in which Muffy tells them about her inheriting her father's house and talks about turning it into a country inn. They drink to a toast as Muffy's smirk gives away another gag she sets up as everyone spills champagne on themselves from the trick drippy glasses as Muffy laughs.They retire to their rooms for the night as they encounter more gags left behind my Muffy, which includes a trick cigar that blows up when Hal lights it; spurting water faucets, and trick lights that don't turn off. Hal finds snipped newspaper articles about people dying in a fog and a fire, which he apparently was involved in some years back. Arch finds a drug paraphernalia in his bathroom cabinet which he is disturbed by over his past as a junkie. Nikki finds a studded collar with a chain in which her reaction gives away her interest in S&M and bondage. Nan comes out of the shower when she hears a baby cry, and she finds a tape recorder playing in her drawer which makes her upset. Outside, a drunken Skip enters the boathouse near the dock when he is grabbed by someone.The next day, Kit and Rob find Muffy in the kitchen cooking breakfast with her hair astray and acting strange. The group enjoys hanging around the back yard, while Nan tries to chase down Muffy. Rob is still upset about his own discovery in his and Kit's bedroom where his counselor informed her that he was not serious enough to get into medical school. He and Kit go to the boathouse to kiss when Kit sees Skip float by and the two of them run to tell the others. Chaz finds Skip's broken and bloody trick switchblade, but no trace of Skip's body. Arch suggests that it is Buck who has returned to seek his revenge for his being maimed the previous day.Meanwhile, Nan catches up to Muffy and angrily tells her about finding the cassette-tape joke, and Muffy claims not to know what Nan is talking about. Nan tells Muffy that she had an abortion some years back and kept it quiet between them.In the woods, as Arch is running through to the house, he gets caught in a trap when he is hung upside down by a snare, while a snake is on the ground trying to bite him. An unseen person appears, kicks away the snake, and stands over Arch who screams. On the same path a few minutes later, no one can find Arch. Rob tries to call the police on the house phone, but is unable to get through.When the water faucets in the house turn off, Hal and Nikki go to the nearby well. Hal accidentally drops the bucket into the well and does not want to go down to retrieve it. Nikki climbs down into the well when a rung breaks, making her fall into the water. As Hal climbs down to help her, Nikki finds the severed head of Arch, as well as Nan's dead body in the well.That evening back at the house, Constable Porter calls and says that he is at the hospital with Buck and tells them that he is coming to the island with an important thing to tell them and he will send a flare up at the dock when he arrives. Aware that there is a killer out there, the group goes around locking all the doors and windows of the house. In the study, Kit finds an old photograph of twins. Nikki says that Muffy has been acting strange all day and looks different from a pasty white face to her Catholic Girls School clothing as well as mentions the clodhopper nurse shoes that she also is wearing. Hal mentions that he heard Muffy and Nan arguing earlier about something in Nan's room, referencing an abortion that Nan was rumored to have gotten. They talk about the things found in their rooms when Muffy enters and says that she is going to bed. Chaz and Nikki go upstairs to their room as Rob heads up to the attic to keep an eye out for the constable. Kit goes off with Rob while Hal stays to watch the rooms downstairs.As Nikki packs her bags to leave, Chaz tries to calm her down by putting on a leather mask. Annoyed, Nikki pushes him to the bed and leaves the room. Nikki returns to see Chaz lying still on her bed. He does not respond to her and when she moves his hands away from his crotch, she sees blood. She is approached by someone standing behind the door.In the attic, Rob tells Kit that no one is to be left alone with Muffy for he does not trust her. They find a collection of dolls, apparently representing dead people, and a red flare goes off in the distance outside. They run out of the attic and call to everyone, but cannot find the others. The two enter Nikki and Chaz room only to find a bloody room, but no bodies. Kit runs into Muffy's room and finds Hal dead after being tied up and hung.In a panic, Kit and Rob run outside and to the dock where they pull in a motorboat, but no one is on board. They find a letter on the boat addressed to Constable Potter which talks of Miss St. John, a dangerous mental patient who escaped several days ago from a clinic. Kit says it can't be Muffy for she was with her at Vassar all that time. They try to start up the boat to leave, but the keys are gone having been taken by Constable Potter who has gone off. Rob says that there are a spare set of keys to the boat in the house and the two of them return to find the house totally dark with all the doors and windows closed, and the shades pulled down. They enter through a cellar window where they see a bloody trail and find Muffy's clothes from the night before in the basement fireplace. Height measurements are found on one of the basement walls for 'Muffy' and 'Buffy'. Kit recalling the photo of the twins, says that it must be Muffy's twin sister, Buffy, who has been doing all the killing.Kit and Rob see eyes looking at them from behind a painting and, after pulling it away, discover Muffy's severed head. They run up to the kitchen to find the keys for the boat when Muffy/Buffy appears at the back door armed with a large breaking knife, trying to get inside. Buffy forces the door open and pushes Rob into a closet and locks it and goes after Kit, who runs into the dining room and tries to reason with the pasty-faced, wild-eyed Buffy who does not respond and terrorizes her with the breaking knife. Kit pushes Buffy back when she tries to stab her and runs into the adjacent living room to find all of the dead people, alive and well, sitting around the room. Buffy walks in and.... pushes the fake blade of the breaking knife into her hand as she everyone else looks up at Kit and yell... APRIL FOOLS!!!!!!Buck appears in the closet with Rob, pulls off his prosthetic injury, and slaps it on Rob's face and unlocks the closet door for him. Rob runs out and into the living room where everyone laughs some more. Kit and Rob are relived, but not amused at this giant practical joke on them. Muffy thanks all of them for participating and helping out. She tells everyone about her idea about making the house into a country inn, but having a special type of whodunit weekend where guests are to figure out a simulated mystery and she wanted a rehearsal. Once a person was killed they were let in on the joke, with Rob and Kit being the last ones left and the winners who figured it all out. Muffy explains that her twin sibling is actually her cousin Skip, Constable Potter is actually her wealthy uncle, and Buck is a make-up artist who constructed all the severed heads and fake bodies. Even the ferryman was in on the whole thing as well. Muffy apologies for some of the more personal jokes, and the group drinks from dozens of bottles of champagne that Muffy brings out and they all have a happy good time.Later that night, a very inebriated Muffy returns to her bedroom for the night when she finds a package on her bed and upon opening it up finds a jack-in-the-box. As Muffy warily beings turning it to open, the jack jumps out when suddenly Nan jumps out behind the bed, grabs Muffy by the hair, gorily slices her throat, and Muffy screams. Nan smiles and shows Muffy the fake knife with the fake blood spraying from it, as a final back-at-you joke. April Fools says Nan to Muffy, as the jack-in-the-box winks at the viewers.

title: Payback: Straight Up
synopsis: (Note: this is the original 'Director's Cut' of the crime film, originally filmed in 1997).A on-screen text come up with reads the definition of 'principle'; ones own rule or code of conduct or devotion to such code.Porter (Mel Gibson) is seen walking across the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan, but he's not feeling groovy. He is crossing his own private Rubicon. Porter steals some cash from a beggar's hat. The beggar, who had been loudly describing himself as a cripple, leaps up, only to be restrained by Porter. In a coffee shop, Porter uses his stolen cash to buy himself a cup of coffee and a small sandwich. He asks for a cigarette from the waitress at the counter, and then steals the packet of cigarettes from the waitress after paying the bill. On the street again, he picks a pocket of a wealthy businessman, taking a wallet. In a restroom, he examines the ID photo of the guy he robbed. The man in the photo is smiling. Porter tries to mimic the smile but it's a struggle; he hasn't had a lot to smile about lately. He withdraws a few hundred dollars in cash at a bank using the debit card, he buys a new suit for himself on credit using the stolen credit card. Next, Porter uses the credit card to purchase three gold wristwatches, which he pawns for a large .44 Magnum revolver and $500 in cash. That evening, he eats a meal in a fancy restaurant. When it comes time to pay the bill, a waiter tells Porter that the credit card has bounced; its been cancelled, but Porter bluffs his way through and leaves without paying the bill despite the large amount of cash he has on him in $100 notes.That night, Porter waits outside an apartment rowhouse. An inebriated woman arrives, a willowy blonde named Lynn Porter (Deborah Kara Unger). Porter follows her inside and kicks in her apartment door. After looking around and finding no one else in the apartment, Porter stands over the stoned Lynn. She looks up and recognizes him.Porter and Lynn have some coffee at the kitchen table when he sees her arm which shows obvious heroin injection marks. As she pulls her arm away he furiously gets up and hits her in the head really hard. He then pushes the table aside as she grabs a knife to attack him. He fends her off and pushes her against the fridge before he slams her to the ground, headlocks her and shows her a picture of Rosie and him before their marriage. As the situation calms down, Lynn asks him what he's gonna do now. He wants his money back but realizes she meant what is he gonna do with her. He then asks her about Val before they talk about Rosie and what relation Porter had with her.He picks her up and puts her on the bed. Porter spots her heroin stash. She grabs it. He takes it away from her. He locks the door to her bedroom, then takes a shower. Alone in her bedroom, Lynn goes to her walk-in closet where it's revealed that she has a secret dope stash.Porter sleeps on the couch in the living room. Next morning, he wakes up and checks up on her in the bedroom. Lynn is dead from a heroin overdose. He pulls the needle out of her arm and stabs the syringe into the wall. It has his wedding ring hanging on it. He lies down on the bed next to her dead body.In a flashback sequence five or six months earlier, Porter speaks to someone called Val (Gregg Henry) on the phone. They're planning something. On the street, Val explains the target. Some Chinese gangsters have a set routine, servicing a Chinese money laundry. How much do you need, Val? says Porter. How much does do you need to buy your way back into a crime organization called the Outfit? Val replies, $130,000.
The Chinese gangsters drive past, up an alley. Porter observes them, then decides their program: You notice anything about those guys? They weren't wearing their seat belts. We'll hit 'em on Friday.On Friday, Porter drives flat out, down the same alley, but in the opposite direction. There is a head-on smash. Porter spits out a gumshield and cuts free the bag of money. Val demonstrates that he is a sadist; he beats up an unconscious gangster for the fun of it. Porter's wife, Lynn, arrives in another car. The three depart together.Inside an empty warehouse, they count the money which adds up to $140,000 in cash, which means a 50-50 split to $70,000... not enough for Val. Porter says, We got away clean. Always be grateful for what you get. Rule Number One, Val. There are signs of tension, mistrust. Val says, This is funny. This'll kill ya. It's always $140 grand. Suddenly Porter's wife pulls a gun and shoots Porter twice in the back. Val explains to Porter: Lynn did not understand. He shows him a photo of Porter and some other woman, very friendly. Wives get funny when it comes to girlfriends. As a farewell, he kicks Porter in the head, then gets in the car and they drive away with all the money for himself.In the present day, Porter is lying on the bed next to his dead wife. There is a knock at the door. A punk delivery boy is outside. Porter drags him inside, searches him, and finds heroin. The kid has a smart mouth. Porter rips out a nose ring. He asks the punk where he got the drugs, but the kid worries about them. Porter says, Worry about me! The kid provides a name: Arthur Stegman, and an address. Porter says, Thanks. Porter lets the punk kid go.Porter climbs the steps to a rundown, upstairs office. A large black man is reading a newspaper behind the front counter. Porter asks for Arthur Stegman. The black guy says he's not there. Porter persists. He at home? The black guy suggests he go fuck himself.Meanwhile, Stegman (David Paymer) is playing craps with two plain clothes cops named Detective Hicks (Bill Duke) and Detective Leary (Jack Conley) in the back room. The door opens, and the large black guy enters, holding his head after apparently being punched by Porter. (There's somebody here to see you.) Porter is behind him where he says: I'm looking for Stegman. Your boy didn't make his delivery. Porter throws the heroin on the table. The cops are surprised, but not troubled, to discover Stegman is a drug dealer. Stegman and Porter go outside.On the street, Porter asks where Val Resnick is. Stegman claims: He's in the city, that's all I know. He said he squared himself with the Syndicate. That he was back in the big time. Porter says: Well you tell him Porter is back too, and he wants his money.An Asian woman dominatrix named Pearl (Lucy Liu), arrives at the Oakwood Arms Hotel. A phone rings in a room. Val Resnick answers and tells the desk clerk to send her up to his room. The woman is directed to a hotel room. Val's phone rings again. (Send her up. What's the problem?) But it's someone else, with news about Stegman. Pearl arrives at the door. They have a sado-masochistic exchange with both of them punching each other in their faces. The voice on the phone tells Val about Stegman getting a visit from some heavy. Resnick arranges a meeting.Val Resnick arrives by taxi at a crappy looking restaurant to meet Stegman who tells him about his visit with Porter. Val asks about the guy. What'd he say? asks Val. I just got the feeling he'd like to kill you, that's all, says Stegman. Resnick is rattled. He makes a threatening move against another customer. Stegman smoothes things over and they leave.Inside a bar at the Regal Hotel, Porter is looking for Michael, who turns out to be a young but smarmy bartender. Porter asks about a woman named Rosie and offers him bribe money by laying out a $100 bill on the counter. But the trashy Michael implies that he wants more money by saying: Usually these matters are conducted with more discretion. Porter angrily slams a door on his fingers, injuring Michael's hand. Be discreet now, says Porter. Michael rings Rosie. Porter snatches the phone from Michael and takes over the call. Who's this? Rosie asks. Porter. Try again, honey. Porter's dead, says Rosie. Porter replies: I used to drive for you. Provide a safe work environment. Porter? says Rosie. Porter leaves, but neverless leaves behind the bribe money for the injured Michael who is tending to his wounded hand.Porter arrives at another hotel and knocks on a front door. Rosie (Maria Bello) opens the door. (She is the same woman in the photo that Val showed Porter after betraying him months earlier). In contrast to his wife's reaction, she runs to Porter; embraces him. (Come on, come in. You look pretty good for a dead guy.) They talk. She learns his wife is dead. (I'm sorry, Porter. Why? Surly Porter. You're the same as ever.) She walks into the lounge, where there is a large guard dog. What's his name? Porter asks. Porter. He took your job after you left. He's just as tough, but he won't leave me. says Rosie. Porter says he's looking for Val Resnick. She knows him. She tells Porter that he is a top lieutenant with The Outfit, a local crime syndicate. (He beats up all the girls. He almost killed one.) Even you? asks Porter. Does it matter? You quit looking after me says Rosie. She gives him Val's address. Before Porter leaves Rosie's apartment, she tells him that he never even asked how she's been. He asks her if she needs money or something. She gets angry and throws a little statue at him but he easily catches it. As he turns around she tells him that he should go and get himself killed because she has to tell the Outfit that he's coming.It's night in Resnick's room. He is asleep in bed with Pearl. Resnick wakes to find Porter looking at him. Hi, Val. Where's my money? says Porter. Val reaches for his gun, but Porter's already got it. My seventy grand. I want it. Resnick tells him that he gave it all to the Syndicate as a bribe to be let back into their organization. Tomorrow. Noon. You and the money be at the corner of 7th and Franklin at the payphone, Porter says before leaving. Porter asks Val about the photo with him and Rosie and how Val acquired it. Some hooker had it. I recognized you. I swiped it in case I could use it, says Resnick. Did you hurt her? asks Porter. What does that have to do with anything? asks Resnick. Porter knocks him unconscious, then goes to leave. Pearl seductively says: I've got a few minutes. Porter replies, So? Go boil an egg.The next morning, Val Resnick arrives at a large office building where he asks to see Mr. Carter. Val is allowed to enter Carter's office only after one of the bodyguards frisks him. The man finds three guns. Val is pissed off and poses as more important than he actually is. The bodyguard knows that.Val is sitting in the spacious office in front of Carter (William Devane), a mob underboss of the Syndicate. The uneasy Val tells Carter about his ex-partner-in-crime Porter and Val wants him dead. Phillip says you have a problem you need help with. Carter tells Val that they can help him, or he can help himself deal with Porter, or that Val can be replaced. Since Carter sees Val as a psychotic sadist and a valuable asset to the Outfit he will help him deal with Porter. However, Carter tells Val to move out of the Oakwood Arms Hotel until Porter is dealt with.Outside the office building, Val runs into two men (presumably bodyguards). He says Carter loves him and will never drop him from the Outfit. He pretends that this won't keep him awake at night. Unfortunately both bodyguards received a call from the outfit prior to Val's arrival. They both say goodbye, smiling. Val is on his own. Suddenly he yells at them lone warrior style, claiming they are both useless since Porter sneaked by them the night before and entered his room. Then he yells to the sky that if something needs to be done right you gotta do it yourself. That's the American way says Val.Val then walks to a payphone can calls Pearl. He asks her if her friends arrived already. He first tells her that the Outfit won't hep him. She puts the phone aside and walks to a guy in the background whose tongue is stuck in a mouse trap and who won't stop screaming because of that. She punches him several times, yelling that he should shut up because she's on the phone. Pearl who is apparently connected with the Chinese Triad gangsters that Val Resnick and Porter ripped off.It's 12:00 PM. Val Resnick is standing in the street. Porter starts walking toward him. A car comes hurtling around a corner and knocks Porter down. Pearl and four Chinese gangsters get out and slap him around. Then the two corrupt cops, Hicks and Leary arrive forcing Pearl and her posse of Chinese thugs to leave. The two dirty cops stand up Porter to his feet and one of them says, Stegman says you've got a line on a load of cash, Porter. 250 grand to be exact. The cops push him around. (We've got a dead girl full of heroin. Don't worry, Porter. We're going to give you immunity. All you gotta do is get the money. Oh, we can't help you, though. It'd be against the law.) They slap him around some more and leave him in the alley. Porter has one of the cop's badges; he picked his pocket while they were shoving him around.A wounded and bruised Porter arrives at Rosie's apartment building. Resnick pulls up in a taxi (he's been following Porter), and watches him go inside. Rosie applies first aid to Porter. She gets angry and starts to walk away, but when she spots the photo of her and Porter together, she returns and asks: When did you decide to leave? Was it the night we slept together? No. It was the next day when I had to drive you to work. You could've asked me to quit. You could've asked me to drive you somewhere else, says Porter. Porter puts on a clean shirt. Rosie says, I think all the stories about you being dead were true, You're just too thick-headed to admit it. Porter and Rosie kiss. He leaves. She doesn't want him to. He says he has to.There is a knock at the door. Rosie thinks it's Porter. Instead, it's Resnick. Where is he? Porter? asks Val. He's in the bedroom. says Rosie. Resnick grabs her by the hair and forces her to walk in front of him. He walks into the darkened bedroom. As Val goes to shoot Porter in the bed, the dog leaps out. He shoots the dog dead. Rosie tries to hit Resnick, but. misses. He knocks her down. Where is he? Val asks. He's gone. Rosie says. I know you. You're that whore from the picture. I'm going to fuck you six ways from Sunday! says Val. When Val asks Rosie how she knows Porter, she tells him that Porter used to work as a driver for a limo service and he used to drive her to various jobs while she worked as an escort and call girl for the Syndicate. Porter saved her from various johns that would rough up women.The door bursts open. Porter enters, gun in hand, and shoots Val in the shoulder. Val goes for his ankle holster, and Porter shoots him in the leg. Porter says to Rosie: I forgot my cigarettes. All right, Val. This Syndicate or Outfit or whatever you call it, it's got a head man, right?, ask Porter.They'll kill me if I tell you anything, Porter, Resnick says.Worry about me! says Porter.Resnick caves in and replies: Fairfax and Carter. They run the whole city.Where do I find them? asks Porter.Resnick gives the address to Carter's office, then tries his I'll-be-your-friend routine. Porter shoots him dead. Rosie is shocked. Porter lights a cigarette and says: Rosie, gather up everything you need. Say goodbye to this place.Porter walks round a corner at night. Opens a newspaper dispensing box, hides his gun under some newspapers. The two corrupt cops, Hicks and Leary, arrive in a car. Porter thinks again, retrieves the gun, hides it behind a newspaper. What's up, buddy? asks Hicks. Well the money's in there, if you're still interested. says Porter. Stegman is in the back seat. Porter says,You guys do me a favor? They'll probably frisk me when I go in there. He pulls out the gun. If you wouldn't mind holding onto this, just for a little while. One of the cops plays with the gun. Porter leaves, walks into an impressive looking office tower building.A hood walks into an outer office and asks Porter: Can I help you? I want to see Mr. Carter. says Porter. Turn around so I can frisk you. says the thug. He frisks. A door opens on an inside office. Porter walks in. Carter sits at a desk, a heavy stands on one side, the other hood follows him in. Porter drops the two hoods; two punches, one kick to the head. Picks up a gun. Looks around.Carter says, Bravo, sit down. Porter sits. There's something you want from me? says Carter. Porter explains all about Val and about the $70,000 which he gave to them as a part of his $130,000 bribe to be let back into the Syndicate, and Porter now wants the Syndicate to compensate him for the money of his share that Val stole from their robbery job.No corporation in the world would agree to what you're asking, says Carter.What about Fairfax, will he give me my money? asks Porter.We're not authorized to do things like this, says Carter.Who is? Porter asks.Carter replies that his superior and the leader of the Outfit: Bronson. Carter then places a phone call where an tough-talking unseen woman known as Ms. Bronson (voice of Sally Kellerman) answers the phone. Carter says: I have a problem. There's a man in my office with a gun, who says he's going to kill me if we don't pay him $130,000 that one of our lieutenants stole from him. Porter tries to explain that it's actually $70,000, half from a $140,000 job that he and Val Resnick pulled off. However, Ms. Bronson is clearly reluctant to negotiate with Porter.Porter becomes frustrated by her stalling tactic and yells: Either I get my money or I kill Carter! My money. Yes or no?, asks Porter.No! says Ms. Bronson. BANG.Carter falls from his chair... dead. In his final breath, Carter insults Porter, where Ms. Bronson voices, I hope that insult wasn't for me. She is heard ordering unseen men to the building complex and calls out for Carter who is now dead. Porter yells over the phone: Call Fairfax and tell him I just croaked Carter. And he's next, and then you unless I get my money! After hanging up the phone, Porter picks up an address book off the desk, turns to Fairfax's address.Porter walks back out onto the street. The two dirty cops are waiting in the parked car. Porter is still carrying the newspaper. I don't see any cash, one says. They gave me the runaround. I have to go see another guy. Can I have my piece back? asks Porter. Hicks empties the bullets from the gun and hands it back. Porter accepts it inside the newspaper. Porter walks away.Inside Rosie's apartment, Val Resnick lies dead on the floor. Porter walks in, opens his newspaper and slides the gun with the two cops fingerprints on it next to the body. Then he takes out the cop badge he lifted earlier, wipes off his prints and places it in the dead guy's hand.The next morning, a limo pulls up outside an expensive town house. The second mob underboss Fairfax (James Coburn) gets out. Two bodyguards carry Fairfax's suitcases inside. Stegman and the black guy sit in a taxi, watching. (Porter and Fairfax. I bet that'll be a short conversation.) Stegman looks at a parked car in a side alley. (Between us and our neighborhood cops, I'd say we got him pretty well covered.)Inside the house, a guy is slumped against the wall. Fairfax walks into a very expensively furnished room. Porter emerges from behind a pillar, gun in hand. (I'm the reason you're home early, Mr Fairfax. I want you to do me a favor. Call Bronson.) Fairfax picks up the phone and rings. Hello. Ms. Bronson... well it's like this. I'm standing in my living room. There's a man here named Porter. He says that he expects you to pay him, sooner or later, says Fairfax. To Porter: He wants to talk to you. Put it on the speaker.Ms. Bronson however says that she should have Porter kill Fairfax so Porter can run the the business in town all for over $130,000.Porter replies, You people aren't listening. 
It's not 130... But the angry Ms. Bronson cuts him off by saying, No, you listen! You'll get your money, but you'll never live to enjoy it. Porter says: You let me worry about that. When one of Fairfax's bodyguards lowers the suitcase he is carrying, Porter shoots at it. Ms. Bronson hears the gunshot and calls out for Fairfax. She apparently decides to give up and asks Porter where does he want his money. Porter tells her to send a single man to Kings Cross Station in two hours from now. Ms. Bronson tells Porter that the transfer will result in Porter's death.After Porter hangs up, Fairfax tells him, You just signed your own death warrant for $130,000! Porter leaves and tells Fairfax to tell Ms. Bronson that the money he wants is only $70,000. Fairfax is surprised and shouts as Porter exits: Seventy? Only seventy thousand? Hell, all my suits together are worth more then that!Meanwhile, the two crooked cops sit in a parked car in an alley. Leary is reading the paper and looking over an ad for a sailboat, while Hicks is discussing the latest horse racing form and of them putting more bets and hope to make up for their $150,000 losses of betting. Suddenly, two guys in black suits walk up. They are from the police department's Internal Affairs Bureau. You wanna step out of the car, please? one of the IAB agents asks.Stegman and the black guy, watching, as cops in uniform walk with the Internal Affairs agents up to the car.What the hell is going on? Detective Hicks asks.Is this your badge, detective? as the IAB agent shows them in an evidence bag.Where'd you find it? asks Leary.Where exactly did you lose it? asks the IAB agent who shows him Porter's gun in a plastic bag. Does this belong to you? asks the agent. The two dirty cops realize, way too late, that Porter has framed them.As Hicks and Leary are being led away by the police, Porter walks out of Fairfax's house. Stegman sees him and he tells the black guy, Follow him.Porter is crossing the street. A taxi comes round the corner. Porter hails, opens the door and Stegman is in the back seat holding a gun. Get in, Porter! he says. Porter gets in and drops his gun on the floor. As Stegman gloats, Porter snatches Stegman's gun out of his hand. Porter bangs Stegman's head against the door. The black guy pulls out a shotgun. Suddenly, a van pulls up alongside containing four Chinese gangsters, plus Pearl, all of whom open fire with automatic weapons. In the wall of gunfire, Porter uses Stegman as a shield who gets killed as does the black guy. Porter crawls out of the car and opens fire on the Chinese gangsters, killing two of them. Pearl and her henchmen return fire. The driver puts the van in reverse, and slams Porter into a crate of boxes. Porter slides under the van and shoots through the floor, killing all of the surviving Chinese gangsters. When he climbs back up, Pearl appears outside the van and puts a gun against his head and immediately pulls the trigger... but she's out of bullets. Porter aims his gun at her and pulls the trigger... and he is also out of bullets. Porter then walks away and and gets into a refridgerated truck parked right next to the car and drive away, leaving Pearl behind.At Kings Cross Station, Porter arrives in the stolen truck and sees that all around the area are Ms. Bronson's henchmen. He first decides that all the henchmen of the Outfit must be disposed. Rosie, in the refridgerated truck, distracts two men in the car by the stair ramp to the station while Porter sneaks up on them and forces them at gunpoint to get in the back of the truck. They lock them in there. When one of the guys grins and tells Rosie that he believes he slept with her once, she takes the safety off her gun, aims at his crotch and asks him how his chances are on doing that ever again. The guy falls silent. After, Rosie leaves the truck, Porter shoots the guy in cold blood for the stupid remark. The other guy gets locked in the truck with the body and thanks Porter for allowing him to live.Porter enters the station, approaches another guy and asks who else is with Bronson before he knocks him out. On the men's restroom he takes the urinal between Bronson's men. As they draw their guns Porter shoots and kills them both.On the platform, two more men of Bronson wait for Porter. He takes them by surprise and forces them on-board of the arriving train.He then waits for the courier. He frisks a suspicious guy who turns out to be a regular businessman. He the spots the courier who's carrying a backpack with the money. The young man asks if he is Porter and tells him that the 130 grand is in the backpack. Porter angrily tells the young guy that it was 70 grand, NOT 130 grand and thus too much. He tells the courier to place the backpack on the ground. Porter wants him to open it. As he bends down, a woman wearing a business suit with white sneakers (another one of Ms. Bronson's henchpersons), suddenly appears behind the courier, draws a gun and shoots at Porter. She hits him in his waist and he goes down. The female gangster also shoots at the courier who is also hit. As the courier falls over to the side, Porter returns fire and shoots the hitwoman. She falls down on the platform, dead. Porter struggles himself up, kills the still breathing courier and leaves the platform, badly wounded and bleeding.Outside the station, three more men of the Outfit are waiting in a car and the same bodyguard Porter knocked out with the roll of coins earlier at Carter's office gets out and starts shooting at Porter. Porter takes another hit but manages to kill the guy. The two others flee in the car and Porter goes down. Porter staggers to the sidewalk, bends his knees and sits down at a parking meter.In a voice over we hear Rosie, Val and the others talk to him while he lights a cigarette and we see black and white flashbacks of earlier scenes of the movie flashing briefly. The flashbacks start to overlap with Rosie's arrival who tries to wake Porter up. He, however, seems to think about going into the white light. After she shakes him and hits him, he slowly wakes up. They drive off with the cash as Porter smiles.

title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame
synopsis: On a street in Paris, during the Middle Ages, a Gypsy named Clopin performs puppet shows for children. Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had done--as much as if the statues of the cathedral itself were alive and aware of what they just witnessed. Being fearful for his salvation, Claude Frollo asked what he needed to do, and the Archdeacon told him to raise the child as if he were his own. He reluctantly agreed, but only on the condition that the child lived up in the bell-towers of Notre Dame, away from public view. He wondered to himself if the child might be of use to him in the future.Clopin reveals the child's name given by Frollo: Quasimodo, signifying in Latin half-formed [not a literal translation]. (Sometimes he's called Quasi for short.) He concludes his tale about a man and a monster by saying,  'Now here is a riddle to guess if you can,' sing the bells of Notre Dame. 'Who is the monster, and who is the man?' Meanwhile, the now adult Quasimodo walks out onto a balcony at the base of the bell-towers of Notre Dame, and he is shown to be severely deformed, the most prominent feature being his hunched back. After a brief moment where he helps a young bird learn to fly, he envies the bird and goes back in to his home inside one of the bell-towers. It is filled with old statues; a stained-glass mobile; and wooden models (made by Quasi) of the Notre Dame Cathedral, houses, and various citizens of Paris. He speaks with three stone gargoyles named Victor, Hugo, and LaVerne [who are presumed to be real and alive in this synopsis; it can be argued that they are part of Quasi's imagination, but there are certain scenes which imply they are more than that, as well as scenes in the Direct-to-Video sequel]. He laments that Frollo will not allow him to attend the Festival (or Feast) of Fools later that day, or even leave the bell towers on any other day, but the gargoyles convince him to go out in disguise.Before he can enact his plan, Frollo arrives with Quasi's lunch, and the gargoyles revert to inanimate stone (they only come alive when Quasi's alone). While going over his alphabet lessons, Quasimodo accidentally reveals his desire to attend the festival. Frollo insists that the Festival of Fools is an affront to everything good, and that he himself only goes because of his duties as a public official. He lies to Quasi, reminding him how his Gypsy mother supposedly abandoned him as a baby, and Frollo was the only one who took him in. [Ironically, that's what happened in the book.] Using these lies, he describes the world as far too harsh and cruel for someone like Quasimodo, and that the cathedral is his only sanctuary. However, in spite of his warnings, Quasi still decides to attend in secret--reasoning that to spend just one day out among everyone else would be worth it.Elsewhere in the city, a newly arrived man named Phoebus (along with his horse, Achilles) search in vain for the Palace of Justice. He comes across some performing Gypsies, including the beautiful dancer Esmeralda. They catch each others eye, but before they can speak some city guards come along on patrol. The other Gypsies manage to get away, but Esmeralda gets caught and harassed--accused of stealing the money given by passers-by for their performances. As she struggles to break free, her goat Djali (pronounced like jolly) loosens their grips with a few well-placed kicks and headbutts. Phoebus then uses Achilles to keep the guards from pursuing, much to the onlookers' (and Esmeralda's) amusement. Before they can retaliate, Phoebus reveals himself to be the new Captain of the Guard and orders them to take him to the Palace of Justice. Esmeralda watches him from hiding, clearly interested in and intrigued by him.Upon arriving at the Palace, Phoebus meets Minister Frollo in the dungeon (where the former Captain of the Guard is being whipped off-screen, much to Phoebus' discomfort). They go out to a balcony where Frollo tasks Phoebus with the top priority of rooting out the Gypsies by finding and destroying their safe haven, which they call the Court of Miracles. Phoebus appears to be skeptical about the whole thing, and probably about Frollo in general, but he mostly keeps his concerns to himself. Hearing the music for the Feast of Fools begin in the distance, they leave to attend.From the start of the Feast of Fools, Quasimodo (disguised with a cloak) is like a fish out of water, thanks in no small part to Clopin's antics. During the chaos and commotion, he accidentally stumbles into Esmeralda's tent while she's changing for a dance. She checks to see if he's alright, and he tries in vain to hide his face. However, to his surprise, she isn't phased at all when she sees it. She sends him on his way, and ends by saying, By the way, great mask! Quasimodo smiles at the irony.Frollo, Phoebus, and the guards arrive at the festival soon afterward, just in time for Esmeralda's dance. She appears on the stage wearing a revealing red silk dress instead of her normal attire. Frollo, Phoebus, and Quasimodo (and basically everybody else) are all captivated by her--though Frollo hides this by voicing his disgust to Phoebus. However, when she approaches him playfully as part of her act, he is speechless. She also notices Quasi during her performance and acknowledges him with a wink, which embarrasses him. The crowd goes wild as she concludes her dance in a glamorous fashion.Clopin announces the next item on the agenda, which comes in stark contrast to Esmeralda: They are to crown the King of Fools, an award to the one who can make the ugliest face in Paris. The contestants go up on stage wearing masks, and then make a face when the mask is removed. Esmeralda innocently invites Quasimodo up on the stage to take part. After all the other contestants are booed (and booted off the stage by Djali), Esmeralda tries to take off Quasi's mask. She is shocked and frightened when she discovers he wears no mask. The townspeople are horrified, and one of them realizes he must be the infamous bell-ringer of Notre Dame (he being a Boo-Radley-esque urban legend among them). Frollo hadn't noticed Quasi on the stage up to this point, but he is shocked and disappointed once he does.Quasi starts to hide his face and cry, but Clopin asks the crowd not to panic. He points out that they all asked for the ugliest face in Paris, and surely he fits the bill perfectly. Quickly the crowd goes from repulsion to celebration. As they carry him to a platform in front of the cathedral, Quasi waves sheepishly to Frollo, who scowls in response. He's given a jester's crown, as well as a robe and scepter. They begin chanting his name, and he celebrates along with them.Unfortunately, one of the guards who harassed Esmeralda earlier hits Quasimodo in the face with a tomato. Other guards quickly follow suit. Though the rest of the crowd is shocked at first, they soon see the cruel humor of the situation, so they turn on Quasi. When he tries to get away, people begin to lasso him down. With strength born from years of ringing the enormous bells, Quasimodo pulls many of the ropes off, but he is ultimately overpowered and tied to a wheel on the platform. After tying him, the men give the wheel a vigorous turn, and the crowd continues to pelt him with produce. He calls out to Frollo for help, but it's in vain; when Phoebus asks permission to stop the cruelty, Frollo tells him, In a moment, Captain. A lesson needs to be learned here.However, the shouting and throwing immediately stops when Esmeralda begins to climb the stairs up the platform; she went back to her tent after her last interaction with Quasi in order to change back into her normal clothes, but she quickly returned afterward once she saw what was happening. She approaches slowly, almost hesitantly, and looks at Quasi with pity and sorrow. She asks him not to be afraid as she approaches and wipes the tomato juice from his face, saying, I'm sorry... This wasn't supposed to happen.Frollo orders her to come down, and she replies she will once she frees Quasi from the ropes. When he forbids her, she cuts them anyway defiantly. She calls him out on his wicked behavior and hypocrisy, saying, You mistreat this poor boy the same way you mistreat my people! You speak of 'justice,' yet you are cruel to those most in need of your help! The crowd stares in awe at her standing up to Frollo. He tells her she'll regret her actions. She, in turn, says he should have been the one crowned King of Fools. Frollo orders Phoebus to arrest her. When he sends his guards for her, however, she manages to evade capture and hide through quick wits, acrobatics, smoke and mirrors trickery (which Frollo assumed to be witchcraft), and the favor of the crowd. Frollo is furious, and Phoebus is infatuated. Nevertheless, the guards continue their search.Meanwhile, Frollo approaches Quasimodo, and with only a look expresses his anger and disappointment with him; saying I told you so isn't necessary. Quasi, in tears, replies, I'm sorry, Master. I will never disobey you again... He stumbles back to the Cathedral of Notre Dame through the fearful and murmuring crowd.Afterward, Esmeralda and Djali sneak into the cathedral disguised as a hunched old man in a hooded cloak (similar to Quasimodo's disguise earlier). Phoebus sees through the disguise, but doesn't alert anyone else; instead, he follows her inside. Despite his attempt to approach her quietly, she detects his presence behind her. She turns quickly, pulls his sword out of his sheath, and throws him to the floor. Soon afterward though he takes the sword back and knocks her down. She nearly swears at him (he stops her--pointing out they're in a church), picks up a large candelabrum, and proceeds to duel with him--accompanied with appropriate banter. He surprises her though when he makes it clear he has no desire or intention of arresting her. Instead, he gives her his name and asks for hers in return. She gives it, remarking that he's nothing like the other soldiers.However, before anything else can be said, Frollo and several of his guards enter; he thanks Phoebus for finding her, and orders him to arrest her. Esmeralda thinks Phoebus tricked her into staying in place for her to get caught. Instead, Phoebus tells Frollo that she claimed sanctuary, so he can't arrest her. Before Frollo can press the issue, the Archdeacon approaches and tells him to leave her be. He reminds Frollo in vague terms of the last time he violated the law of sanctuary, much to his anger. Frollo sends the guards out, but while the Archdeacon (and Djali) escorts Phoebus out, Frollo sneaks around the pillars and pins Esmeralda's arm behind her back. He threatens her, saying that he can out-wait her and that eventually she will have to exit the cathedral, and then she'll be his. During the course of this threat, it's made clear that he is aroused by Esmeralda--much to her disgust (and his, in a sense).After he leaves, she checks and sees that Frollo has guards posted at every door. The Archdeacon warns her not to do anything too rash, that for her safety it would be unwise to anger Frollo more. She justifies her actions by pointing out the injustice and mercilessness of the crowd who abused Quasimodo, and Frollo who let it happen; she had hoped that if one would stand up to Frollo, that this would give people courage to stand up together. Seeing her frustration, the Archdeacon tells her she cannot right all the wrongs in the world, but that even if no one else in the world would help her, perhaps there was someone else who would.Taking his words to heart, Esmeralda prays (through song) for God to help all the outcasts of the world. Quasimodo, who had retreated back up to the bell-tower, hears her praying and goes down to the main floor to watch her. He is touched by her prayer. However, one of the parishioners sees him and berates him, saying he's caused enough trouble today. He runs back up the staircase, but Esmeralda follows him, saying she wants to talk to him. The gargoyles see her following him, remarking that perhaps the day wasn't a total loss after all. They congratulate him, and thus detain him to allow Esmeralda to catch up. He makes excuses to continue to run, but as she follows him she apologizes for bringing him up on the stage--that had she known who he was, she would have never taken his privacy so callously. When she reaches his home in the tower though, she is silenced with awe by the things inside. She inspects the models of the city, remarking that if she could make things like them she wouldn't be dancing in the street for coins. He compliments her dancing though, which she accepts bashfully. When she recognizes the wood carvings of people as specific individuals in Paris, she says, You're a surprising person, Quasimodo.He offers to give her and Djali a tour of the rest of the tower; she accepts. He shows her the bells, which she enjoys (particularly Big Marie, the largest one). He then takes her up to the roof of the tower and shows her the sunset. She compliments the tower via hyperbole, saying I could stay up here forever. When Quasimodo points out she could mean that literally too, she declines--at least not as a prisoner. Through the course of their conversation, Esmeralda learns that Frollo raised him, and that he taught him misconceptions about Gypsies (that they were evil)--and about himself personally; he calls himself a monster. To help him see otherwise, she takes his hand and gives him a palm reading, during which she declares she could find no monster lines on his palm. She offers him to see hers and asks, Do you think I'm evil? When he declares it isn't so, she replies that perhaps Frollo is wrong about both of them.After a moment of silence, Quasimodo feels inspired to help Esmeralda escape her current predicament as payback for her kindness to him earlier. He proposes they climb down from the outside--with Quasi carrying Esmeralda while she holds Djali. She accepts, despite understandable nervousness. Though there are a few close calls, they manage to succeed. Before she leaves, she offers Quasimodo to come with her to the Court of Miracles. He declines, referring to his awful experience earlier--so she offers to come by the cathedral instead, in spite of the danger she would face. He objects, but she calms his fears with some simple yet powerful persuasion. As she leaves, she gives him a necklace with a woven pendant, saying it is the key to being able to find her if he ever needs sanctuary.When he climbs back up to the rooftop, he is approached by Phoebus, who asks if he knows where Esmeralda was. Quasimodo makes it known in no uncertain terms that he isn't welcome there, but Phoebus insists that he means her no harm. He asks Quasi to tell her that he's sorry he got her trapped in the cathedral, but that it was the only way to save her life. On his way out, Phoebus also asks him to tell her that she's lucky to have a friend like Quasi (which surprises him).The gargoyles congratulate Quasimodo on kicking Phoebus out for intruding and trying to steal [his] girl. Quasi is incredulous of their assertions that Esmeralda has any feelings for him other than friendship, reminding them that he has the ugliest face in all of Paris--saying, I don't think I'm her type. Yet he also wonders (through song) if it might possibly be true, describing the way she makes him feel as heaven's light and calling her an angel. As he muses, he makes a wood carving of her, and places it next to his own.Meanwhile in the Palace of Justice, Claude Frollo feels the opposite towards Esmeralda (and towards himself, though he is slow to admit it). He prays (also through song) about how in spite of his moral strength relative to others, he has fallen for Esmeralda, thus committing the sin of lust. He describes the way she makes him feel as hell fire and calls her a witch and a siren. As he stands before the fireplace, he imagines the flames and smoke taking her form in a seductive fashion. He blames everyone but himself for his feelings and sins. He asks, as punishment for her temptations, that she either be destroyed or be [his] and [his] alone. At this time one of the guards arrives and tells Frollo that Esmeralda has escaped the cathedral. Frollo sends him out and declares that he'll find her even if he has to burn Paris to the ground to do so. He directs his unholy prayer to Esmeralda, saying, Be mine or you will burn! He concludes, God have mercy on her... God have mercy on me.The next morning, though he is sleep deprived, he orders Phoebus and his men to assemble--giving them the order to find the Gypsy girl. He accompanies them and has them ransack Gypsy wagons and known hiding places--offering silver pieces to any Gypsy who would reveal Esmeralda's location. Nobody accepts the offer. As Frollo orders more and more Gypsies to be arrested, Phoebus' disgust and indignation grows. They eventually arrive at a mill on the outskirts of Paris, where Esmeralda has followed them in disguise (presumably to find out what exactly is going on). Inside, Frollo is interrogating the miller about a Gypsy talisman that was found on their property. (It is unclear whether this talisman was actually found there, or if this was a false accusation by Frollo.) The miller proclaims his innocence and ignorance on the matter, but Frollo tells him and his family that they will be under house arrest until they can verify the claim.However, when Frollo bars the door from the outside, he orders Phoebus to burn the mill--saying that they are traitors and need to be made examples. Phoebus protests, and when Frollo refuses to back down he extinguishes his torch in open insubordination. Fixed in his mind, Frollo lights the mill himself, which burns quickly. Phoebus jumps in through the window and kicks open the door from the inside, carrying the miller's infant and toddler, and leading him and his wife outside--just before the mill collapses. As the family runs for safety, Phoebus is struck in the back of the head by one of the guards. While he is held in place, Frollo sentences him to death on the spot, expressing sorrow for his wasted career. Phoebus retorts, Consider it my highest honor, sir.Before he is beheaded, Esmeralda saves his life with a well-aimed sling throw that hits Frollo's horse, making it buck. Phoebus uses the distraction to floor the guards, and he escapes on the horse. However, before he can get clear of Frollo's archers, he is struck between his cuirass and pauldron (or torso and shoulder armor) by an arrow. Being on a bridge as it happened, he falls off the horse and into the water below. Frollo and his troops catch up, and he orders them to simply let Phoebus rot in his watery grave and continue to search for Esmeralda. Meanwhile, Esmeralda herself sneaks under the bridge, and when the others move a safe distance away she dives into the river. She removes Phoebus' weighty armor and brings him to shore.As fires spread throughout Paris, Frollo puzzles over how Esmeralda could have possibly escaped the cathedral. When he hears the bells ringing, he realizes that only Quasimodo could have managed to get her out unnoticed. The perspective switches to Quasi, who worries about Esmeralda. Two of the gargoyles, Victor and Laverne, share his concerns--but Hugo expresses confidence that she's one step ahead of Frollo as usual; not only this, but he tells Quasi she'll be back for him once the city calms down--a sentiment the other two gargoyles agree upon. They say (through song) that Quasimodo is more unique than any other guy in the city, and that what he views as his flaws are actually the things that would endear him to Esmeralda. Quasi doubts she has feelings for him, but even he begins to believe their assurances.Coincidentally, Esmeralda enters the bell-tower at the end of the song. However, instead of coming just to see Quasimodo, she comes seeking shelter for Phoebus--Quasimodo being one of the only people she can trust to keep him safe outside of the Court of Miracles itself (if not the only person). She also needs to tend his wounds more thoroughly, which could only be done in a safe place. Quasi shows them to a relatively comfortable spot in the tower (probably where he sleeps). Esmeralda and Phoebus talk while Quasimodo watches and listens nearby. She disinfects his arrow-wound with wine and sews it shut, and he expresses his discomfort with witty remarks. She reveals her admiration at his bravery and compassion, saying he was lucky the arrow didn't pierce his heart. He puts his hands over hers and says, I'm not so sure it didn't. As they look into each others' eyes and see their mutual feelings, they kiss. They don't notice Quasimodo hiding his weeping face while his heart breaks.Immediately afterward, Djali warns them about Frollo, whose carriage just arrived in front of the cathedral. Quasi tells them the way to go to avoid Frollo. Esmeralda tells him to be careful, and asks him to promise not to let anything happen to Phoebus. He promises, in spite of his feelings. He hides Phoebus (who fell asleep from exhaustion) under the table when they leave, finishing up just as Frollo walks in. Frollo acts relatively cheerful and brings a large cluster of grapes with him as a treat, to hide his intentions. As Quasi gets the table ready, Frollo observes that he seems nervous, asking if anything's wrong. When Quasi denies this, Frollo responds, Oh but there is. I know there is. As they eat, he accuses Quasimodo of hiding something. Phoebus nearly gives himself away as he wakes up again, but Quasi covers it up by coughing (and giving Phoebus a swift kick in the face).Frollo notices the carving Quasimodo made of Esmeralda, and tells him he recognizes her. Here he makes his intentions for coming clear; he angrily accuses Quasi of helping her escape, slamming the figure down on the table. He blames him for the fires ravaging Paris. Quasimodo simply says quietly, She was kind to me, Master. Frollo destroys the wooden models of Notre Dame Cathedral and the houses in a fit of rage, crying, YOU IDIOT! That wasn't kindness; it was cunning! She's a Gypsy! Gypsies aren't capable of real love! Think, boy! Think of your mother! By this point he was grasping a terrified Quasimodo, holding his face next to his by his shirt collar. But Frollo quickly checks himself and regains his composure. Saying he doesn't blame Quasi for falling for her enchantments, he tells him not to worry since she'll soon be gone. As he says this, he draws a long dagger from his sleeve and skewers the carving of Esmeralda, burning it over a nearby candle. As he leaves, he tells Quasi that he's found the Court of Miracles, and that he'll attack it at dawn. He descends the stairs with a smile unseen by Quasimodo.Phoebus stands up, having heard the conversation, and says he's going to warn Esmeralda (though he doesn't know where to find her). Seeing that Quasi isn't moving, he asks him if he's coming too. He declines. Phoebus asks, I thought you were Esmeralda's friend? He replies by saying he can't disobey Frollo again. He retorts, She stood up for you! You have a funny way of showing gratitude... He leaves, despite having an injured shoulder.Quasimodo turns and sees the gargoyles giving him a disappointed and questioning look. He responds, What? What am I supposed to do? Go out there and rescue 'the girl' from the jaws of death, then the whole town will cheer like I'm some kind of a hero!? She already has her 'knight in shining armor,' and it's not me! [He sighs] Frollo was right. Frollo was right about everything. And I'm tired of being something I'm not.When Quasi says this, he looks down at the palm of his hand that Esmeralda had earlier proclaimed was free of monster lines. He also looks down at her smoldering carving. He slowly pulls out the woven pendant she gave him, and it is evident that his friendship and care for her has won over his doubt and heartache. Laverne gives him his cloak, and he leaves, saying, I must be out of my mind.Quasi intercepts Phoebus at the cathedral entrance (having climbed down the outside again). Glad that he changed his mind, Phoebus asks him if he knows where to find her. He holds out the pendant and tells Phoebus what Esmeralda said when she gave it to him. As Phoebus attempts to decipher it, Quasi realizes that it's a map. Phoebus disagrees and they argue, but he concedes--saying that if they are going to find her, they'll have to work together. Quasi agrees enthusiastically.They reach a graveyard, and find a tomb with a cross matching the one on the pendant. Phoebus checks for writing and clues, but Quasi simply pushes off the heavy stone covering--revealing stairs. It leads to the old catacombs of Paris, filled with skeletons and sewage. They don't notice several Gypsies disguised as skeletons watching them. They are soon ambushed by Clopin and about 20 Gypsies guarding the way. They tie and gag them, accusing them to be spies (understandable given their connections to Frollo, and few knew of Phoebus' betrayal). They arrive at the Court of Miracles, where they are nearly hanged. Fortunately, Esmeralda was able to stop that from happening, vouching for them.Phoebus, being freed, delivers the warning that Frollo would attack at dawn. Everyone starts to evacuate. Esmeralda hugs Phoebus, saying they're all grateful. He smiles, but notices Quasimodo standing to the side awkwardly. He brings him forward, saying, Without his help, I would never have found my way here.Nor would I, announced Frollo, standing at the entrance with dozens of soldiers running in. They surround and capture the fleeing Gypsies. Frollo callously tells Quasi that he always knew he would be of use to him someday. He tells Esmeralda that Quasi led them right to her; she calls him a liar. He's amused to see Phoebus still alive, saying, Another 'miracle' no doubt. I shall remedy that. He announces a bonfire to take place the next day, implying Esmeralda's execution, and orders his men to lock them up. Quasimodo gets on his knees before Frollo and begs for him to stop, but it is all in vain.The next evening, Esmeralda is tied to a stake on the wooden platform in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame; soldiers place large bundles of sticks by her feet. Phoebus and the Gypsies are forced to watch, being confined to thick metal cages. Frollo reads from a parchment, declaring Esmeralda's crime to be that of witchcraft, and that death is her punishment. A large crowd of Parisians protest, declaring her innocence, but they are held back by soldiers. The Archdeacon too is prevented from interfering.Claude Frollo approaches Esmeralda under the guise of seeking a confession. However, he says to her quietly, Even now it is not too late. I can save you from the flames of this world and the next. Choose me, or the fire. She answers by spitting in his face, glaring at him with hatred and disgust.Meanwhile, Quasimodo stands trapped on the cathedral balcony, tied up with heavy chains between two pillars. The gargoyles feebly attempt to break one of the chains, but Quasi only hangs limply; he'd already tried to break them to no avail. Frollo had already won in his mind. When the gargoyles try to talk him out of this mindset, he curtly tells them to leave. With sadness, they leave one by one, reverting back into inanimate stone. As they go, they say (Hugo, Victor, and Laverne respectively), Okay. Okay, Quasi. We'll leave you alone. After all, we're only made out of stone. We just thought maybe you were made of somethin' stronger...However, as Frollo's judgment and sentencing echo up towards him, a fire lights within him. He looks over the balcony down to the scene below and sees Claude Frollo light the fuel himself. Indignant, Quasimodo pulls the chains taut with such force that the stone pillars crack; even the bells resonate--as if the cathedral itself were crying out at the injustice below. Esmeralda suffers from the smoke as Frollo looks on with an evil grin. Within several seconds, Quasimodo breaks the stone pillars to which he was tied.Freed from the chains, he grabs a nearby rope, lassos it to one of the overhanging gargoyles used for drainage, and rappels down the side of the cathedral. With a running start along the wall, he swings over the heads of the crowd and lands next to Esmeralda--who is unconscious due to smoke suffocation; the flames are but seconds away from reaching her. He breaks her ropes with his hands. As the guards move in to stop him, he rips the giant stake out with one arm and uses it to knock them off the platform with one swing. Taking the rope again, he holds Esmeralda over his shoulder as he swings back over the rest of the soldiers and climbs up the cathedral wall. The crowd is in a frenzy. When he makes it back up on the balcony, he holds Esmeralda above his head, yelling Sanctuary as loudly as his lungs can permit. He then takes her to a nearby room, lays her carefully on the bed, and runs back out to prepare to defend the cathedral.Intent on claiming his desire, Frollo orders his men to break down the doors of the cathedral. Quasi drops a large beam down on them to stop them, crushing Frollo's carriage. They take the beam and use it as a battering ram. Meanwhile, Phoebus found an opportunity to knock his guard out, taking his keys and freeing himself. He stands on his cage with a spear in hand, giving this rousing speech to the crowd: Citizens of Paris! Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city--and now, he has declared war on Notre Dame herself! Will we allow it? The crowd shouts No in return, overpowering the soldiers holding them back. The Gypsies are freed, and a battle ensues before the doors of Notre Dame. Meanwhile, both Quasimodo and the gargoyles employ various methods to keep the soldiers from climbing the walls. Finally, in one last drastic effort, Quasimodo heats some metal (probably copper or lead) to its melting point and pours it into the drainage system. The molten metal spews out of the mouths of the gargoyles (not Victor, Hugo, and Laverne), and rains down upon the invaders. They run before the metal hits them, but Frollo managed to stay behind the molten waterfall. He breaks the rest of the way through the doors.The Archdeacon confronts Frollo, asking, Have you gone mad?! But Frollo throws him down the stairs and goes to the stairway leading to the bell-towers, locking the door behind him. Quasimodo enters Esmeralda's room in celebration, but his cheer ends abruptly when he sees she isn't moving. He tries to get her to drink some water, but it only spills out of her mouth. Realizing what has happened, he holds her in his arms, weeping bitterly.Frollo enters the room quietly, hiding his dagger behind his back. He puts his hand on Quasi's hunched back. Though he didn't look up, he knew who it was, simply whispering, You killed her. Frollo claims he was only doing his duty, expressing his hope that he can forgive him. Quasimodo says nothing. Frollo then acknowledges that Quasimodo has had a hard life, but that the time to end his suffering had come. Sensing something wrong, Quasi looks up and sees the shadow of Claude Frollo holding the dagger above his head. He turns in time to grab Frollo's arm before it can reach him. He hesitates for a few seconds, but then he throws Frollo against the wall, taking the dagger from him. He approaches him while holding the dagger, shaking with anger. Frollo attempts to calm him down, asking him to listen, but Quasimodo yells, No, you listen! All my life you have told me that the world is a dark, cruel place--but now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you!A voice faintly calls out for Quasimodo. It's Esmeralda, who had not died, but was almost killed from the smoke; she only just regained consciousness. Determined to finish the job, Frollo draws his sword, but Quasimodo takes her in his arms and runs out the door as fast as he can move. Frollo pursues, and eventually finds them hanging onto a gargoyle under the guardrail. He strikes at them with his sword several times (nicking Quasi's arm at least once) as he swings among the gargoyles--with Esmeralda holding on to him for dear life. They're able to get back up onto the guardrail, and Quasi pushes Esmeralda to safety as Frollo nearly hits them again. With malicious intent, Frollo tells him, I should have known you'd risk your life to save that Gypsy witch... just as your own mother died trying to save you. Shocked by this revelation, Quasimodo nearly falls when Frollo smothers him with his cape. However, he grabs the bottom of the railing in time, pulling Frollo down after him--but he doesn't let him go. As Frollo swings and grabs an adjacent gargoyle, all of the events of the past day (both physical and emotional) finally catch up with Quasimodo, and he loses consciousness.Fortunately, Esmeralda had regained enough strength to grab Quasi's hand before he let go; however, she wasn't strong enough to pull him up, and she was losing her grip. Frollo stands up on the gargoyle, laughing quietly but maniacally--and he lifts his sword above his head to kill Esmeralda. She looks on in horror, but she doesn't let Quasi go to save herself. Frollo smiles evilly and says, And He shall smite the wicked, and plunge them into the fiery pit. As if in answer to his proclamation, the gargoyle begins to break beneath his feet. He grabs hold underneath it as he falls, and from his perspective it appears to come alive--it's eyes and mouth glowing with heat and roaring at him with fury. He screams in fear and anguish as the gargoyle breaks off completely, and he falls to his death into the fiery lake of molten metal--as if he were taken straight to hell itself.Unfortunately, Esmeralda loses her grip on Quasi, and she cries out as he falls. But with perfect timing, Phoebus (who had entered the cathedral unnoticed after the metal stopped pouring) reaches out from a lower floor and grabs him, pulling him in. Seeing this, Esmeralda runs to the stairwell. The fall and sudden stop had awoken Quasimodo, and seeing Phoebus, he gives him a big hug in gratitude. Esmeralda enters, and when she sees Quasi alive and well, she runs and embraces him tenderly. They turn to look at Phoebus. Quasimodo takes their hands and clasps them together. Phoebus and Esmeralda embrace each other and kiss--and Quasimodo smiles, being at peace with their love for each other.In the morning, Phoebus and Esmeralda exit the Cathedral of Notre Dame and are greeted by a cheering crowd. The two raise their hands together in triumph. But instead of going to them, Esmeralda goes back to the doorway of the cathedral and holds her hand out for Quasimodo. He takes it and hesitantly walks out into the light with her. With Frollo dead, his need for sanctuary--claimed by his loving mother so many years ago--is lifted. The people are uncertain how to react. Quasimodo looks worried that he might get rejected again.However, a child leaves her mother's side and approaches him. (It is one of the children who watched Clopin's puppet show at the beginning.) Though she's a little nervous (so is Quasi), she reaches for his neck to give him a hug; seeing what she's trying to do, he smiles and lowers himself to her reaching distance. Smiling too as she hugs him, she takes his hand and leads him to the rest of the people--who begin to warm up to him. Clopin shouts, Three cheers for Quasimodo! The crowd cheers, and they pick him up to go off and celebrate. Esmeralda and Phoebus (and Djali) watch him fondly. Clopin picks up the child and says (sings), mirroring his words at the beginning,  'So here is a riddle to guess if you can,' sing the bells of Notre Dame. 'What makes a monster, and what makes a man?' Whatever their pitch, you can feel them bewitch you, the rich and the ritual knells of the bells of Notre Dame!As the citizens of Paris carry him away on their shoulders, Quasimodo is at long last genuinely accepted among them--not as a sideshow and a monster, but as a friend and a man.

title: Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue
synopsis: In Corey's bedroom, an unseen person steals her piggy bank from her dresser. The theft is witnessed by Papa Smurf, who emerges from a Smurfs comic book with the other Smurfs and alerts the other cartoon characters in the room (Garfield as a lamp, ALF from a framed picture, Baby Kermit as an alarm clock, Winnie the Pooh as a doll, Alvin and the Chipmunks from a record sleeve, and Slimer who passes through a wall).
The cartoon characters track down the thief and discover that it is Corey's big brother, Michael. Simon opens a box under Michael's bed and identifies its contents as marijuana. Meanwhile, Corey expresses her concerns about Michael's change in behavior. He storms out of the house. The cartoon characters quickly realize that something must be done about his addiction and they set off, leaving Pooh behind to look after Corey.
At the arcade, Michael smokes pot with his old friends and Smoke, an anthropomorphic cloud of smoke. They run out and are chased into an alleyway by a policeman. The policeman is then revealed to be Bugs Bunny wearing a policeman's hat. Bugs traps Smoke in a garbage can and uses a time machine to see when and how Michael's addiction was started.
Meanwhile, at home, Corey and Michael's parents are concern about their son's behavior, but Corey passes it off as nothing despite also being worried about. Pooh then approaches her and questions her about Michael, which she responds saying she doesn't want to get Michael into trouble, Pooh however tries to reason with her.
Inside a Hall of Mirrors, ALF shows Michael his reflection of how he is today, then his reflection if he does not stop taking drugs: an aged, corpse-like version of himself. When Michael insists that he could quit if he wants to and that he is in charge of his own life, ALF takes him to see the man in charge — Smoke.
Corey and Pooh re-enter Michael's room and find his marijuana box. Smoke appears and throws Pooh inside a cabinet and tempts Corey to try the drug. Corey reasons that if she does what Michael does, then maybe they could have fun together, like they used to before he started doing drugs.
Michael comes back into his bedroom, just in time to stop Corey from using the drugs herself. He tells her that he never wants to see her end up like him, and admits he was wrong, though he is unsure if he can change. She advises him to talk about his problems to their parents and to her. Smoke tries to persuade him otherwise, but Michael throws him out of the window, as he feels that he listened to him long enough. While in a garbage truck, Smoke vows to return saying [Michael] can bet on it! The special ends with Michael letting Pooh out of the cabinet and Michael and Corey go tell their parents about Michael's drug problem, while Pooh jumps into a poster on the wall with the other cartoon characters.

title: The Windblown Hare
synopsis: The Three Little Pigs, reading their own story in a book of fairy tales, decide to circumvent the story by selling both the straw house and the wooden house before the Wolf can blow them down.
Bugs is easily conned into buying the straw house cheap. Along comes the Wolf, reading the book, too. As per the plot, he blows down the straw house just as homeowner Bugs starts to greet him with his catchphrase Eh, what's up, Doc?.
Bugs then buys the wooden house from the second pig, and the three then hole up in the brick house – knowing from the book that the Wolf can't blow it down. Along comes the Wolf again, book in hand, and blows down the wooden house over Bugs' objections. That prompts the Bunny to deliver payback to the Wolf.
To get revenge on the Wolf, Bugs dresses up as Little Red Riding Hood and skips down the roadway. He meets the Wolf sitting under a tree, reading the end of the story. The Wolf asks the girl where she is going and Bugs flips the Wolf's book a few pages. The Wolf then speed-reads Little Red Riding Hood until he realizes he's behind schedule for that story.
The Wolf races over to Grandma's house but rather than eat her, he kicks her out of the house with barely time to get her nightclothes on. The Rabbit in Red arrives shortly thereafter. When Bugs Bunny says what big eyes, ears, teeth, and feet the wolf has when he's in grandma's clothing, he pokes both the wolf's eyes, pulls his ears up and down, and pull out his teeth and back in his mouth. The Wolf retaliates by pulling on Bugs' ears, but Bugs counters that by stepping on the Wolf's foot. After both of them strip each other's disguises they argue, with Bugs exclaiming, Why, Granny! You're just a wolf in cheap clothing!
Bugs then refuses to give the Wolf the present he brought him. After the Wolf begs Bugs to give him his present, Bugs relents and puts the present (a cake) right into the Wolf's face, telling the Wolf you asked for it!. Pursued down the basement steps of Grandma's house, Bugs turns off the light switch downstairs, making the Wolf to go back to the upstairs switch to restore the light rather than risk Bugs' counterattack. After this procedure is repeated, Bugs tricks the Wolf by saying click instead of actually turning off the light, prompting the Wolf to automatically turn the upstairs light off and continue down the stairs, allowing Bugs to hit him.
Bugs tries to escape on a bicycle, but it turns out to be a tandem with the Wolf in the second seat. He steers into a clothesline, yanking the Wolf out of the seat. When Bugs chides the Wolf for blowing his houses down, the Wolf explains those are the Pigs' houses and that he's doing what the story says and Bugs then sees what's going on.
Arriving at the brick house, Bugs sees the pigs playing cards and gloating about cheating him into buying their houses. Realizing he was swindled by them intentionally, Bugs directs the Wolf to the pigs' last house to blow it down. The Wolf says he can't because the story says so. However, Bugs tells him to blow the house down regardless and reveals he wants revenge against the pigs for ripping him off. The pigs laugh as the wolf blows, and then the house suddenly blows up. The Wolf says, I did it! The pigs look at him in surprise and say, He did it!. The scene cuts to Bugs, who pats a TNT detonator, says Eh, we did it!, and laughs smugly.

title: Raw Nerve
synopsis: A series of grotesque murders plagues the city of Mobile, Alabama where an unknown serial killer is killing women with a pump-action shotgun. A young race car driver, named Jimmy Clayton (Ted Prior), goes to the police where he talks with Lt. Detective Bruce Ellis (Jan-Michael Vincent) and his superior Captain Gavin (Glenn Ford) claiming that he has been having visions about the killer. Unfortunately, the police do not take him seriously, and Jimmy gets locked up as the suspect. A lady reporter named Gloria Freedman (Sandal Bergman), who happens to be Ellis's ex-wife, falls in love with Jimmy and sets out prove his innocence and find the real killer.
Meanwhile, a rogue biker named Blake Garrett (Tex Cobb) learns about the murders and that Jimmy may be a suspect. He follows and accosts Gloria; telling her to stay away from Jimmy. Then Blake kidnaps Jimmy's younger sister Gina (Traci Lords) and attempts to leave the country with her, claiming that he is protecting her. When Lt. Ellis begins to believe Jimmy's claims of innocence, he has Jimmy released and has him followed to find Blake who takes Gina to a local airport who is attempting to leave the country with her. Thinking that Blake is the serial killer, the police chase him through the airport and in his pickup truck through the city where they corner him on a top ledge of a parking garage. When Jimmy attempts to talk to Blake, he releases Gina but drives his truck off the ledge and kills himself. When Captain Gavin finds a shotgun in Blake's truck which forensic tests prove it to be the murder weapon, the case of the shotgun slayings is closed. Or is it?
In the final scene, Gloria goes to Jimmy's house one evening for them go out on their first date when Jimmy begins acting strange toward her and suddenly attempts to kill her. It is revealed here that Jimmy really is the killer all along and that he committed the murders under a split-personality. Jimmy's alter ego, whom is named 'Billy', murdered his and Gina's parents years earlier after they found out that Jimmy has dissociative identity disorder resulting from physical abuse by both his mother and father. Blake knew the whole time about Jimmy's D.I.D. and protected him out of blind loyalty. When Jimmy apparently discovered the truth, 'Billy' completely took over and he attempts to kill Gloria (A very similar plot twist and setting is used several years later in the 2005 thriller Hide and Seek.) After a chase through the house, just when Gloria is about to be killed, Lt. Ellis runs in and saves her by shooting Billy/Jimmy dead.

title: In the Bedroom
synopsis: The film is set in the Mid-Coast town of Camden, Maine. Matt (Tom Wilkinson) and Ruth Fowler (Sissy Spacek) enjoy a happy marriage and a good relationship with their son Frank (Nick Stahl), a recent college graduate who has come home for the summer. Frank has fallen in love with an older woman with children, Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei).
Frank is about to begin post graduate school for architecture, but is having second-thoughts and considering staying in town to continue working as a fisherman and, more importantly, to be near Natalie. Natalie's ex-husband, Richard Strout (William Mapother), tries to find a way into his ex-wife and children's lives, going to increasingly violent lengths to get his intentions across to Natalie. Ruth is openly concerned about Frank's relationship with Natalie, while Matt thinks it is only a fling.
Midway through the film, Richard kills Frank during a confrontation at Natalie's house following a domestic dispute. Though equally devastated, Matt and Ruth grieve in different ways, with Matt putting on a brave face while Ruth becomes reclusive and quiet. Richard is set free on bail, paid by his well-to-do family, and both Matt and Ruth are forced to see Richard around town.
The tension between Matt & Ruth increases when they learn that the lack of an eyewitness to Frank's shooting means Richard will instead be charged with accidental manslaughter. An argument erupts between the couple in which each one confronts the other. With the air cleared, the couple is finally able to find common ground in their grief.
Matt then abducts and kills Richard. He and a friend bury the body on the friend's wooded property. Matt returns home to Ruth, who is awake and smoking in bed. She asks him, Did you do it? Matt appears troubled and unresponsive. He climbs into bed and then turns away from her. Finally, Ruth gets up to make coffee. Matt rolls over onto his back and pulls a band-aid from a finger he injured hauling traps. Ruth calls from the kitchen, Matt, do you want coffee? Matt doesn't answer.

title: The Wedding Party
synopsis: A heatwave has hit Torquay, bringing Basil's incompetence—not to mention his intolerance—to an all-time high. When he realises that the two young lovers Alan and Jean, who are checking in, aren't married, he tries to force them into single rooms on separate floors. Meanwhile, Mrs. Peignoir, an attractive French antique dealer, seems to have taken a shine to Basil, much to Sybil's annoyance. Alan returns to the lobby and asks Basil if he knows whether any chemists are still open. Basil initially assumes he wants to buy condoms, then when Alan says he wants batteries, Basil – still assuming it must be sex-related – tells him that is disgusting. When Alan explains that he wanted batteries for his electric razor, Basil tries to save the situation. Later that evening, Mrs. Peignoir arrives home and drunkenly trips over Basil as he crouches on the floor picking up her purse that she has dropped, ending up sitting on him. At that moment Alan and Jean also arrive, witnessing what appears to them to be a very intimate situation. Later that same night Manuel, who had been out celebrating his birthday, returns home drunk with his umbrella (a birthday gift from Basil) outside Basil and Sybil's door and accidentally hits Basil over the head with the umbrella. As Basil crumples to the floor in pain, Manuel drunkenly sits over him, saying Mr Fawlty, I love you, I love you .... and once more Alan walks in on the situation. Then Basil strangles Manuel.
Jean's mother and stepfather Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd arrive next morning. Basil soon notices strange going-ons between the Lloyds, Jean, Alan, and Polly. For example, Basil accidentally walks in on Jean hugging Mr. Lloyd, and not realising that they are family he tries to keep Mrs. Lloyd from the room where he saw them embracing. He shows her the kitchen, where Manuel is sleeping off the previous night's celebration in the linen basket. Finally he lets her up to the room, only to discover Polly (a family friend of the Lloyds) is now hugging Mr. Lloyd. He again distracts the now very edgy Mrs. Lloyd by showing her another room, explaining that the Lloyds' room is not as nice. When Mrs. Lloyd enters the room, she realies that it is exactly the same as the one Basil showed her. As he is leaving the room, Basil hears loud moaning noises from Alan and Jean's room and Polly hurries out, dressing herself (she has been trying on a dress Jean made for her and the moaning was because Jean had been massaging Alan's shoulders). Thinking the worst, Basil prepares to fire Polly and tells the Lloyds to leave. Sybil explains that they are one family and that Polly went to school with Jean, and has known them for years. Basil, feeling shocked and stupid for his actions, argues with Sybil about apologising to them, saying sarcastically No, no, I suppose it's all my fault, isn't it? But Sybil insists and advises him to Tell them you made a mistake. So he rehearses the apology (to Sybil, to Polly, to himself and to empty space) I'm so sorry, I made a mistake, but by the time he reaches the guests' room, the sentence has become I'm so sorry, but my wife has made a mistake!
Sybil's good friend Audrey has split up from her husband, much to Basil's irritation as she's constantly on the phone and repeating the phrase 'Ooh, I know'. She goes to visit Audrey the following day and, as Major Gowen puts it, listen to all that rubbish while consoling her friend. A flirtatious Mrs. Peignoir tries to charm Basil that night while Sybil is away, and he is very jumpy in the evening. As he tries to undress someone keeps knocking at his door, and he believes it to be Mrs. Peignoir trying to seduce him again. However, when he realises it is actually Sybil returned early, he opens the door and unconvincingly says Oh, what a terrible dream, trying to explain his previous whispers to Mrs. Peignoir (as he thought) to go away. Sybil, however, doesn't notice his odd behaviour, as she tells Basil that she has heard a burglar downstairs. Both are unaware that it is actually Manuel, who has awakened from the linen basket, still hung over. Basil quietly creeps downstairs in his underwear and hits 'the burglar' over the head with a frying pan. Manuel is revealed unconscious, and Basil crouches over him in the foyer. Just as Basil realises who it is, Alan, Jean and the Lloyds walk into the hotel, where they are confronted by the sight of Basil apparently lying on top of Manuel with no trousers on. They creep past, bemused by his behaviour, and Mr Lloyd, slightly drunk, says to Basil We've been to a wedding. In frustration and humiliation, Basil draws back the frying pan for a final vengeful clout.

title: Retro Puppet Master
synopsis: The film begins in 1944, Switzerland, taking place after the events of Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge. Toulon and his little friends are still on the run, and decide to hide in the Kolewige, an inn 4 miles from the Swiss border. Blade finds the wooden head of an old puppet named Cyclops in their trunk, and when Toulon sees it, he then tells his puppets the adventures with the woman he loves, and his retro puppets, starting in Cairo, Egypt, in 1902.
A 3,000-year-old Egyptian sorcerer, named Afzel, has stolen the secret of life, and is fleeing the servants of an evil Egyptian god, named Sutekh. Two servants, imbued with magical power from Sutekh, attack him, but are killed easily by Afzel and his own magical power. After dispatching the two servants he begins his journey to Paris.
Meanwhile, Sutekh has given life to three of his oldest servants—Egyptian mummies. After they rise from their chamber they too begin to pursue Afzel. Cut to Paris, where a young Andre Toulon is putting on a puppet show of Dante's Divine Comedy. Watching from the crowd is Elsa, who has left her cold-hearted abusive ambassador father and harmless mother (who wasn't in this) to view the wonders of the country and has decided to see the play. In the sewers nearby the three mummies have hired two thugs to kill Afzel. The thugs are necessary since Afzel has the power to sense the coming of the mummies.
Afzel is beaten brutally until Elsa, leaving the theater, sees them and cries for help. The thugs then scatter, leaving Toulon and Elsa to pick Afzel up and bring him inside. Later, when he stirs from his sleep, he talks with Toulon and reveals that he knows the secret of life, and it's the only thing that can protect humankind when the elder gods rise up in 100-1,000 years, and needs to pass it on to Toulon. Toulon is skeptical until Afzel begins to make the puppets move. Now Toulon realizes he is genuine and begins to learn his powers. Then Afzel starts to make the puppets draw a barrier that's supposed to protect him if the servants come back.
While stepping outside for a brief moment, Toulon begins to talk to a beggar who has sat on the steps since the beginning of the movie. However, he is dead, and when Andre becomes aware of this he begins to mourn. Afzel tells him to bring him inside to teach him the true secret of life. After bringing him inside they use a ring to transfer the soul of the beggar to the puppet, Pinhead. The puppet starts to move but, after a few questions the puppet runs away into the theater. Later on, Elsa returns to talk to Toulon, until her father's rude servants come by, and they take Elsa and Toulon back to her house, and after Toulon talks to the father, he gets knocked out, and is then thrown into the woods.
The next day, back at the theater, Valentin storms in as the barrier written on paper falls off the wall. The three mummies see their chance to attack and begin their rampage through the theater. Valentin finishes repairing the door as two of the mummies break in and kill him. Vigo runs backstage to Duval and Latour and falls dead. Duval stabs the lead mummy in his hand as the mummy kills him with his other hand. Latuor gets out a gun and shoots the lead mummy three times as the other mummy comes in through the back door and all three of them use their magic to kill him. Afzel appears and says Sutekh shall not claim his life, and kills himself with his own magic. Satisfied with victory, the mummies begin to leave. Once Toulon returns from the woods, he sees what has happened and acts quickly by putting their souls inside his puppets.
The men return, having sensed someone with the knowledge of the secret of life, and try to kill Toulon. His puppets, however, kill one of the mummies with Six Shooter by shooting the chandelier chains, causing it to crush the servant. The two henchmen retreat in order to plot the capture of Elsa to lure Toulon into a trap.
Feeling that he had won the battle, Andre and his puppets go to a train station to leave Paris to Kara, Togo before things start to get bad, not realizing they had already begun. The servants killed her parents, the guards and capture Elsa, and then send a dream to Toulon that shows Elsa tied up, and a train. Knowing the meaning, he quickly changes trains to Merca, Somalia and gets his puppets ready for the showdown. When the train leaves, Andre looks around, having released his puppets and letting them follow him throughout the train, until finally coming to the last car and finding Elsa tied up like in his dream. The two men appear and ask for the secret of life. Andre displays the scroll where the secret is written and asks, How do you know I haven't copied it? to which the leader states he did not have enough time to do so, but still is doubtful he hadn't. Andre, noticing he is distracted, attacks the leader while his puppets attack the other. A large struggle breaks out, and the other henchman is killed with the final leader of the three being thrown from the car. Freeing Elsa, the group rides away in the train, beginning their adventure. After telling the story, the puppets wonder what happened to the other puppets. Andre tells them that's another story, which he will tell them in the future.

title: Benny's Video
synopsis: The film opens with a home video of the slaughter with a captive bolt pistol of a pig on a European farm. The video rewinds to play the slaughter in slow motion, which emphasizes the hand-held barrel against the pig's fore-skull and the cartridge explosion. A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna, when they return home while the party is in progress. The host of the party, Eva, is their daughter who lives in another part of town and who has, it turns out in questioning of Benny after the incident, taken advantage of the planned absence of Georg and Anna to host the impromptu party in their home. While watching a newscast, Georg and Anna discuss the money Eva won in the pyramid scheme she was promoting at the party. In a locker room at school, Benny encourages his friends to take positions in his own Pilot and Passengers game.
While his parents are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. He shows her the video of the pig slaughter, and they talk about the film. She: Did you make this film? How was it, with the pig? I mean, have you ever seen a dead person--a real one, I mean? Benny: No. I once saw a TV program about the tricks they use in action films. It's all ketchup and plastic, and then he unveils and loads the slaughtering gun. He holds it against his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward (Feigling!). He holds it against her chest, and when he hesitates, she calls him a Feigling also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame, Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back partially into frame, Benny again reloading and firing, this time apparently at her head, and, finally, her body remaining still.
During a choir practice of the Bach motet Trotz dem alten Drachen, Benny completes his pyramid scheme. Then at home again, with the weekend begun, Benny first covers the body, goes through her school bag, arranges an evening out with friends, eats snacks, moves the girl's body to a closet, and cleans up the blood. Some of the cleanup is seen through a video monitor, while Benny edits a video of the experience. Benny goes out to a dance club and stays overnight at his friend's home, and, on his way home, goes to a cinema, window shops, and gets his hair shorn to the scalp.
After his parents return, his father harangues Benny about his haircut, asking if Benny had any thought about how others would react to him now. Later on, while the family is watching the news in Benny's room, Benny switches the signal to the video he has made, to the game of dares and the ensuing three shots. Benny reveals the body in his closet, and Georg removes the videotape, asks if anyone else knows about this, and through careful grilling finds that there are no witnesses.
Clearly disturbed, the father and mother leave Benny's room, and Benny asks that the door be left open. In the living room, Georg lists—rather dispassionately—the options they have: either to alert the authorities, with a resulting judgment of parental neglect and placement of their son in a psychiatric institution, or to destroy the evidence. Anna urges—with understated passion after warnings from Georg not to fall apart—that any option chosen must be carefully followed to its end.
Anna takes Benny on vacation to Egypt, and the ever-present video camera captures them both in their hotel, in the village, touring ancient tombs, watching sail-gliders at the beach, even a private moment of Anna in the bathroom. There are several phone calls from a booth in the post office, with Benny and Anna separately taking the phone. Benny seems barely affected by any recent past, and he seems unable to fathom why his mother breaks down in sobs at one point during the vacation. When they return home after six days, the apartment is clean of any trace of the girl. Georg, who had stayed at home, succeeded in cutting the body into small enough pieces to be flushed down the toilet or otherwise inconspicuously removed. That evening, Georg asks Benny Why did you do it? and the reply is, I don't know. ...I wanted to see what it's like, possibly. Benny has no answer to Georg's question, And what was it like?
On video, we see another Pilot and Passengers party, this time being hosted by Georg and Anna. In life, we see Anna and Georg at a concert of the choir Benny is in. The choir sings: Despite the ancient dragon, despite the gaping jaws of death, despite the constant fear, let the world rage and toss. I stand here and sing in perfect calm. On video, we see from the door of Benny's darkened bedroom, standing slightly ajar, and we hear faint voices discussing what to do. In life, a voice-over asks, Why did you come to us now? We see Benny being interviewed by policemen, and he answers merely, Because. With no following questions, Benny asks, Can I go now? After the questioning, Benny meets Georg and Anna in the hall and, after a long moment, says merely, Entschuldigung. (Excuse me, as it is used to apologize for brushing by a stranger in a crowded location.)

title: Zabriskie Point
synopsis: In a room at a university campus in 1970, white and black students argue about an impending student strike. Mark (Mark Frechette) leaves the meeting after saying he is willing to die, but not of boredom for the cause, which draws criticism from the young white radicals. Following a mass arrest at the campus protest, Mark visits a police station hoping to bail his roommate out of jail. He is told to wait but goes to the lock-up area, asks further about bail for his roommate, is rebuffed, calls out to the arrested students and faculty and is arrested. He gives his name as Karl Marx, which a duty officer types as Carl Marx. After he is released from jail, Mark and another friend buy firearms from a Los Angeles gun shop, saying they need them for self-defense to protect our women.
In a downtown Los Angeles office building, successful real estate executive Lee Allen (Rod Taylor) reviews a television commercial for Sunny Dunes, a new resort-like real estate development in the desert. Instead of actors or models, the slickly produced commercial features casually dressed, smiling mannequins. In the next scene Allen talks with his associate (G. D. Spradlin) about the greater Los Angeles area's very rapid growth as the two drive through crowded streets.
Mark goes to a bloody campus confrontation between students and police. Some students are tear-gassed and at least one is shot. As Mark reaches for a gun in his boot, a Los Angeles policeman is seen being fatally shot, although it is unclear by whom. Mark flees the campus and rides a city bus to suburban Hawthorne where, after failing to buy a sandwich on credit from a local blue-collar delicatessen, he walks to HawthorneMunicipal Airport, steals a small Cessna 210 aircraft and flies into the desert.
Meanwhile, Daria (Daria Halprin), a sweet, pot-smoking post-teenybopper of decent inclinations, is driving across the desert towards Phoenix in a 1950s-era Buick automobile to meet her boss, Lee, who may or may not also be her lover. Along the way Daria is searching for a man, who works with emotionally disturbed children from Los Angeles. She finds the young boys near a roadhouse in the Mojave desert but they tease, taunt, and grab at her, boldly asking for a piece of ass, to which she asks in reply, are you sure you'd know what to do with it?
Daria flees in her car. While filling its radiator with water, she is spied from the air by Mark, who buzzes her car and then flies only 15 feet over Daria as she lies face down in the sand. He throws a T-shirt out of the window of the aircraft for her to pick up. Daria goes from upset to curious and smiling during this sequence.
They later meet at the desert shack of an old man, where Mark asks her for a lift so he can buy gasoline for the aircraft. The two then wander to Zabriskie Point, where they make love and the site's geological formations seem to come alive in a dusty orgy. 
Later, a California highway patrolman suspiciously questions Daria. Hidden behind a portable toilet meant for tourists, Mark takes aim at the policeman but Daria stands between the two of them to block this, apparently saving the policeman's life before he drives away. Daria asks Mark if he was the one who killed the cop in Los Angeles. He states that he wanted to, but someone else shot the officer first and that he never got off a shot.
Getting back to the stolen aircraft, they paint it with politically charged slogans and psychedelic colors. Daria pleads with Mark to travel with her and leave the aircraft but Mark is intent on returning and taking the risks that it involves. He flies back to Los Angeles and lands the plane at the airport in Hawthorne. The police (along with some radio and television reporters) are waiting for him. and patrol cars chase the aircraft down the runway. Rather than stopping, Mark tries to turn the taxiing aircraft around across the grass and is shot to death by one of the policemen.
Daria learns about Mark's death on the car radio. She drives to Lee's lavish desert home, a desert Berchtesgaden set high on a rock outcropping near Phoenix, where she sees three affluent women sunning themselves and chatting by the swimming pool. She grieves for Mark by drenching herself in the house's architectural waterfall. Lee is deeply immersed in a business meeting having to do with the complex and financially risky Sunny Dunes development. Taking a break, he spots Daria in the house and happily greets her. She goes downstairs alone and finds the guest room that has been set aside for her but after briefly opening the door, she shuts it again.
Upon the sight of a young Native American housekeeper in the hallway, Daria leaves without a further word. She drives off but stops to get out of the car and look back at the house, leaving her own imagination seeing it repeatedly blown apart in billows of orange flame and household items.

title: A-Lad-in His Lamp
synopsis: Bugs finds Aladdin's lamp while digging a rabbit hole; believing it was junk, he starts to clean it so he could use it for an ashtray, and a genie appears and tells him to make a wish. Calling him Smokey, Bugs reluctantly starts to make multiple wishes, only to be interrupted by the genie each time; Bugs ultimately requests two carrots, which the genie produces. Smokey remarks that he wants to return to his home in Baghdad and Bugs, imagining how fabulous it must be, wishes he could go to Baghdad. Smokey then puts him in the lamp and fires him it like a cannon, as the two fly off to Baghdad, with Bugs flying like an airplane (Hey, look fellas, I'm a 'hare-plane'!). Before they arrive in Baghdad, the aerial view depicts two bodies of water named Veronica Lake and Turhan Bay; when in the city, the view includes places such as The Brown Turban, the Temple Bell telephone company with a sign for Persian to Persian calls, and Mad Man Hassan's used magic carpet lot.
Bugs and the Genie in the lamp arrive in Baghdad, but Bugs' flying in the air sputters and conks out and Bugs and the lamp fall into the Royal Palace of Caliph Hassen Pfeffer (built on a GI Loan), first angering the Caliph, who then wants the lamp. When Bugs refuses (Eh, correction, doc. Bugs Bunny's lamp!), the Caliph threatens Bugs at swordpoint (Just a minute, doc. Let's not start splitting hares!); after Bugs escapes the sword, a chase starts. When Bugs hides behind a door and ladies shriek, forcing him out of that room, Bugs points out it is a harem (Er, uh, a 'hare-um', I think.), which encourages Smokey to pop out and take a peek himself (Oh, that was a harem, alright! I know a harem when I see one!)
Bugs' attempts to get the lazy genie's help fail: successive attempts find Smokey bathing (Oh fiddledee-dee-dee! Don't I even get a chance to take a bath? Now, don't bother me!), eating (Oh, sweet spirits of camphor! Can't a man get any nourishment around here? Now, go away!), and beating Bugs with a stick. Bugs quickly tries to escape from the Caliph by taking a magic carpet, rigged with an outboard motor. On the magic carpet, Bugs tries again but interrupts the genie, who is kissing a female genie; her disappearance prompts Smokey to leave, but only after threatening Bugs, Now you've done it! You've made me simply furious! If you disturb me once more, I'll beat you to a pulp!.
At this moment, the magic carpet runs out of gas, making Bugs crash land back into the palace and the Caliph has the lamp now. When the Caliph tries to get the genie out of the lamp, in spite of Bugs warning him not to, having remembered Smokey's earlier threat if he's disturbed again, (You'll be SORRY!), Smokey erupts, larger and angrier than before and beats the Caliph to a pulp. Cheering Bugs on his victory, he grants Bugs a wish as a celebration. He whispers to Smokey, who produces a ball that ends up as a puff of smoke when dropped. The scene concludes showing Bugs as a Caliph himself, surrounded by a harem of female rabbits and wondering what the poor rabbits are doing this season.

title: Roadie
synopsis: Travis W. Redfish (Meat Loaf) is a beer-drinking, bar-brawling, fun-loving distributor of Shiner beer. He also helps his father, Corpus C. Redfish (Art Carney) with the family salvage company, whose motto is Everything will work if you let it! B.B. Muldoon (Gailard Sartain) is both his best friend and business partner.
In the opening scene, B.B., driving their Shiner beer truck, arrives at the Redfish family home and business to pick Travis up for work. A short time later, after embarking on their daily delivery route, they notice an RV that has broken down on the side of the road. At first, they laugh at the thought of helping the stranded motorists. Until, that is, Travis sees wannabee groupie Lola Bouliabaise (Kaki Hunter) smile at him through the rear window of the RV. Redfish slams on the brakes and decides to help, hoping to get a closer look at Lola. Lola is a big Alice Cooper fan and Travis has never heard of her. 'Ace' (Joe Spano), a road manager, and his assistant George, try to talk Travis into driving them to Austin for a show to be played by Hank Williams Jr. and put on by music mogul Mohammed Johnson. He meets Bird Lockhart, a hippie and lifelong roadie in the music business. After repairing the RV Lola is able to talk Travis into coming along where he ends up becoming the greatest roadie that ever lived with his unusual techniques on fixing things.
On the road, Redfish gets into a bar fight with Tiny Thompson after Lola accidentally ruins his little sister's hair by dumping beer on it in an attempt to meet Roy Orbison. After knocking heads, Travis ends up with Brain-Lock that he developed in the war and only a pitcher of beer will cure him.

title: Hombre mirando al sudeste
synopsis: The staff and patients go about their daily business at Buenos Aires' José Borda Psychiatric Hospital on a summer day in 1985. A staff psychiatrist, Dr. Julio Denis (Lorenzo Quinteros) is surprised to hear that his ward for non-violent delusional cases has one patient too many. Denis finds the patient in the chapel playing the organ like a virtuoso. Summoning him (Hugo Soto) to his office, Denis finds the man's speech is measured and articulate as he explains his presence on Earth as a result of his image being projected from light years away. He introduces himself as Rantés (an exotic-sounding name in Argentina). Dr. Denis suggests that Rantés might be a fugitive hoping to hide from the law in the hospital. He lets the patient stay however, after seeing how his caring touch helps the other patients. The doctor is amused by his extraterrestrial claims and he suspects that the man is a genius using his talents as a charade.
Julio Denis is a highly professional, lonely man, whose recent divorce left him jaded towards his life and work. Since his wife remarried, he settles for weekly outings with his two children and grainy home movies of happier times, which he views every night. Rantés, noticing the wounded Dr. Denis, is as interested in his troubles as the doctor is in Rantés, the first patient in a long time that has interested him at all. Believing his claim to be a projected hologram, an allusion to Adolfo Bioy Casares' novel, Morel's Invention, Dr. Denis concludes that this impressive genius is very well-read. The doctor soon uses his prerogatives to include Rantés in several outings, including a visit to a touring Moscow State Circus performance.
Rantés is no ordinary man, though. Having a psychokinetic gift, he quickly finds ways to explore the city on his own and without permission. Compassionate to a fault, he uses this gift to the benefit of the hungry, narrowly skirting the law. He spends hours standing in one of the Asylum's Courtyards, completely motionless, facing southeast. He claims to do this to receive transmissions from his planet and that he implies that he is actually the doctor's own hallucination. In narration, Dr. Denis claims that he appears to be the only physician who still notices the polite, unproblematic patient, but it's clear in a subsequent scene that he is not since the Doctor gets Rantés a job in the Pathology department of the Hospital. Because of Rantés kindness to everyone, he quickly earns the loyalty of the other patients and Dr. Denis' growing confused respect.
The doctor is aware that Rantés has been leaving without permission and has avoided taking his medicine; but he is impressed and he takes Rantés' requests seriously, persuading the head of pathology, Dr. Prieto, to hire him as a volunteer assistant. Prieto (Rubens Correa) admits that Rantés would be his first assistant in some time (having lost his due to budget cuts).
Surprising everyone, Rantés is visited by an attractive young lady, Beatriz (Inés Vernengo). She and Rantés clearly know each other and Dr. Denis hopes she can shed light on his mysterious patient's identity. Dr. Denis introduces himself to Beatriz and it's obvious he is attracted to her. She tells Denis of Rantés' work among children in a slum, where they met while working for a Evangelical mission, and especially his devotion to a young child with superior musical abilities; beyond that, she knows him as a very good man whom she is only casually acquainted with.
Dr. Denis is charmed by the woman and asks Rantés about her. He responds that she is very special and a Saint.
Dr. Denis invites both of them to an outdoor classical concert. During the concert, captivated by the music, Rantés asks Beatriz to dance. The audience finds this amusing and exciting, and some of them decide to follow suit and also dance. Rantés becomes even more entranced by the Music as the orchestra plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He eventually persuades the conductor to let him take the baton for the symphony's iconic Ode to Joy, which confuses the Musicians, leading to their refusing to play with him. After a few false starts with Rantés trying to conduct the Orchestra, the musicians eventually decide to play as Rantés conducts them. The Audience is even more amused and excited by the situation while concurrently at the Asylum, the Patients start to get excited and agitated and then parade the ground in a state of joy, and eventually into the town where the concert is being held. The Police arrive and are about to remove Rantés from the conducting podium when the actual conductor convinces them to not remove Rantés. Rantés finishes and is arrested.
Confronted by an angry hospital director (David Edery), Dr. Denis is less concerned for his job than he is for his impetuous friend, whom the director orders closely monitored and strictly medicated. Dr. Denis fears this could kill Rantés' unique personality and intellect. The director is unsympathetic and states:
Instead of making the police blotter, Rantés ends up in the front page next time: LUNATIC ORDERS MILITARY ATTACK.
to which Denis quickly retorts (referring to the Malvinas/Falklands War):
¡That already happened, and I doubt Rantés had anything to do with it!
Affected by the medication, Rantés broods and becomes rebellious. He seems tormented by Dr. Denis' lack of involvement, asking, Doctor, why have you abandoned me?. He is also more upset by the mistreatment of other patients. After escaping again, he demands to see the director about the awful quality of the asylum's food, but is turned away. His complaints are also rejected by the local newspaper. Dr. Denis believes that Rantés is disillusioned with mankind and may never recover, but continues the treatment.
Dr. Denis convinces Beatriz to meet at his home and they become passionate about each other and have sex. Then she confides to the Doctor that she is an alien projection, like Rantés, but who now feels emotion and can love him. Dr. Denis is livid and throws her out of his home saying she is a lunatic like Rantés.
After Rantés starts becoming catatonic, the director decides to give him Electroshock treatment without notyfing Denis. Rantés doesn't endure anesthesia and dies after a heart attack. The rest of the patients don't believe in Rantés death, as they all hope that he has only gone back to his ship for some time. From then on the patients keep waiting for Rantés to return and take them away to his planet. At the same time, Denis quietly waits for Beatriz, who is away indefinitely, to return to him.

title: Barbarosa
synopsis: Young Karl Westover (Gary Busey), a pre-Civil War Texas farm boy, accidentally kills his brother-in-law and must flee to Mexico. Early into his flight he is met by the outlaw Barbarosa (Willie Nelson) who, seconds later, kills a man who was following him. It is apparent that Barbarosa knows him, but doesn't say. Despite his disgust that Karl has nothing worth robbing, is loath to leave the poor rube to die in the desert. Barbarosa shows Karl how to find water, make a fire, and catch an armadillo for his supper before leaving him with the advice to go home to Texas.
Karl makes his way to a small pueblo and finds a grubby cantina. He is enjoying his first good meal in a long time and receiving the attentions of his first working girl ever when Barbarosa bursts in and robs everyone at gunpoint. Filling his sombrero with loot, Barbarosa instructs Karl to gather the rest, and steals away while everyone is bemused by Karl's amateurish performance. Nevertheless, Karl escapes, and he and Barbarosa ride together for the winter while Karl learns the life of an outlaw adventurer.
Karl is being pursued by Floyd and Otto Pahmeyer, the brothers of the man he killed, sent by their vengeful father. They are naive farm boys as Karl once was, and Karl and Barbarosa easily get the drop on them. Again to Barbarosa's disgust, Karl leaves them alive and tells them to go home. They say they can't, being more afraid of their father than the banditos. You know how Papa gets, they tell Karl, and hike off to replace their guns and resume the chase.
The banditos encounter a poor old couple with a burro, and (yet again to Barbarosa's disgust) Karl refuses to rob them. Barbarosa and Karl are then captured by the outlaw Angel Morales and his gang, and as Angel is debating what to do with them the old couple, Angel's parents, arrive in camp and reveal great gobs of loot hidden in their burro's pack; Barbarosa tells Karl, Well, I hope you're satisfied! When the old couple tell their story, the enraged Angel shoots Barbarosa in the belly. He spares Karl's life for restraining Barbarosa from robbing his parents, but sets him to digging Barbarosa's grave. When Karl dumps Barbarosa's body in the shallow grave and starts throwing dirt in his face, he sneezes and whispers fiercely, Stop that!; it seems that the bullet was deflected by Barbarosa's big silver belt buckle, and he has been playing dead. Barbarosa scuttles off into the brush when no one is looking, and Karl quickly fills in the empty grave.
Angel's gang capture the hapless Floyd and Otto, and Angel shoots them on a whim, again setting Karl to dig the graves. But in the morning, a stuporous Angel struggles awake to find himself buried to the neck in the desert sand, with the dead heads of Floyd and Otto surrounding him. Terrified, he screams fruitlessly for help and for the author of his demise, Barbaroooooosaaaaaaa!
Even outlaws must have someplace to call home, it seems. Barbarosa has an ongoing love-hate relationship with the Zavala family. He brings his accumulated loot every few months when he visits his loyal wife, Josefina de Zavala (Isela Vega), who lives at the hacienda of her father, Don Braulio Zavala (Gilbert Roland, in his final film). Intensely bitter, Don Braulio hates Barbarosa for crippling him and killing his son in a drunken fracas, and every few years he sends another young Zavala son, nephew, or cousin to kill Barbarosa; none has yet succeeded, and most have been themselves killed in the attempt. Don Braulio's tales, stylized and heavy with symbolism, spur the young Zavalas to their best efforts to be worthy of such an adversary, and the Zavalas have become rich and powerful thereby. The songs recounting Barbarosa's exploits become longer and more celebratory each year, and recent verses also recount the adventures of Barbarosa's new sidekick, the Gringo Child. Yet the chorus between every verse exhorts all you men of courage to grease up your guns and knives . . . this is the part where they kill Barbarosa.
Barbarosa and Josefina have a nubile daughter, Juanita (Alma Martinez), who decides she likes the Gringo Child and hides Karl from searchers in her bed. Interrupted by her parents, Karl is kicked into the plaza by the enraged Barbarosa; the ruckus raises Don Braulio and the household, who rush to the plaza, guns blazing. Barbarosa twirls his Appaloosa horse in the gate, whooping, displaying his horsemanship and courage, and the banditos escape at the gallop amid a hail of bloodless gunplay. And when Karl too shows some backbone, telling Barbarosa that he liked Juanita and intends to visit her again, Barbarosa smiles and says that's fine with him.
In the spring, Barbarosa and Karl decide to return to Texas. Climbing out of the Rio Grande canyon, Karl attempts to lend Barbarosa a hand up the final ledge. Karl is hampered by the saddlebags he is holding so Barbarosa says Get rid of that! To which Karl flings the saddlebags (containing the loot) back over the cliff. Terminally disgusted, Barbarosa yells at him, I didn't say throw the MONEY down THERE! I've BEEN down THERE!!!. Karl makes the aruous climb back down the cliff. He disturbs a rattlesnake and falls into the river. When Karl struggles back to the canyon rim that evening he finds Barbarosa waiting beside a campfire. He dumps the saddlebags of money at Barbarosa's feet, but Barbarosa is still peeved: Bet you didn't bring an armadillo for my supper! But Karl reveals his other hand from behind his back, tossing a dead armadillo into Barbarosa's lap. Both look at each other and laugh; Karl is learning, and starting to give as good as he gets.
Barbarosa and Karl come to the Texas Hill Country and the German immigrant colony where Karl grew up, and ride into a stockmen's rendezvous. While enjoying eating barbecue and watching horse races, Karl mentions that horses are something he knows about and considers buying some broncos to take home to his father's farm. Suddenly a shot rings out—it is old Mr. Pahmeyer (George Voskovec), still seeking to kill Karl for the death of his sons. In his rage, he misses. Karl covers him with his revolver and makes him stop trying to reload. Go home, Mr. Pahmeyer, just go home! he orders, and Mr. Pahmeyer has no choice but to obey.
Karl buys his horses, but Barbarosa declines to accompany him back to lawful living. To tell the truth, I'm worn out keeping you amused, he grumbles. The two part ways as friends.
Karl drives his herd to the farm, finding it very run down, his mother died, himself given up for dead, and his father Emile (Howland Chamberlain) and sister Hilda (Sharon Compton) despondent. He cheers them up, telling them that he had a little luck down in Mexico -- me and another fellow. Next morning Emile steps outside to inspect our horses. OUR horses? jokes Karl. You'd best break a few before it's 'OUR horses'!, and Hilda laughs with them. But their laughter turns to screams as Mr. Pahmeyer takes another potshot from the woods, again missing Karl but killing his father.
Karl goes alone to the Pahmeyer farmhouse, calling Mr. Pahmeyer to come out and end the feud. Mr. Pahmeyer calls back that he is sorry about killing Emile, that he never intended to do that. Karl calls back that he knows that, and again offers to end the feud. But despite the cries of his wife, Mr. Pahmeyer calls, I don't think I can do it! and charges out the door with his gun. Howling, NOOOOO!, Karl is forced to kill him.
Karl and Barbarosa reunite after some time (Karl's beard and hair have grown out). During a brief split, Karl aids Barbarosa in evading Eduardo Zavala (Danny de la Paz), the most recent young would-be killer sent out by Don Braulio. Without Barbarosa's knowledge, he disarms Eduardo and strips him of his guns, his horse, and his boots. WALK home! Git! he orders Eduardo.
But Eduardo is made of sterner stuff than his predecessors. He hones his silver crucifix down to a dagger point, wraps his feet in rawhide thongs, and stalks Barbarosa on foot. He leaps upon Barbarosa from ambush and stabs him in the belly, then flees to the south.
As Karl sits with his dying friend, they discuss Barbarosa's life and death. A man couldn't ask for better than what I had with the Zavalas, Barbarosa says. And then, The little bastard's going back to tell everyone Barbarosa's dead. Barbarosa can't die! Karl realizes, He's afoot! and may be caught before he gets back to the Zavala hacienda.
Karl cremates Barbarosa's body, and pursues Eduardo at the gallop. But Eduardo has learned, and knocks Karl out by hitting him with a branch. Taking Karl's horse, Eduardo makes it back to the hacienda and is greeted as a hero. A fiesta is planned in his honor.
Karl sits beside a campfire, defeated, nursing his headache. There is a rustle in the brush, and out comes Barbarosa's Appaloosa, with Barbarosa's saddle and enormous sombrero. Karl perks up.
The fiesta at the Zavala hacienda is the most funereal party imaginable. Don Braulio Josephina and Jaunita look lost and bereft, the rest of the clan dance while contemplating directionless life without a Barbarosa to fight. Out of the night gallops a red-bearded man in an enormous sombrero on an Appaloosa, whooping and twirling and shooting up the sky. As Eduardo is about to be presented a black wreath of honor, Karl aims and shoots the wreath just before it is placed on his head. The Zavalas shout, Barbarosa! Barbarosa! Barbarosaaaa! and scramble for their guns and knives.
(In the unedited original, Eduardo's announcement of Barbarosa's death to Don Braulio is followed by an angry exchange between the two men. The exchange reveals that Don Braulio has been using Barbarosa as a family demon to strengthen the family. Don Braulio is angry that Barbarosa is dead. Eduardo is angry that he, and all men sent out before him, were used by Don Braulio. They agree to continue the facade and plans for a festival are made. Without this normally edited scene the acceptance of Barbarosa's reappearance by Don Braulio and Eduardo makes no sense.)

title: Blackadder: The Cavalier Years
synopsis: The episode begins in November 1648. King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland has already lost the Civil War. Only two men remain loyal to him: Sir Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), the sole descendant of the Blackadder dynasty at the time, and his servant Baldrick Esq (Tony Robinson). They have given refuge to the King in Blackadder Hall, where he is hiding in a thorn bush, having assured him that he is as likely to be caught as a fox being chased by a pack of one-legged hunting tortoises. Sir Edmund remains loyal because as a known royalist he sees the King's survival as his only hope of survival. He also fears the spread of Puritanism, full of moral prohibitions (as he describes it, the Puritans will close all the theatres, lace handkerchiefs for men will be illegal, and I won't have a friendly face to sit on this side of Boulogne!). During Sir Edmund's short absence, Oliver Cromwell (Warren Clarke) himself arrives at Blackadder Hall, accompanied by a number of his Roundheads — supporters of the Parliament of England. Baldrick attempts to deny knowing the King's whereabouts, but blows the gaff when he asks Cromwell later to put down a cup, because it's the king's.
The second scene takes place in the Tower of London, two weeks later. King Charles's prayers are interrupted by two subsequent visits. The first is from Cromwell who warns him of his doom and the second by Sir Edmund, disguised as a priest. He informs the King that he is planning the King's escape. While Sir Edmund is still there, the King receives a notice that he has been sentenced to death. (This occurs in late November or early December 1648 within the context of this episode, though historically the death sentence came on 27 January 1649.)
As 29 January 1649 arrives and his execution approaches, King Charles is again visited by Sir Edmund. Though his plans for an escape have not materialised, he informs the King that there is still some hope. The Parliament has yet to find a man willing to be the King's executioner. Charles, rather philosophically, proclaims that he isn't looking forward to his execution but It's a question of balance, isn't it? Like so many other things (Charles, played by Stephen Fry, is very much a pastiche of his modern day namesake the Prince of Wales). Sir Edmund proceeds to assure Charles that no one would dare to become the King's executioner. Just as he says that, the King receives a notice that they found his executioner.
Back at Blackadder Hall, Baldrick is singing happily as Sir Edmund proclaims his life to be in ruins. While Baldrick informs him that he has accepted a job, Sir Edmund wonders who could be so utterly without heart and soul, so low and degraded, as to behead the King of England. As his own words sink in, he questions Baldrick, who admits that it was he who accepted the position. (Historically King Charles' executioner was Richard Brandon.) Baldrick explains to the understandably enraged Blackadder that he has a cunning plan to save the King. He presents Sir Edmund with a huge pumpkin, poorly painted to represent a human face. He plans to place it on the King's head and chop it instead. Sir Edmund dismisses the plan, as Baldrick will have to hold the monarch's head in front of the crowd, and criticises Baldrick's stupidity (Your head is as empty as a eunuch's underpants). Baldrick, though saddened, says that at least the money, £1000, is good. At this, Sir Edmund's greed awakens, and he proceeds to take the money from Baldrick, announcing that he will replace him as the executioner, saying it needs somebody who actually has an axe. (From this point Sir Edmund, who has hitherto shown uncharacteristic touches of conscience, behaves like a typical Blackadder.)
30 January 1649, King Charles' day of execution, arrives. King Charles is left alone for a few minutes with his executioner (Sir Edmund in a hood and with a false voice). Sir Edmund takes advantage of these minutes to relieve the King of his remaining wealth: however, the King eventually recognises him, but mistakes Blackadder's intentions and congratulates him for trying to save him even at the last minute, before giving him custody of his infant son, the later King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland. (Historically he was 19 years old at the time of his father's death.) As he cannot explain his betrayal to the King, Sir Edmund panics and uses the plan that Baldrick had suggested earlier. The camera then focuses on Baldrick, who is listening to the sounds of the execution. Sir Edmund chops the pumpkin and proclaims that This is the head of a traitor. Predictably enough, the crowd answers him, No, it's not! It's a huge pumpkin with a pathetic moustache drawn on it!. Sir Edmund apologises and says he will try again. Baldrick continues to listen as Sir Edmund Blackadder beheads King Charles I and the crowd cheers.
As the last scene begins, Sir Edmund and Baldrick have returned to Blackadder Hall. A disgusted Blackadder cradles the infant Charles in his hands. Baldrick tries to console him by saying that at least he tried and that now the future of the British monarchy lies fast asleep in his arms in the person of this infant prince. He suggests to his master that he should be ready to escape to France, because as a known Royalist he is in danger of being arrested by the Roundheads and beheaded. Sir Edmund, who apparently had forgotten that he is in danger, immediately rises from his seat, ready to take action. But it is too late; Roundheads are already at the Hall's doors demanding his surrender. Sir Edmund explains to Baldrick that there is no choice for a man of honour but to stand and fight, and die in defence of his future sovereign. However, as a Blackadder, he was never a man of honour. Passing the prince to Baldrick, he proceeds to remove his long black hair (which was apparently a wig), his false moustache and beard, to reveal a Roundhead appearance – short blond hair and a clean-shaven face. Thus unrecognisable, when Cromwell enters the room he denounces Baldrick as royalist scum. The episode ends with a hapless Baldrick, still holding the Prince in his arms, being approached by Cromwell, sword drawn.

title: Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown
synopsis: Linus is fond of his teacher, Miss Othmar. To prove his point, he buys her a huge heart-shaped box of chocolates. However, Violet warns him it is probably not smart to fall in love with a teacher. But Linus says that he is fond of the ground she walks on. When he leaves Sally believes that Linus bought the candy for her, and decides to make him a valentine in return. Later, Lucy goes to a puppet show held by Snoopy. At the concession stand, Lucy asks for popcorn. However, because Snoopy cannot understand Lucy he gives her candy, then soda, and finally (as having been requesting all along) popcorn. With Charlie Brown narrating the show, Snoopy tells a story about true lovers that is a little too interactive for Lucy's taste.
Valentine's Day then comes and the gang brings valentine cards for everybody. At Birchwood School, Schroeder explains a box labelled VALENTINES FOR THOSE WE LOVE with a slot for putting the cards in. Charlie Brown brings a briefcase hoping he will get lots of valentines. However, after the cards are passed out, it turns out Charlie Brown got none except for a very small candy heart reading Forget It Kid. Linus also never gave his candy to Miss Othmar because she left with her boyfriend. Sally who still believes the box of candy is for her, is dismayed when he attempts to go after the teacher to give her the candy. Charlie Brown and Linus vent their heartbreak in different ways: Linus throws his chocolates off a bridge (This one is for love! This one is for valentines! This one is for romance...!), not knowing that Snoopy and Woodstock are under it, catching and eating every chocolate he throws off; Charlie Brown kicks his mailbox, only to have Snoopy pop out of it and kiss him. (I hate Valentine's Day! Charlie Brown says). The next day, Violet gives Charlie Brown a used valentine (she struck her own name from it) as an apology, despite Schroder berating her for dropping by the day after Valentine's Day and acting out of guilt. (Don't listen to him; I'll take it! Charlie Brown says). As Charlie Brown and Linus meet at the brick wall later, Charlie Brown expresses hope that Violet's pity valentine will start a trend, and he will get even more valentines the following year.

title: Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid
synopsis: The cartoon begins with a mother buzzard instructing her children to go out and catch something for dinner. They set off right away except one with his back turned. This is Beaky Buzzard (Killer) who is shy and a little on the slow side. Against his will, his mother kicks him out of the nest with instructions to at least catch a rabbit. Beaky spots Bugs Bunny and soars down to catch him. Bugs makes like an air-traffic controller and guides Beaky to the ground with a crash.
After some heckling, a chase ensues ending with Bugs crashing into the ground underneath the skeleton of a dead animal. He cries because he thinks he's dead (Gruesome, isn't it?, he briefly confides to the audience), but it turns out he knew he was okay the whole time (because his feet was sticking out of the ground). Beaky and Bugs jitterbug together. Bugs says, Why don't we do this more often, to which Beaky replies, Ya mean just what we're doing tonight? This is a quote of the first line of the song Why Don't We Do This More Often? After the dance with Bugs, Beaky ends up underground with the skeleton above. He screams Oh, MA! and his mother shows up. At first the mother buzzard thinks Bugs did something to Beaky. Bugs pulls Beaky out of the ground. Noticing that Beaky is unharmed, the mother abandons her desire to eat Bugs and declares him her hero and kisses him. A blushing Bugs imitates Beaky.

title: Mouse Trouble
synopsis: A mailman delivers a box in the mailbox. Tom opens the box and finds a book on how to catch mice and for the rest of the cartoon, he takes its advice to attempt to catch the mouse (Jerry).
The first thing the book suggests is to locate the mouse. Tom locates the mouse, but when he tries to grab Jerry, the mouse steps off the book and slams Tom's nose in it.
Tom sets out a simple mouse trap and tests it by snapping it by touching it with a feather. Jerry, however, succeeds in freeing the cheese from it without setting off the trap. Shocked at the trap's failure, Tom tests it, and the trap snaps as soon as he touches it, causing him to scream in pain. Tom then sets a snare trap around a piece of cheese and gets ready to pull the string but Jerry sneakily replaces the cheese with a bowl of cream. When Tom peeks back at the trap, he sees the cream and drinks it, completely distracted by it as Jerry activates the trap, sending the cat out to the tree himself.
Tom's next attempt at catching Jerry is to guffaw while reading the book. A curious Jerry ventures out of his hole and Tom eventually captures Jerry by shutting him into the book. But when Tom grabs him, Jerry pulls the same trick on him with his fists. Tom inspects them only to get punched in the eye and leaving Jerry to escape. (This trick was pulled again in Safety Second.) After reading in the book that A Cornered Mouse NEVER FIGHTS, Tom pounces onto Jerry, but Jerry fights back and beats Tom offscreen. Afterwards, Tom, now bruised and battered, drones Don't you believe it! - a cultural reference to the distinctive jingle on the 1940s radio show Don't You Believe it! (Voiced by Harry E. Lang.) (This was repeated at the conclusion of the episode The Missing Mouse).
At this point, Tom stops reading from chapter-to-chapter and skims the book, trying suggestions that he likes or thinks one of them will work. Upon reading Chapter VII: Be scientific in your approach, Tom uses a stethoscope to listen for Jerry within the walls of the house. This backfires when Jerry screams into the microphone, almost deafening Tom. Tom then forces a double-barreled shotgun into Jerry's mousehole. However, the barrels of the gun bend upwards, protrude out of the wall and point straight at Tom's head as the cat fires and ends up shooting himself in the head, rendering himself bald.
In the next scene, Tom, wearing a dodgy, orange toupée, sets a bear trap and sticks it inside Jerry's hole. Jerry walks outside from another hole behind Tom and puts then trap behind him. Just as Tom sits down, the trap triggers. Tom screams in pain and is sent up into the ceiling. Tom then tries to use a mallet to flatten Jerry. Jerry pops out of a hole behind a picture right above Tom, grabs the mallet, and hits him, knocking him out.
Tom then attempts to hide inside a large gift box before knocking on Jerry's wall. Jerry, seeing the box, knocks on it. With no response, Jerry returns with a bunch of pins and sticks them inside the box while Tom whimpers in pain before sawing the box in half. Hearing nothing inside, Jerry looks inside the box, and in horror, he gulps and displays a sign reading IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?
Now covered in bandages (including one wrapped around his bisected torso), Tom reads the twelfth chapter of the book, Mice are Suckers for Dames, which makes him wind up a female toy mouse which repeatedly says come up and see me some time. Jerry, noticing the toy, walks with it. Tom attempts to lure Jerry into a mouse-sized pretend hotel which is named cozy arms, the door of which leads into Tom's open mouth. But to Tom's dismay, Jerry ushers the toy mouse into the hotel first, which causes Tom to eat it and breaking it (shattering his teeth in the process). After hiccuping twice (which triggers the swallowed toy's voicebox), Tom looks at his decrepit teeth in a mirror. This infuriates the cat as he shatters the mirror and angrily rips off and destroys the book.
Tom goes insane and gets revenge by attempting to blow away Jerry with dozens of explosives (TNT, gunpowder, dynamite and a massive block buster that resembles the atom bomb Fat Man). When Tom ignites a piece of dynamite cautiously, it doesn't start the fuse enough, so he blows the fuse too hard. This causes the fuse to be fired immediately, and explosives erupt, killing Tom. Nothing at all remains of the house except Jerry (who remains unharmed after the explosion) and the part of his mousehole, while a fed-up Tom, this time with a spirit form, is seen on a cloud floating to heaven with a harp and a halo, all the while, repeatedly hiccuping come up and see me some time ad infinitum.

title: Isle of Forgotten Sins
synopsis: === At the Isle of Forgotten Sins ===
Somewhere on one of the English-speaking South Sea Islands, at an indefinite present time, with no mention of the fact that it is the middle of World War II, Marge (Gale Sondergaard) is the proprietress of a nightclub/restaurant/gambling hall/brothel called Isle of Forgotten Sins. In the morning, she knocks on the doors of the individual rooms of her sleeping hostesses, Olga (Betty Amann), Bobbie (Patti McCarty), Mimi (Marian Colby), and Christine (Tala Birell) announcing, get up, the Southern Queen is here. Riding in a launch from the ship is an inspector from the Criminal Investigation Bureau who compares a fingerprint card with a photograph of Betty Nelson to one with a photo of a somewhat older Marge Williams, shows it to the commissioner (unbilled C. Montague Shaw) and tells him, we'll go there tonight. Marge, surrounded by eight hostesses, is asked by one, what can we do to please him? and answers, he doesn't want to be pleased, he's looking for an excuse to close us up. As the sarong-clad girls leave, one of them, Diane (Rita Quigley) tells Marge, oh, I suppose it's silly of me but I feel so self-conscious in this costume and Marge responds, I know how it is when your modesty's taking a beating, don't let it get you down.
=== On Burke's boat ===
On a small boat moored in the harbor, its owner, deep sea diver Jack Burke (Frank Fenton), is shaving in preparation of visiting Marge's place, while his diving partner/friendly rival Mike Clancy (John Carradine) awakens from drunken sleep to find that Burke has tied him to the bunk bed. He offers to pay for drinks if Burke unties him, but Burke wants to see the cash first. Clancy tells him that it's in his pocket, so Burke reaches in, takes all of it, and leaves without untying him, as Clancy shouts angrily and struggles to loosen the bonds.
=== The Isle in turmoil ===
The inspector and the commissioner arrive at Marge's and, after having been seated at their table, the commissioner says, don't look so disappointed, you'll see murder and mayhem any moment now and the inspector answers, I [it?] wouldn't surprise me any. Mimi comes out to sing In Pango [by Leo Erdody and Ann Levitt] (I roamed all the world seeking gladness, but found in my heart only sadness) accompanied by two guitarists, a percussionist and a female accordionist. At another table, Krogan (Sidney Toler) is sitting with Johnny Pacific (Rick Vallin) and, when Diane serves them drinks, tries to grab her bare arm. As she pulls away, he laughs unpleasantly while, observing disapprovingly from his table, the inspector comments, rather unusual there. When Burke enters, Krogan tells Johnny Pacific, the other will be showing up any minute now, when Burke hits this port, Clancy's never far behind. Burke is waiting for Marge in her upstairs room, explaining that Clancy drowned and giving her the pocket watch she once gifted to Clancy.
Meanwhile, Clancy enters and asks Christine, where's Marge?, while in her upstairs office, Marge tells Burke that since Mike Clancy was the reason she stayed, she'll be leaving and Burke suggests, that with Mike gone, you might marry me. Before she can answer, Clancy knocks on the door and, as the astonished and relieved Marge tells him what happened, asks her to step outside, and starts trading punches with Burke. The fistfight progresses from Marge's room to the downstairs dining area, as tables and chairs are broken and overturned. Clancy ultimately knocks out Burke and is proclaimed as the winner by Krogan, who tells everybody, The drinks are on me, as all the disarranged diners smile and break into happy applause. Krogan continues, I have another little treat for you, explaining that a nameless young man whom I fished out of the sea so I called him Johnny Pacific will entertain. Johnny Pacific goes to the piano and plays the second movement (Adagio cantabile) of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 (the Pathétique) and, while the familiar classical theme continues to be heard in the background, Clancy deals with Burke who regains consciousness and starts swinging fists, by telling him that he recognized Krogan and Johnny Pacific as the captain and purser of the steamship Tropic Star which, six months earlier, disappeared in the Coral Sea with three million dollars in gold, and that they must have hidden the loot, but we can find it first. Burke agrees and Marge gives Clancy the money to finance the expedition, but just after he and Burke leave her place, a scream is heard from upstairs, then a shot, and a customer (unbilled I. Stanford Jolley) staggers out and falls from the upper landing. Olga, holding a gun, runs downstairs in front of everybody and then up another staircase. The dying man blurts out, that girl, she took my money, to the inspector, who announces that I am placing you all under technical arrest as material witnesses. As Krogan, Johnny Pacific and the diners rush for the exits, Marge tells the girls that we're between the devil and the deep and that's no quotation, as they grab money from the cash register and head for Burke's boat.
=== Hurried departure ===
Alone on the boat, as they prepare to leave port, Clancy tells Burke, there'll be so much money for both of us, there'll be no reason for us to doublecross each other and sings, when whisky comes near my nose, Whisky Johnny. in the midst of their parting drink, Marge, Diane, Christine and Bobbie descend into the hold with Marge announcing that Olga closed up for us — for keeps, as Christine adds, sure, she's only murdered the guy. Burke refuses to get involved, but Clancy says that he'll cut them in if they help with getting the gold. Burke raises his fists for another brawl, but Marge breaks a bottle over his head, knocking him out. Clancy tells the three crewmen to cast off and goes back downstairs as Burke regains consciousness and quickly agrees to include the girls in the deal. The plan, as explained by Clancy, is to arrive at Marana island, where Krogan and Johnny Pacific are running a plantation, and take the gold for themselves, with the six of them sharing half a million each. Diane refuses to participate based on her moral principles, but Olga, who apparently followed them to the boat and hid until now, steps out and announces that I'm cutting myself in for her share. Burke says let's put her over the side, with Clancy adding good idea, but Olga pulls out a gun, stating, I've already shot one man tonight in self-defense, you better play nice with me if you want to get your hands on that gold and, in another quick agreement, Clancy says, all right, we'll cut you in for a share.
=== On Krogan's island ===
The boat comes close to Marana island and the arrival is noted through binoculars by Krogan who tells Johnny Pacific that our little game of hide and seek is about to begin. They explain to native girl Luana (Veda Ann Borg), who lives with them, that two very much bad men come in that boat, they try to find our gold, where we hide it, with Krogan adding, lotta fun is when we take it away from them. Clancy, Burke and the five women arrive at Krogan's house, with Marge explaining to Krogan that things got too hot for us at Pango Ango after what happened and asking if he could put us up for a few days until we can make other plans. Krogan replies that they've arranged a little party of welcome for tonight.
As night comes and a full moon shines over the lagoon, Luana leans against a tree and sings, Sleepy Island Moon [by Leo Erdody and June L. Stillman] (accompanied by orchestral music and an unseen chorus of male and female voices) as a man and a woman are seen rhythmically swimming back and forth through the lagoon. At the end of Luana's song, Marge says that this part is beginning to remind me of an old nursery rhyme: mother may I go out to swim? Yes, my darling daughter, hang your clothes on a hickory limb, but don't go near the water. As the girls, Krogan and Johnny Pacific go for a night swim, Clancy kicks Burke, who wanted to swim with Luana, and tells him that now's our chance to frisk the house. In the meantime, Krogan and Johnny Pacific, while swimming with the girls, guide them to a view of a spectacular underwater cave, hidden just a few feet beneath the lagoon. Searching the house, Clancy points out to Burke the Tropic Star log, with a map, which indicates that the gold is still underwater on the ship, waiting to be salvaged. As Krogan and the girls come out of the water, Clancy and Burke are lounging on the shore, commenting that they'll be leaving in the morning. In the house, Krogan shows Johnny Pacific the place in log where Clancy tore out the map and says that it didn't take him long to smell out the bait, while Johnny Pacific comments that he must be awful dumb to fall for anything as phony as a treasure map.
The next morning, Marge and Diane visit Clancy and Burke on the boat, as they prepare to look for the gold and Burke tells Clancy that Luana sort of grows on you. However, Krogan, Johnny Pacific and Luana are observing the situation from the island, with Krogan commenting that a couple of expert divers like Burke and Clancy oughta do the job in half a dozen trips and as soon as the gold is brought up, five of my best boys will be on the job at dawn.
On the boat, Clancy again sings Whisky Johnny (now I got a gal, her name is Lize, for she put whisky in her pies), as they examine their air hoses and prepare to take turns in putting on the diving suits and going down with the help of their three crewmen. As Burke descends, accompanied by the sound of Wagnerian choirs, Clancy says, give my regards to Mrs. Jones. Burke finds the Tropic Star and, back on the boat, Clancy tell him that the barometer's been dropping steadily all the time you were down, looks like we're in for a blow. Meanwhile, on the island, Luana jealously accuses Johnny Pacific of infidelity and their loud quarrel brings Krogan, who calms the situation, but then a native runs in with some disturbing news. The girls grow uneasy and Christine says, yeah, there's something in the air that makes you feel that something's going to happen. A native chief (William Edmonds) arrives at the house and tells Krogan, much bad magic now in sky and sea, explaining that big wave ready to walk some more and pointing at Rorschach test-like formations of threatening black skies, advises everyone to leave the island. After he departs, Krogan and Johnny Pacific take guns and go off, telling the girls to be careful about tigers which are still occasionally spotted since these islands at one time were a part of Asia.
=== Gold, greed and monsoon ===
During his underwater descent, in a diving suit, Clancy's voice is heard on the boat, the agitation of the water will be due to my hearty laughter. More loud choral singing (the diver diving down below), accompanied by music, is heard as Clancy walks on the sea bottom . He finds the gold, while, on the island, Krogan and Johnny Pacific are watching through binoculars. Clancy pretends to be in distress so that Burke would bring him up before the gold and, as the trunk full of bullion is aboard and below the deck, Burke gives a few gold bars to the crewmen and tells them to divide it among themselves and then announces to Clancy that he is claiming 60 percent of the loot because he provided the boat and the crew. Clancy protests and they start a violent struggle during which Krogan, Johnny Pacific and their men board the boat, with Krogan pointing his gun and ordering them to stick 'em up and continuing, you guys tried to steal our gold, you're not gonna get away with it. Locking them in the boat's back room, Johnny Pacific nails the door shut and tells them I'm building a nice coffin for you guys and adds, so long boys, hope you enjoy your nice dive to Davy Jones' Locker. As they board their small launch, Krogan and Johnny Pacific light a fuse to explosives which they attached to Burke's boat. Seconds before the boat explodes, Clancy and Burke manage to kick the door open and jump off into the water. Ominous choirs are heard intoning as the black skies give way to high winds and tall waves.
Krogan, Johnny Pacific and the five natives return to the island and walk through the ever-increasing storm, reaching the house as the waves are lapping at its edges. Krogan says, well, any of you gals ever see what three million dollars looks like. Olga and Luana excitedly approach the trunk, while Marge, Diane, Christine and Bobbie warily stand back. Krogan continues, there, take a look, isn't that beautiful, three million dollars in gold, think of all the luxuries that'll buy. Marge asks what happened to Clancy and Krogan answers that you want to see them, you've got to get yourself a diving suit, because they're down at the bottom of the lagoon, along with the Tropic Star. Johnny Pacific tells the four women that you gambled on the wrong team so you get nothing. Olga protests that I was playing on your team, but he replies that you didn't tell us a thing we didn't know and Krogan adds, we figured Burke and Clancy had enough larceny in their hearts not to put the finger on us and tells Olga, I'll pay your fare to the mainland, if you keep out of my sight, that's more than you deserve. Olga then reaches in the back of her sarong, points a gun at Krogan and orders him to start dishing out my share of those sacks, but he calmly says, go on and shoot and, as she pulls the trigger, the gun only clicks. Krogan lets out his familiar laugh and tells her, you see, I remembered your fine habit about shooting people, so I had Luana take all the cartridges out of your gun and hits her across the face, making her fall, and then continues, you're all a lot of dirty double-crossing rats, all of you, except Diane, she's the only decent one among you. Turning to Johnny Pacific and Luana, he says, and that goes for you too, accusing them of planning to double-cross him. Johnny Pacific pulls out his gun and they shoot simultaneously, killing each other. Just then, Clancy enters with Burke, commenting, nice shootin', boys, now that's what I call being pals. Luana points a gun at them, but Burke takes it away from her and pulls her towards him, take it easy babe. As Clancy proclaims, Marge we're rich, the winds hit the thatched house which is then washed away by the surging waves. Clancy and Marge are in the sea as he tries to keep her afloat, but both are swamped by a new surge.
=== Coda ===
An overhead sign marks the entrance to The Bird Cage Cafe. Inside, as dance music plays, Marge is seated at the side bar cash register, with what appears to be a large framed photograph of Diane and Burke as a happy couple, propped up against it, while Clancy, wearing a captain's cap and jacket, surveys the place, then sits by her and says, I'll have to put the bite on you for about fifty dollars, explaining that he'll tell her more later, adding, you haven't forgotten about that bundle on the Riviera, have you? She gives him the money and rings up NO SALE.

title: Boo
synopsis: The film starts with a man (Morton Lowry) reading the novel Dracula . The narrator says that they are presenting their own formula for cheap entertainment, a nightmare. They say to eat a real lobster, not the kind they send to congress, have milk, and work up a chill. The man falls asleep.
They then go to a cellar (edited from Nosferatu) where the caretaker Hutter (Gustav von Wagenheim) is making sure all the ghosts are locked up for the night. He sees a coffin. He wants to ask his name and how he feels. It's Dracula (Count Orlok, played by Max Schrek). The caretaker tries to leave, but he keeps coming back. He can't sleep so he sleeps in a hammock (now edited of Albert Venohr). You see Dracula, so the caretaker goes upstairs and returns with a hatchet (now edited of Wolfgang Heinz) and breaks Dracula's coffin. It hurts Dracula, causing him to get up. He then leaves, and sees if it was as close as he thought. He is scared, and Dracula sucks his blood, 'Gush, Gush'. Dracula then goes to sleep for 100 years, until congress does something about the depression.
It then goes to a laboratory (edited from Frankenstein) where a Doctor (Edward Van Sloan) is doing something to The Monster (Boris Karloff). The Monster awakes, and kills the Doctor. The Monster gets together with Dracula, and is afraid of him.
It then goes to Annabelle West (Helen Twelvetrees) and a possibility of this becoming pleasant. But The Monster is there. A man is telling Helen she has no business being in the same nightmare as Dracula. Dracula is behind him, and brings him behind a bookshelf. The Monster is studying Dracula's methods. Helen sees a guy who keeps falling down. The Monster appears, and Helen faints.
Dracula's income tax was due and he had to get some money. When night came, Helen decided to call it a day. Dracula stole Helen's jewels. Helen is ticklish on the neck, woke up, screamed, and told a young man about what happened. He wants to see a ghost, but gets caught and his blood is sucked by Dracula. Helen can never get married, because when she talks to a guy Dracula gets him, so she'd be a widow every 15 minutes. Dracula then chases a woman. He's in disguise, but you can recognize him by the fourth toe on his left foot. The Monster decides to chase Elizabeth, (Mae Clarke from Frankenstein) who is about to get married. She first is terrified. It then turns into follow the leader, then into ring around the rosy. Her fiancee would think she's nutty. She tells The Monster she can't play anymore because she's got to get married.
The Monster is heart-broken nobody's afraid of him. He has to sit down all day, because when he stands up, his feet touch the floor. He then sees something, and he gets up. What is it? Why it's our lobster and milk friend and he's on a chandelier. And the moral of the story is you can milk a cow, but a lobster is very ticklish.

title: The Nature of the Beast
synopsis: The story is set in Southern California in July 1993.
Jack Powell is a businessman with a wife and kids who live in San Diego. He's on his way home, when he pulls over to the side of the road to check out a crime scene. The sheriff tells him a cut-up body has been found stuffed into the trunk of a Chrysler, and advises him not to stop, nor make any new friends. A policemen slams the trunk, revealing a name has been etched across the top: Hatchet Man.
Further down the road, Jack comes upon a hitchhiker, but keeps on going.
Jack stops at a diner, and runs into the same man, who introduces himself as Adrian. Jack apologizes for not stopping earlier, and offers to buy Adrian lunch. Adrian soon nicknames their waitress, Patsy, Jingle Bells, because of the silver bracelets she wears on one wrist.
Patsy talks excitedly about a briefcase full of $1.25 million in mob money which was stolen from a Las Vegas casino the previous day. Jack looks around nervously and slides his briefcase underneath the table. Adrian tells Jack he's very intuitive about people he meets, and can usually tell all he needs to know about someone within a couple of minutes of meeting them.
For example, is the person a loser, or was he a football star, or, perhaps class president. Jack doesn't seem convinced before Adrian asks him what he's got in his briefcase.
When Adrian gets up to make a move on Patsy in the kitchen, Jack ditches him and makes his escape.
As Jack drives down the highway, he listens to a radio newscaster recount the story of the stolen briefcase and discusses a string of murders in which all the victims have been dismembered. Jack is forced to turn back because a roadblock has been set up to cordon off a chemical spill.
Jack checks into a motel. In the middle of the night, Jack awakes, and walks outside his room to investigate another crime scene, this one located behind the diner where he and Adrian had lunch that day. He sees a severed arm with a silver bracelets placed into a bag and Adrian hiding in the shadows.
Adrian joins Jack in his motel room and shoots up in the bathroom. When it seems Adrian is unconscious, Jack tries to leave him again, but despite repeated and increasingly frantic attempts his car won't start.
Adrian stumbles out of the motel and reveals he's removed the plugs from Jack's car, and tells Jack in no uncertain terms not to leave again, or I'll tell on you, Jack. I'll call the police.
The next morning, Jack and Adrian take to the road together. At a gas station, they meet a young hippie couple named Gerald and Dahlia, who are traveling cross-country in a Dodge van. Adrian wants to hang out with the hippies, but Jack insists they keep going. They stop at a service station so Jack can have a busted water hose on his car replaced. As Jack deals with the attendant, Adrian browses a pet store called the Creepy Crawly Zoo. The owner, Harliss, shows Adrian a Gila Monster, which uses its viselike bite to inject a neurotoxin into the bloodstream. Back in the car, with Jack behind the wheel, Adrian uses the Gila Monster to reassert his power over Jack by throwing the monster onto Jacks lap while he drives. Jack struggles to maintain his composure, and appears frozen by fear and anxiety. To compound matters, Adrian then slams his foot onto the accelerator and the car almost loses control at speed and eventually shudders to a grinding halt before Adrian lets the Gila monster go, and warns Jack on his previous disobedience, and tells Jack he is one crazy motherfucker
Jack and Adrian spend that night at a campsite, where they once again run into Gerald and Dahlia. Adrian gets high with the young couple while Jack broods outside the van. Adrian accuses Jack of trying to scare the hippies off.
Later, Jack finds Adrian having sex with Dahlia in the back of the van while Gerald watches. Jack gets drunk and retires. Adrian shows up later and goads him. After Jack and Adrian drive away in the morning, a shot of the van shows blood smeared down the license plate and the name Hatchet Man etched across the back doors.
The following night, Jack and Adrian stay at a secluded cabin Jack inherited. For the first time, we see the money was stolen from the Vegas casino, as Jack and Adrian use it to play poker.
Adrian prepares to shoot up again, as Jack lectures him about his drug problem. Adrian slaps Jack around, and accuses him of being an alcoholic and a hypocrite. Adrian releases Jack from his grip and returns to his drugs whilst advising Jack to do the same with his drink. Jack reacts by beating Adrian from behind with his briefcase, taping him to a chair and injecting him with a deadly mixture of alcohol and drugs. Adrian convulses and appears to expire, and Jack buries him in a shallow grave.
Sheriff Gordon and his deputy, Little David show up to check on Jack, and over their shoulders Jack can see Adrian rising from the grave. The policemen are called away on a domestic disturbance and leave without noticing Adrian. Jack attempts to gun him down. After he's unloaded his shotgun, Adrian emerges from the shadows. When Adrian pleads with Jack as to why he cuts up the bodies into tiny little pieces, Jack removes a hatchet from his briefcase, and now in a far more confident baritone than he has displayed at any point in the film announces, For the fuck of it, and as the screen fades to black we are left only with the sounds of a violent struggle and left to conclude Jack has killed Adrian once and for all.
Jack returns home to San Diego and kisses his wife, Carol. The paperboy greets him and he replies cheerfully, Say, hey, Billy. As the film fades to black, a quote from the Book of Jeremiah appears on the screen: The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it? This echoes an earlier statement made by Adrian, who said that human beings are essentially unknowable.

title: Legal Eagles
synopsis: Tom Logan (Robert Redford) is an Assistant District Attorney in the New York City District Attorney's Office, who is on his way to becoming the new District Attorney. Into his life enters Laura Kelly (Debra Winger), an attorney who is representing Chelsea Deardon (Daryl Hannah). Chelsea is accused of stealing a painting from millionaire Mr. Forrester (John McMartin). However, Chelsea claims that the painting is actually hers, as her father made it for her and signed it to her on her 8th birthday 18 years ago – the same day that her father and most of his paintings went up in smoke in a mysterious fire.
Kelly eventually manages to talk Logan into helping them (after she creates an impromptu press conference at the dinner where Logan is being introduced as the new candidate for District Attorney). However, things turn even more mysterious when Forrester suddenly drops all charges against Chelsea since he has swapped the painting for a Picasso with museum curator Victor Taft (Terence Stamp), Kelly and Logan find out about this after they go to Forrester's house to ask him about the alleged crime. That night police detective Cavanaugh (Brian Dennehy) comes up with proof that the paintings that supposedly were lost in the fire—which were worth millions in insurance—are still in existence and that Chelsea's father was murdered and the murder was covered up, something which he claims put a strain on his career since it was his investigation. Chelsea also continues coming on to Logan, coming to his apartment being fearful of someone following her. When Logan goes to investigate, he is shot at but the shooter misses and escapes. Logan agrees to continue trying to protect Chelsea while Kelly and him continue her investigation into the paintings. After an attempt by Taft to blow up a warehouse with incriminating information—which almost blows Logan and Kelly up as well—Logan and Kelly find evidence of a massive insurance fraud between Taft, Deardon and Joe Brock, a third man who was sent to prison.
Chelsea goes to Taft's apartment with a gun, with the intent to threaten him and obtain information. What happens then is not seen but Chelsea goes back to Logan's apartment after being there. She tells him what she had done, claims that Taft managed to get the gun from her and hit her and she is now afraid of the repercussions. Logan's daughter from his ex-wife, Jennifer (Jennifer Dundas), is there and does not take kindly to her which leads her to worsen Logan's ex-wife's view on what is actually happening when she comes to take their daughter to her home and finds Chelsea in Logan's apartment. After they are alone Logan makes Chelsea a bed for her to sleep on her own but during the night Chelsea goes into Logan's bed and he fails to resist, they sleep together. Next morning police bust into Logan's room waking both up and arresting Chelsea for Taft's murder. Logan's career as an Assistant District Attorney is finished. Logan reluctantly teams up with Kelly, which is also encouraged by Logan's daughter who thinks the two make a good couple. Realizing that a sculpture Taft claimed to them was priceless but told Chelsea was worthless, Logan goes to find Cavanaugh while Kelly and Chelsea go to an exposition in honor of Taft to find the sculpture. Before they can make it far an assassin tries to run them over with a car, saving Kelly the lawyers split ways long enough for Logan to go on his way pursuing the assassin who fights back but fails to kill Logan since he is hit by a taxi, taking this opportunity Logan steals the man's wallet with information he had taken from them through a bug while Kelly comes to his rescue in Logan's car that she barely manages to drive there since she does not know how to drive. They split again with Logan going to the police department to find Cavanaugh and have him bring the police force while Kelly and Chelsea go to Taft's museum where the exposition in his honor is being held. There, the person they thought was Cavanaugh reveals himself as Joe Brock, Logan finds out on his own since the real Cavanaugh is a different man, a cop that wasn't aware that someone had been using his identity. Logan, having realized that Cavanaugh was not who he thought he was, races to the gallery. Brock forces Kelly and Chelsea to break open the hollow sculpture, grabs the painting inside and cuffs Chelsea to a table while struggling with Kelly, eventually leaving her unconscious. He then sets fire to another part of the gallery, forcing an evacuation as a way to leave with the painting and without anyone noticing. Logan arrives and interrupts Brock's escape, Logan and Brock fight, with Brock eventually falling to his death. Logan finds Kelly and Chelsea, grabs the painting and the three escape from the burning gallery, where Chelsea tearfully reveals the signature To Chelsea on the back of the painting. After all charges against Chelsea are dropped, Logan's former boss offers to take him back, based on Logan's publicity. Logan, however, decides to stay with Kelly, and the two set up an office together.
=== Tom Logan's speech to the jury ===
Tom Logan: Ladies and gentlemen, Chelsea Deardon didn't kill Victor Taft. The prosecution has suggested a possible motive, but one based on hearsay, conjecture and circumstantial evidence. Evidence that appears to have some substance, but upon closer examination, will prove to have no relevance whatsoever to this case.
(Logan stops and looks at the jury)
Tom Logan: You're not buying this, are you? You're not listening to a word I'm saying. Yeah? Guess what? I don't blame you. After listening to Mr. Blanchard lay out the prosecution's evidence, even I'm convinced my client murdered Victor Taft.
(There are murmurs of surprise in the courtroom.)
Tom Logan: After all, if I had found Victor Taft, dead on the floor, and Chelsea Deardon's fingerprints on the weapon, there isn't much that would convince me she isn't guilty. Look, let's save ourselves a lot of time. Let's be honest. There are better things we could be doing. Who thinks Chelsea Deardon's guilty?
(The jurors start raising their hands. The judge tries to interrupt Logan's speech as Logan points out his hand is also raised, the judge is in the process of calling for a new jury and have Logan arrested while a juror asks if they shouldn't at least give her a fair trial, which prompts Logan to tell the judge that he believes this jury is capable of coming to a fair verdict and conclude his speech)
Tom Logan: So we all think she's guilty. What do we do? That's a dilemma, isn't it? A problem because we've developed a legal concept in this country to protect ourselves - to protect our rights - and it's called presumption of innocence. In simpler words that means that one is presumed innocent until proven guilty. That means that whatever assumptions you've already made Chelsea Deardon must be seen in your eyes, believed in your minds, understood in your hearts, to be innocent. 
(Then the defense continues with its case.)

title: Quiet Please!
synopsis: Tom's nemesis, Spike, is trying to take a nap, but is awoken by Tom Cat chasing Jerry Mouse with a frying pan. After being hit several times, an annoyed Spike tries to go back to sleep. But he is awoken again by Tom's rather inaccurate use and tossing away of a rifle, which hits Spike on the head. The canine buries his head in his pillow, but is woken a third time by Tom trying to whack Jerry with the flat of an axe, but getting Spike instead. Fed up, Spike grabs Tom, and angrily tells him that he is becoming a nervous wreck, which he demonstrates by pulling his tongue, producing a crazed look on his face. First calmly, then viciously, he warns Tom that if there is one more sound, no matter who makes it, he will skin Tom alive. On the side, Jerry grins and nods happily.
Spike settles down to sleep, and Tom sighs with relief. Jerry then whistles at Tom, showing him a drawing of a cat labelled STINKY. Tom zooms after him, but stops abruptly when Jerry holds up a spoon and frying pan right next to Spike, ready to bang. Jerry even pokes and whacks the cat with the spoon, but when Tom turns to attack, Jerry renews the threat. Tom sneaks around the corner, and grabs the noisemakers from behind. Jerry's next trick is to set up a lamp cord to trip Tom. Tom does trip and falls toward a table full of wine glasses. From midair, he fantastically manages to push the table away and replace it with a pillow, on which he falls quietly. As Jerry gets ready to fire a large rifle, Tom races to stick his fingers in the gun barrels first, after which Jerry fires. As Tom examines his throbbing fingers, Jerry prepares to push a colossal grandfather clock to the floor. Tom can do nothing but stick his fingers in Spike's ears and hope it muffles the crash, which it amazingly does. Jerry begins to drop light bulbs off the mantelpiece, but Tom acrobatically catches them all. But Jerry plugs his tail into the light socket, lighting poor Tom like a Christmas tree, and pushes a roller skate under the cat's foot for final measure, sending him crashing into Spike!
Spike half awakens, but Tom quickly picks him up and lulls him back to sleep singing Rock-a-bye Baby and then somewhat strange version of Brahms' Lullaby while pouring an entire bottle of Knock-Out Drops into Spike's mouth, and nose. As Tom finishes the song, he lifts Spike's right eyelid to reveal: OUT COLD. Jerry comes in triumphantly and noisily banging a drum, to no effect. Tom repeatedly imitates numerous percussion instruments on the KO'ed Spike. He plops himself on top of the dog, who doesn't stir, and shows the mouse the bottle of Knock-Out Drops. This causes Jerry's mouth to drop, and then his face to fall, he is beaten. In the kitchen, the mouse writes his last will: My last will – to Tom, my favorite cat I leave my sole earthly possession – ONE CUSTARD PIE. Signed: Jerry. Tom reads it, and answers, One custard pie?! Let me have it! And Jerry does – right in the puss.
The chase resumes in full force until Tom stops in horror, as the dog is snarling. However, when the dog doesn't otherwise move, the cat pulls up Spike's chin to reveal Jerry faking it. When he sees Tom, he continues to imitate a dog by barking, then he bites Tom right on the nose. Tom takes a short break to watch Jerry attempt to wake Spike by yelling in his ear, pushing his back, and stabbing him in the rear with a pin. However, Spike's left eyelid reveals that he is STILL OUT COLD. Then Tom swings a hammer at Jerry, who takes off. He stops the cat next to a chair and graciously pulls out a larger hammer from underneath, for Tom. Also graciously, Tom hands the mouse the smaller hammer and prepares to flatten Jerry with the big one, but Jerry smashes Tom's foot first and runs as Tom yowls.
Tom is just recovering, but gasps when Jerry places a huge stick of dynamite beneath Spike, and lights the fuse. Tom attempts to pull it out from under Spike, but just then, the knock-out drops finally wear off. Spike awakens and growls at him – Tom smiles, slides the dynamite back under Spike (not known for being the brightest dog) and escapes, before it explodes. A battered Spike with some fur missing and an anchor tattoo revealed on his arm, then gives Tom a thorough beating off-screen. Finally, Spike makes Tom, now bruised, bandaged and blind, rock a cradle in which Spike is lying comfortably. Jerry takes advantage by relaxing next to him and hanging a Do Not Disturb sign!

title: A Life Less Ordinary
synopsis: In Heaven (which resembles a modern police headquarters), angels are tasked with ensuring that mortals on Earth find love. The Captain, Gabriel (Dan Hedaya), is upset at reviewing the file of angel partners O'Reilly (Hunter) and Jackson (Lindo), all of whose recent cases have ended in divorce or misery. Gabriel is being pressed for results, so he introduces a radical new incentive: if their latest case isn't cracked – meaning, if the pair in question do not fall, and stay, in love, O'Reilly and Jackson must stay on Earth forever, which does not appeal to them. They open their case file to learn their tasks.
Celine Naville (Diaz) is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman. When one of her suitors, a loathsome dentist named Elliott (Stanley Tucci), proposes marriage to her, she offers to say yes, but only if he agrees to play William Tell with an apple on his head. As she takes aim with a pistol, Elliot's nerves fail; his move results in a minor head wound.
Robert Lewis (McGregor) is a janitor employed in the basement of Celine's father's company. His dreams for writing a best-selling trash novel are shot down by his co-workers. His manager tells him he is to be replaced by a robot. As he drowns his sorrows at a local bar, his girlfriend, Lily (K.K. Dodds) tells him she is leaving him for an aerobics instructor.
O'Reilly and Jackson pose as collection agents to repossess Robert's things and evict him from his apartment. Robert storms to the high-rise office of the company boss, Mr Naville (Ian Holm), while Naville is berating his daughter Celine for the William Tell fiasco. Security guards run in and start to attack Robert but he holds them off. When Celine introduces herself, Robert decides to kidnap her.
He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods. Celine easily slips free but decides to stick around. She stays for the adventure and revenge against her father, suggesting that they extort a huge ransom.
O'Reilly and Jackson pose as bounty hunters, and contract with Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert.
Robert's first attempt to collect the ransom fails but Celine encourages him. They go out to a rustic bar, where they sing along to the karaoke machine. When Robert wakes up the next morning, he is stunned to see that he and Celine have slept together.
Robert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine's blood. Naville gives O'Reilly and Jackson the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest. To their disappointment, Robert appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O'Reilly stops his getaway. Aside, Jackson confesses his fears that the two are not in love yet. O'Reilly responds, Jeopardy, Jackson. Always works.
While O'Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the towbar and rides along. As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.
Since they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank with Jackson's pistol. The robbery goes smoothly, until a security guard shoots at Celine. Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh. Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city, to be operated on by Elliot (the closest thing she can find to a discreet medical specialist). A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sleazy sexual role-playing game with Elliott. A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliott unconscious. As they drive away, Celine explains that she only agreed to Elliott's request so that he would help Robert – and, in any case, it's none of Robert's business, since he and Celine aren't involved, whatever he might think. Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away.
To get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert's handwriting and sends it to Celine. Overcome, she runs back to the bar, where Robert has started working as a janitor, and says he has won her heart with the poem. O'Reilly and Jackson, listening, dance for joy... until Robert says that he's never written a poem in his life. Humiliated, Celine runs out again. But after she's gone, Robert's boss, Al (Tony Shalhoub), knocks some sense into him: Robert has nothing in his life except the improbable love of an intelligent, passionate, beautiful, rich woman... so why are you even thinking about it? Robert runs after Celine, but is too late: O'Reilly and Jackson, believing they have failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom.
Robert tracks Celine to their hideout. He knocks O'Reilly down and, struggling with Jackson, tells Celine he loves her. The door is kicked down by Naville's butler, Mayhew (Ian McNeice), who shoots the two angels in the head (apparently killing them). Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drive Robert and the two angels' bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a murder-suicide.
In Heaven, Gabriel's secretary begs him to intervene, but he refuses. He phones God and asks him to do so. A neighbour releases Celine from the truck. Taking his gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint. Robert has had recurring dreams of being saved by being shot through the heart by an arrow of love. Celine shoots Robert and the bullet passes through, to hit Mayhew in the shoulder. After a whispered conference in Al's bar, Robert and Celine walk outside to their wedding.
In an epilogue, Gabriel frees O'Reilly and Jackson from a pair of body bags. After Gabriel congratulates them on a successful case, the two angels embrace as they prepare to return home. In a second epilogue (filmed with claymation), Robert and Celine retrieve the suitcase full of money and settle in their new castle in Scotland.

title: The Wiz
synopsis: === Prologue ===
Dorothy Gale lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and dog, Toto, on their farm in Kansas. Though her work on the farm keeps her busy, she often gets distracted in her boredom with farm life, choosing instead to play with Toto and dream of someday seeing far off lands. Aunt Em, however, hasn't much patience for her niece's daydreaming, believing that their way of life doesn't leave room for dawdling. After an argument, Aunt Em apologizes to Dorothy for an unintentionally hurtful remark. She then explains that she only scolds because she wants Dorothy to be the best she can be, and fears that she won't be ready for the responsibilities life will soon put upon her. Underneath it all, she still loves her niece dearly, and hopes they will always be as close as when Dorothy was a child (The Feeling We Once Had).
=== Act I ===
When an approaching storm turns out to be a tornado, Dorothy takes shelter in the farmhouse as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry hide in the storm cellar. As the tornado hits the farm, the house, with Dorothy inside, is lifted right up into the air and carried for miles within the cyclone (The Tornado). It finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of an emerald green field covered with flowers. There, Dorothy is met by the Munchkins, who are all dressed in blue, and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North, who tells her that she is in the land of Oz. Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East, and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return to Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and Toto in Kansas. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides her best bet is to follow the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City in the centre of Oz, and see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, or The Wiz for short (He's the Wizard). She gives the child the Witch of the East's silver slippers, and tells her not to take them off before she reaches home, for they hold a mysterious, but very powerful charm that will keep her safe.
Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road, full of doubt and fear at what lies ahead (Soon As I Get Home). Stopping to rest by a cornfield, she is startled when a Scarecrow hanging on a pole strikes up a conversation with her (I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday). He tells her of his longing for brains so that he can be like other people, and she invites him to accompany her to see if the Wiz can help him. (Ease On Down the Road #1).
The Yellow Brick Road leads them into a great forest where they discover a man made of tin, rusted solid. They oil his joints (Slide Some Oil To Me) and he tells them how, to prevent him from marrying a servant girl, the Wicked Witch of the East put a spell on his axe so that it began to cut off parts of his body. Each time it happened, a tinsmith replaced the missing part with one made of tin until he was entirely made of it. The one thing the tinsmith forgot was a heart, and the Tin Man has longed for one ever since. Dorothy and the Scarecrow invite him on their journey to see the Wizard with the hope that he may give him one (Ease On Down the Road #2).
The three continue following the Yellow Brick Road deeper into the forest, where they are attacked by a large lion (I'm a Mean Ole Lion). However, he is quickly revealed to be a coward hiding behind bravado as Dorothy stands up for her friends. When he learns where they are going, he apologizes and asks if he may accompany them to ask the Wizard for some courage. They agree and the trio becomes a quartet (Ease On Down the Road #3), but face a new danger when they are attacked by half-tiger, half-bear creatures called Kalidahs (Kalidah Battle). After a great fight and harrowing escape, they stop by the road to rest. The Lion is embarrassed by his cowardice in the battle, but is comforted by Dorothy's kind words (Be a Lion).
Seeing a green glow in the distance, they continue their journey to the Emerald City, and wander into a field of poppies who blow opium dust on them. Not being made of flesh, the Scarecrow and Tin Man are unaffected, but Dorothy and the Lion begin to become disoriented and drowsy. Dorothy recalls that the Munchkins warned her of the dangerous poppies, and runs from the field as fast as she can with the Scarecrow and Tin Man behind her. The Lion is overcome by the dust and begins to hallucinate (Lion's Dream). He is dragged from the field and returned to his friends by the Field Mice who police the area.
Marching up to the gates of the beautiful Emerald City, they are met by the Gatekeeper who insists they must all be fitted with a pair of green tinted glasses that are locked on to prevent their eyes from being blinded by the dazzling sights. They enter the city and look about in awe at the richly dressed people that inhabit this magnificent place (Emerald City Ballet). The haughty and condescending people laugh and ridicule this odd party for wanting to see the Wiz until they see that Dorothy is wearing the Witch of the East's silver slippers. The quartet is promptly shown right into his palace.
Once in the throne room, they are assaulted by a great show of lights, smoke, and pyrotechnics as the Wiz appears in several forms before them (So You Wanted To See the Wizard). They each plead their case to him, the Tin Man doing so in song (What Would I Do If I Could Feel?). The Wiz agrees on one condition: they must kill Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West. With their goals seeming further out of reach than ever before, Dorothy and her companions sink to the floor in tears.
=== Act II ===
Evillene rules over the yellow land of the west, enslaving its people, the Winkies. She is evil, power hungry, and ruthlessly determined to get her hands on the silver slippers, so that she may increase her power and rule over all of Oz (Winkie Chant/Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News). Receiving word of Dorothy and her odd friends approaching, she sends her Winged Monkeys to kill them (Funky Monkeys). Catching up to the group in the forest surrounding the castle, the monkeys dash the Tin Man against rocks until he falls apart, and rip the straw out of the Scarecrow, leaving both of them helpless. Seeing Dorothy's silver slippers, however, they dare not harm her. Instead, they carry her to Evillene's castle along with the Lion. While searching for a way to get the slippers from Dorothy, the witch forces her and the Lion to do menial chores around the castle. She takes delight in torturing the Lion before Dorothy, threatening to have him skinned unless she hands over the silver slippers. Angered by this, Dorothy picks up a bucket of water and throws it over Evillene, who melts until only her magic golden cap remains. Her spell on the Winkies is lifted, and they show their thanks by restoring the Scarecrow and Tin Man to top condition, and reuniting the four friends (Everybody Rejoice).
Returning to the Emerald City, they see the Wiz (now a booming voice that seems to come from the very air). He reneges on his promise, and the Lion knocks over a screen in anger. Behind it stands a bewildered man who claims to be the real Wizard. He shows them the elaborate mechanical effects used to create his illusions, and tells them that he is really a balloonist from Omaha named Herman Smith who traveled to Oz by accident when his hot air balloon drifted off course. The people of Oz had never seen such a sight and proclaimed him Wizard. Not wanting to disappoint them, he assumed the role and had a great city built. He then had everyone in it wear green glasses, and in time, the people came to believe it was green.
Furious, the quartet confronts the Wizard on his deceptions (Who Do You Think You Are?), but he points out that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion already have the things they seek as shown in their behavior on the journeys they have made (Believe In Yourself). They remain unconvinced, so he creates physical symbols of their desires and they are satisfied. He proposes that Dorothy can return to Kansas the way he came, and offers to pilot her in his hot air balloon. He addresses the citizens of the Emerald City in person for the first time in many years, telling them of his imminent journey, and leaving the clever Scarecrow in charge (Y'all Got It!). Just as his speech reaches its climax, the balloon comes free from its moorings and rises quickly into the air, taking Dorothy's hopes of getting home with it.
Just as the group despairs of finding help, Addaperle reappears in a flash of light, suggesting that Dorothy ask Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, for assistance. She transports them to Glinda's palace in the red land of the south, where they are warmly welcomed and invited to rest after their many trials (A Rested Body Is a Rested Mind). Glinda is a beautiful and gracious sorceress, surrounded by a court of pretty girls. She tells Dorothy that the silver slippers have always had the power to take them home, but like her friends, she needed to believe in their magic and in herself before it was possible (If You Believe). Dorothy bids a tearful goodbye to her companions, and as their faces fade into the darkness, she thinks about what she has gained, lost, and learned throughout her journey through Oz (Home). Clicking the heels of the silver slippers together three times, she finds herself transported back to Kansas in an instant. As an overjoyed Aunt Em and Toto appear, and Dorothy runs to hug them both, she knows that she is back home at last (Finale).

title: A Star Is Bored
synopsis: The opening frame depicts the exterior of Bugs' dressing room, inside which he is talking to the journalist, Lolly (a reference to the nickname of famed Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons). Outside, we see Daffy sweeping arguing about the job he got. Fed up, Daffy decides to be a movie star.
Daffy then marches into the casting director's (possibly Jack L. Warner) office just as he is on the phone with another executive discussing the difficulty in finding anyone stupid enough to be Bugs' stunt double for his next picture. Daffy of course takes the job!
After a visit to the Make-Up Department, Daffy gets his first taste of on-the-set film action shortly thereafter (a Western co-starring Yosemite Sam). Initially, Daffy is extremely excited to be finally in any motion picture. He takes Bugs' place in a rabbit costume and holding a carrot, and stands next to Sam. Daffy gets the worst of it instead of Bugs!
Next, Bugs is in a scene where Elmer Fudd is cast in his usual role as trying to hunt Bugs. Bugs is high in a tree, and Elmer is supposed to climb it to saw the branch Bugs is sitting on, off (though not all the way through, as Bugs reminds him). However, Daffy has other ideas. He tells Elmer to come closer to him, as he has something to tell him. Lacking a clue to Daffy's actual motive, Elmer shuffles closer to Daffy, who whacks him in the head to knock him out. Daffy tries to upstage Bugs by sawing off the branch Bugs is on; unfortunately for Daffy, the branch Bug stands on is solid, while the part Daffy stands on falls to the ground!
After this sequence, Bugs is fishing off a pier, but Daffy takes no notice . He also takes Bugs' place at the end of the pier and his fishing rod. Yet he is not safe from the film script even now, as a giant bluefin tuna swallows him whole.
Another scene wherein Bugs is chased by Elmer follows this one, culminating when Bugs dives into another tree. With the scwewy wabbit cornered, Elmer aims his gun into the tree but gets poked in the rear by the gun's barrel (in reality, it's really Bugs holding another gun). When Elmer pulls his gun back, the other one makes the same movements. Wondering just how stupid Elmer is, Daffy furiously marches onto the set, snatches Elmer's gun and shoves him off. Daffy sticks the gun into the hole in the tree in which Bugs is hiding but what he believes to be another gun (in reality it's HIS gun bent around so that it points at his hindquarters) sticks up through a hole in the ground just behind him! Daffy retracts his gun; the other gun does the same. Daffy does this two or three more times before he decides to try a small experiment. He ties a red ribbon around the barrel of his gun, then sticks it into the tree, and looks behind him. The ribbon on the gun in the ground is white with red polka dots, leading Daffy to believe it to be a fake. He shoots, intending to mark Bugs, but the bent-around gun plan is revealed when the bullet hits him in the hindquarters and he pulls the gun out of the tree. The ribbon is white with red spots! Daffy didn't notice that Bugs switch the ribbon.
The next scene has Bugs piloting a plane accelerating up to 20,000 feet, then going uncontrollably in the direction of the ground. At the last second, the plane is stopped before crashing and Bugs get out and his place gets taken by Daffy who as usual gets the worst of it!
Having finally had more than enough, Daffy announces that I'm through playin' stooge to a rabbit. I need a part that fits ME! to the casting director, who promptly tells the distraught Daffy that he has just such a script: the starring role in a new movie called The Duck.
The final scene shows the filming of The Duck, with Daffy starring as a typical duck in a peaceful pond and directed by the same man who helmed the earlier movie wherein Daffy subbed for Bugs. Just as in the first scene of the earlier film, Daffy digs out his script to rehearse his line. When the director announces Rrrroll 'em, Daffy says, I wonder where all the hunters are today?, at which point ten hunters suddenly surround the pond, gun Daffy down and leave. Again infuriated, Daffy shrieks, I DEMAND TO KNOW WHO WROTE THIS SCRIPT! The cruel screenwriter turns out to be none other than... Bugs, to whom the camera is now transferred and who says, I'd love to tell him, but... hehehehe... modesty forbids.

title: Black Widow
synopsis: Catharine Petersen (Theresa Russell) carefully applies and checks her make-up, puts on a pair of dark glasses and disembarks from a private jet. She is met by her sister-in-law, Sara (Lois Smith), with a limousine. It develops that Catharine's husband (Sara's brother), Sam Petersen, died suddenly in his sleep the previous night, while Catharine was out of town. On the short trip back to Catharine's apartment, Sara tries to offer what comfort she can. She offers to go upstairs with her, but Catharine declines. She enters the apartment alone and goes to her husband's den. She sits at his desk, takes off her sunglasses, and stares sadly at the pictures there...of her, of them, of the events of their short life together. She goes to a sideboard, picks up a glass brandy decanter, and takes it into the bathroom. Looking impassively at herself in the mirror, she pours the contents of the decanter into the sink, and turns on the water to rinse away all traces. Then, strangely, she goes into their bedroom, lies down on the bed and weeps for the husband she just murdered.Alexandra Alex Barnes (Debra Winger) is a data analyst for the Justice Department. She arrives at the office in her usual dither, thrilled over the news of the sudden death (in his sleep) of a Jersey mob boss. Convinced it was a mob hit, she orders her co-worker and sidekick, Michael (D.W. Moffatt), to search for similar deaths. He finds only one: that of wealthy publisher Sam Petersen, a year earlier. Both men died of a rare congenital condition called Ondine's Curse, in which the victim simply stops breathing during sleep. But there is no other connection between the two men: Alex's boss, Bruce (Terry O'Quinn), tells her to move on to something else.Marielle Dumer strides into the office of her new husband, Dallas toy manufacturer Ben Dumer (Dennis Hopper). With curly red hair, flashy (but expensive) clothes, and an air of brassy sex appeal, she bears little resemblance to quiet, elegant Catharine Petersen...but we see she is the same woman. After visiting her husband, she goes to a bank to access a safe deposit box. Alone in a private room, she takes a bottle of brandy from her purse. From the box, she removes some jewelry, several thick bundles of money, and a small brown case. The case contains a syringe with a very long needle, and a small vial of clear liquid. She fills the syringe from the vial, and injects the liquid through the cork into the bottle of brandy. She replaces everything in the box, puts the brandy in her purse and leaves. That night, as she packs for a five-day trip out of town, Ben asks why they ran out of brandy so fast. Didn't I see a fresh bottle in the cabinet? she says. He finds it, and replies, Right again, Hon'. She smiles sweetly...and the scene cuts immediately to a funeral procession, driving slowly through a cemetery...and shortly thereafter to a lawyer's office. Ben's sister, Etta (Diane Ladd), is threatening to contest Ben's will. Marielle tells her she has no one to blame but herself for being cut from it...but she intends to leave Dallas, to go back to Charleston, and doesn't want to leave any hard feelings (or nagging questions?) behind. She offers to make a small gift to Etta from her share of the estate. How small? asks Etta. Something in the mid-six-figure range? suggests Marielle. Etta signifies her acceptance, and the matter is closed.Alex arrives at her office and the unauthorized gun in her purse sets off the metal detector in the lobby. The security guard escorts her up to her boss's office for an explanation and a reprimand. She tells Bruce that she's been practicing with it before work, trying to qualify for field duty. Bruce wryly advises her to take the gun back to Sears. Late that afternoon, Alex is working at her computer. Michael approaches, tells her he has found another death involving Ondine's Curse. Then he shyly asks her out to dinner. She puts him off, telling him she values his friendship too much to risk losing it with a failed love affair. Then she asks about the death from Ondine's Curse. He tells her it was a toy manufacturer in Dallas. Both he and the publisher were wealthy, middle-aged, and both had married younger women within a couple of months of their deaths, but there seemed to be no other connection. Alex, however, is excited by this news. She asks him to round up information and pictures of them both. Shouldn't be hard, he says, they were both wealthy, prominent men. No, replies Alex, I want pictures of the wives.Margaret Dodd (the former Marielle Dumer) is conducting an investigation of her own. Her hair is now longer, dark brown, and pulled back into a neat French braid. She is now dressing in quiet grey, brown and olive-green suits, slacks, sweaters...sensible shoes...even, occasionally, a pair of plain black-framed glasses. She looks studious and earnest, but still alluring in an unostentatious way. She visits a bookstore in Seattle, Washington and asks for books on Seattle history, Japanese cooking, rare coins and Native American Tribes of the Northwest. The bookstore clerk asks her jokingly if she's cramming for a quiz show. She gives him a long look, a faint, unamused laugh, and goes back to her notes.Michael has found remarkably few photos of the wives, and in all of them, the women seem to be deliberately turning away from the camera. He has them made into slides for Alex and she takes them home, along with a slide projector. She studies their faces and their bodies as they're projected onto her living room wall...she looks in her bathroom mirror, and experiments with her own hair and stance, noting how even small changes can make a significant difference in a woman's overall appearance.Margaret is also studying, in her suite at a Seattle hotel: photos of rare coins, an old video of a Coast Salish (Native American) ritual. Her objective soon becomes clear: these are all interests and hobbies of William McCrory (Nicol Williamsen), a noted anthropologist, chairman of the Native American Museum Board...late-middle-aged, a lifelong bachelor...and one of the five wealthiest men in Washington State.Bruce is not convinced by Alex's evidence and theory. He argues that the Dallas woman is slimmer, younger. Alex counters that it's just make-up, attitude, posture. He reminds her that her job is data analysis, and that she does the best work in the office...and she shouldn't try to get all of the excitement in her life out of her job. Alex is outraged, she feels he's overstepping his bounds. He tells her that he just wants her to be happy...she isn't happy, and she deserves to be happy. Bruce, she pleads, Make me happy. After a long silence, he finally gives her permission to go after her Black Widow.Margaret approaches Irene (Rutanya Alda), a member of the Museum Board, and offers to donate a million dollars to the museum in exchange for a seat on the board of directors. Irene primly tells her that those seats are not for sale. Fine, replies Margaret, evenly, I'm sure Mr. McCrory will appreciate my intentions, and leaves. In the next scene, a meeting of the board of directors, William McCrory tells Margaret that as their newest board member, they want to hear her views. She reluctantly suggests that they shouldn't concentrate so much on acquisition of Coast Salish artifacts (McCrory's specialty field and his passion), they should try to exhibit equally artifacts from all tribes. It's a bold and risky strategy, but it works...she states her reasoning articulately and movingly, and McCrory is immediately drawn to her.Alex visits the sisters of the first two victims. She interviews Sara first, who still believes Catharine is the genuine article, and is very put off by Alex's theories and manner. She sees Etta next, who is lying on a tanning bed in an expensive salon. Etta says she also suspected Marielle...But since Ben was dead, and nothing could bring him back, she decided to avoid the scandal and publicity of accusing her sister-in-law of murder. Alex suggests rather pointedly that she might have been influenced by the $500,000 gift as well. Etta sits up, takes off her protective glasses, gives Alex a long look...and says sweetly, You're looking a little peaked, my dear...can I buy you a tan?William and Margaret have been seeing each other...dinner, long walks, quiet discussions over afternoon tea or evening coffee. One day he takes her on a ferry ride and a long drive to his family's cabin in the woods. It is large, elegant, peaceful and inviting...he tells her he has always meant to live here someday. Why don't you? asks Margaret. He looks at her, and says, Why don't WE? During the passionate lovemaking that follows, Margaret notices a medallion that William wears on a chain around his neck. It's a Medic Alert, he tells her, I'm allergic to penicillin. She lets out a low laugh, and kisses him lustily.At the Justice Department, the guys and Alex are engrossed in a late-night poker game. In the last hand, one of the guys, Herb (David Mamet), obviously has the winning cards. The others fold, but Alex, the lone female, decides he's bluffing. She meets his bet, then raises $20, and then, recklessly, another $20, even after the other guys warn her he's clearly got the cards. When she loses, she defiantly reminds him that she'd won big from him the week before. While the rest leave, she sits down at her desk and puts her head down on her folded arms. Bruce offers to give her a neck rub, and while he does so, they chat about her Borgia lady. Bruce makes a tentative pass at her, which she rejects. He shrugs philosophically, and asks if she needs more time and resources to find her, but she tells him she's already there...they've narrowed it down to six women. She says she's going to check them out; he warns her to be careful. She laughs, and tells him he's full of shit, and she'll call him from Denver...or maybe Seattle.In Seattle, Alex quickly finds Margaret and follows her, observing her, for several days. Posing as a reporter from the Post Intelligencer, she goes to the museum and talks to Irene, trying to get whatever information they have on her. Irene admits to not knowing much, and before Alex can stop her, she calls Margaret's office to see if she can come talk to Alex herself. William responds instead, says Margaret's not in today and asks if he can help. He catches Alex in her lie about being from the Post Intelligencer, and she explains sheepishly that she is a free-lance writer, doing an article on powerful women on spec. Instead of being angry, he is sympathetic, admitting that he never had to prove himself that way. He asks where she is staying, and she replies, At the Hilton. He warns that his wife is very private, but promises to ask her to contact Alex there. Alex thanks him, and starts to leave...then pauses, undecided, still looking at him. He looks back at her, a bit surprised, and asks if there's anything else. No, I guess not, she says, and leaves him to his potsherds.Margaret has gone to the doctor for a physical. She tells him she has a case of recurring tonsillitis, and what with the Seattle weather... He grabs his prescription pad and asks what antibiotic usually works for her. Penicillin, she replies.Alex goes to the Seattle Police Department, and puts her evidence in front of Detective Ricci (Leo Rossi). He ridicules her, refuses to cooperate with her, and tells her that if this is what the Justice Department calls evidence these days, that's the scariest part of the whole story. The thing is, Alex tells him as she leaves, I know I'm right.Later, William tells Margaret of the nice young woman he met that day, and of her interest in Margaret. Margaret hides her uneasiness from him...but she hurries to the Seattle Hilton, and asks about the young woman, only to learn she has checked out and moved to the Inn at the Market. She rushes over to the Inn, storms in, and storms back out again almost immediately. Alex is in a car, parked across the street, watching. Margaret is visibly disturbed and angry...she gets back into her car and slams the door, catching part of her coat in it...she rips at it to free it, getting more furious by the moment. Her behavior, normally so measured and controlled, is so atypical as to be frightening. At last, she screams in rage and frustration, and slams her forehead against the steering wheel. Afterward, calmer, she reaches into the glove compartment and takes out several travel brochures. Leafing through them, she settles on the one for Hawaii, and drives away.Next day, at the cabin, Margaret is in the bathroom opening a new tube of toothpaste. She squeezes a dollop onto the back of a hand mirror and empties one of the penicillin capsules onto it. As she is mixing the two substances, William enters, downstairs, and calls to her...she hastily finishes, stuffs as much of the blended paste back into the tube as she can, and puts the tube back in the drawer. The mirror goes into the basin, with water running over it to wash away all traces. She starts downstairs to join him, and William tells her of an upcoming meeting with his family on their shared business concerns. She tells him she doesn't think she should go...she'd feel like an intruder. You're my wife, he says, simply, I want you with me. She smiles sweetly, and replies, I DO like the way you say that.Alex is back in Detective Ricci's office. She is angry, agitated. Where did they find him? she asks. Look, Agatha Christie, there's been no homicide, he says, He died of a heart attack--boom!--just like everybody else! But Alex guesses he isn't feeling as confident as he sounds. She's left town, hasn't she? she says, and you have no idea where she's gone. You're scared shitless, Ricci...they're going to find out about me, and they're going to wonder why you didn't check it out when you had the chance. But Ricci refuses to admit he was wrong or make any attempt to assist.Alex returns to Washington, and resigns from her job. Bruce tries to talk her out of it, telling her that she has six years on the job, which shouldn't just be thrown away. She tells him that she was in the same room with the victim...four feet away. You couldn't tell him, he says, he'd have gone straight to her, you'd be blown, and she'd disappear. But maybe he'd be alive, she counters. He didn't have a chance...I didn't give him a chance. As she's walking out of Bruce's office, Michael calls her over...he's already traced Margaret's escape route. Alex gives up her apartment, and sells her belongings. Bruce visits her the night before she leaves for Hawaii. As a parting gift he hands her an airline ticket. I've already got my ticket, she says. This is a ticket back to Washington, he tells her. She smiles and replies, I'll be back with a tan.Margaret has now transformed herself into Rennie Walker: Athletic, outdoorsy, with a superb tan and a long, thick mane of tawny, blonde hair. She favors sexy Hawaiian print sarongs and halter tops, brightly colored swimsuits and sportswear. Her target this time is Paul Nuyten (Sami Frey), owner of half a dozen luxury hotels around the world--and younger and more attractive than the other men we've seen..Alex has hired a private detective to help her find Margaret in her latest incarnation, a seedy Asian man named Shin (James Hong). She confronts him in his office in a run-down building near the docks. He claims at first not to have found the woman, and tries to shake Alex down for more money. But Alex doesn't buy it...she demands the information for which she's already paid.Rennie is attending a women's scuba diving class at her hotel. The instructor tells the women to get into the pool and pair off, and a plump girl with an obnoxious cough immediately offers to be Rennie's partner...I'm not really contagious, she assures Rennie, brightly. Another woman nearby turns around suddenly--we see it is Alex...and she says, My friend promised to be MY partner, to the coughing girl, who leaves in something of a huff. Rennie introduces herself, and tells Alex she owes her a beer. Alex introduces herself as Jessica Bates, and says she'll take her up on it. After the class, they have a drink together on the hotel lanai. Alex jokes about how much better Rennie looks than she does, and Rennie invites her up to her room for what she calls a real drink.Alex sees pictures of Paul Nuyten, on Rennie's table, and asks about him...Rennie tells her who he is and invites her to a party he's having at his home that night as her guest. She loans Alex a dress, even takes her to her hairdresser, and the two women show up together in style. Alex watches the interaction between Paul and Rennie...things don't quite seem to be going all her way, this time. Paul is quite a player in his own right. Rennie has sensed that if she has sex with him too soon, she will not be able to persuade him to marry her...she'll merely become another of his conquests. So her strategy is a waiting game for the present...putting him off, but still sending come-on signals...until she can think of another way.Alex and Rennie continue to hang out together...drives, hikes, picnics. They stop at the fish market one morning before an outing...they prowl through the aisles separately, looking for picnic fare. Mr. Shin happens to be there, and approaches Alex for another try at a shakedown. Aware that Rennie could be watching, she tells him in a low, furious voice that this a Federal DOJ operation. She tells him to offer her a cigarette. Confused, he does so, and she turns him down. Now point at the fish, she orders...he does, and she shakes her head no, while telling him to go away and stay away, or she'll have him arrested for obstruction of justice.Rennie HAS been watching, and she isn't fooled by Alex's glib explanation of the incident. That night, she calls Sara, and asks if any young women claiming to be reporters have come around asking about her. Sara tells her that there was one, but that she had identified herself as a federal agent. Rennie hastily hangs up. Frightened and angry, she screams another of her primal screams, and slams her fist into her belly.Alex and Rennie go scuba diving, from a deserted beach with black sand. At first they stay together, as they were taught in their class. But then they move apart. Rennie stops at a rock outcropping, and waits, watching Alex. Alex is inspecting the corral and the shellfish... suddenly she grabs her mouthpiece...no air is coming through! Desperate, she makes a dash for the surface. But Rennie intervenes. They struggle briefly, and Rennie rips Alex's mouthpiece out of her mouth. Then she takes the mouthpiece from her own mouth, and pushes it at Alex. Alex takes a couple of ragged breaths, and Rennie takes the regulator back...she takes two breaths herself, and pushes it again toward Alex...as they were taught in class. In this way, they are able to ascend to the surface safely. On the beach, Alex is angry, suspicious. Rennie is conciliatory...and reminds Alex of how lucky she was that she (Rennie) hadn't had her back turned. But the incident seems intentional, and apparently accomplishes the goal of frightening Alex.At a picnic the next day, they discuss Rennie's multiple husbands...and Rennie admits openly that was how she got rich. She tells Alex she used to think of it as her job, finding out everything about them, making herself desirable to them. Alex asks why one wasn't enough. Rich is hard, says Rennie, You never really think you're quite there. She glances at Alex, and sees the troubled look on her face. I loved every one of them, she tells her, Deeply. Honestly. She delivers her next comment as a throw-away: It wouldn't have worked any other way. Then she changes the subject. You like him, she says, Paul, I mean. Why don't you go for it? Alex doesn't respond, either to deny or agree. Rennie tells Alex that she WANTS her to make a play for him...that at this point in her life, she (Rennie) needs someone who can commit.They've planned an afternoon out with Paul, but at the last minute Rennie backs out, pleading a headache. She tells them to go without her. They do so, and they have a lovely time...and during the afternoon, Paul indicates that he wants to be with the woman he knows as Jessica. Alex is also attracted to Paul...but is wary of getting involved, for obvious reasons...not the least of those being that she doesn't want to be compared with Rennie. She tells him that she wants to know that whatever they have will be honest, and just between them. He tells her to look him in the face, and decide. She does, and is apparently convinced by what she sees. And so they make love.Rennie, meanwhile, has picked the lock into Alex's apartment, and is searching for clues into her identity. She also goes to see Mr. Shin, walking unannounced into his office just as he's walking out of his bathroom, rolling down his sleeve...which rattles and angers him. She shows him a picture of Alex, and says that she suspects this woman has been seeing her fiance. She wants him to get the proof. He recognizes Alex, and at first he refuses, saying he doesn't do this kind of work. Rennie says to him, Mr. Shin, I'll tell you two things about me: I'm very rich...(she takes an envelope stuffed with money out of her purse and tosses it down in front of him)...and I'm very wealthy. It's an offer he can't refuse.Later we see Mr. Shin taking photographs of Alex and Paul at her apartment. Paul spends the night, and when he leaves the next morning, Alex sees him out. She goes back inside and sits down at her vanity. She stares at herself in the mirror: she has a wistful, but vaguely happy expression on her face.Rennie is at Paul's home that night, has apparently come there to reproach him for the affair with Alex. He's sad, puzzled...he thought that's what she wanted. She asks him to make her a drink before she goes back to town...when he comes back with the drinks, he finds her in the pool, naked...Why tonight? he asks, After all this time? I think we've waited long enough, she replies. And he joins her in the pool.Paul visits Alex to break the news to her that he and Rennie are together now, and plan to marry. In spite of herself, she is hurt...her feelings for him were genuine. She attends the wedding and arranges for a few minutes alone with Rennie. Woman in love, she says, ironically. Did you really doubt it? replies Rennie, lightly. I helped you get here, didn't I? responds Alex. When you put us together, it made him want you all the more. So I guess you could say that my gift to you was the groom. Rennie hesitates, then says, I meant it as an exchange of gifts. Taking a small gift-wrapped package from her purse, Alex says, In that case, I still owe you one, and she hands it to Rennie. It's revealed to be a pin, fashioned to look like a black widow spider. Rennie is slightly annoyed, but not shaken...Such an intriguing gift, she tells Alex, Makes me wish I had more to share with you. The truth is, I'm almost sorry it's over. The truth is, it's not over, retorts Alex. Rennie smiles, and replies, Until then... Then she suddenly catches Alex, her hand on the back of her neck, draws her swiftly to her, kisses her hard on the mouth...and just as swiftly releases her and walks away.Rennie goes back to Mr. Shin's office, to get the pictures he has taken. He shows them to her, and they're as incriminating as she could have wanted. She pulls a gun on Mr. Shin, and tells him he can die...or he can die happy. He has five seconds to decide. She begins to count. Pleading for his life in Chinese, he takes a kit from his desk with a syringe, a rubber tube, and a stash of heroin. As he rolls up his sleeve, and injects himself with a fatal dose, Rennie moves closer to him, strokes his head, and continues to count. She leaves the pictures on his desk.HPD is investigating Shin's death. At first, they're convinced it's what it appears to be: an ordinary, garden-variety overdose. But Alex shows up at the scene and asks to speak to the detective in charge (Danny Kamekona).Rennie takes a trip to the mainland for a few days. Alex invites Paul over to her apartment, and tries to warn him of his danger. She tells him about Rennie's past, and even reveals her own identity and involvement. He is angry, hurt...but won't believe her. She doesn't need my money, he says, I've seen her portfolio...bank accounts... I've just told you how she got them, Alex replies. Then how do you explain our wills? he asks. They leave everything to the Cancer Foundation, and nothing to each other. It was HER idea. But Alex has no answer for this, and he leaves.The HPD detective meets Rennie at the airport when she comes back from the mainland. He breaks the news to her of her husband's death, and tells her that there is a woman claiming to be a federal agent insinuating Rennie murdered him. He asks permission to search the home, and Rennie gives her consent. Then, with just the right tone and manner of a grieving, outraged widow, she tells him that the woman--Alex, or Jessica, or whoever she claims to be--was her husband's lover before and after their marriage...so as long as they're searching her home, they'd better search Alex's place as well.A bottle of poison is found in Alex's apartment. She is arrested and taken to jail. The HPD detective thanks Rennie for her cooperation...he tells her a little of the evidence implicating Alex, mentioning the poison, and the pictures they found in Shin's office. Rennie admits she was responsible for the pictures, that she'd hired Shin, and then been too ashamed to go back for them. The HPD detective thinks this over, and tells her that they'd figured Shin's death as an overdose...but perhaps Miss Barnes has that to answer for as well.Rennie is called to a meeting with two representatives from the Cancer Foundation. It seems that since Paul's legal residence was Florida, the Florida Mortmain Statute applies to his will: Any bequest to charity executed within six months of death can be invalidated by the spouse. Of course, there's no requirement that you do so, says one of the representatives, hopefully. Rennie looks at him and replies evenly, Shortly before my husband died, he expressed reservations about your organization. Profound reservations. So much for the altruistic wills.Alex calls Rennie and asks her to come to the jail to see her. Although she's making plans to leave the island, Rennie decides to do so. They meet in the visitor's room, sitting at a counter with a chain link fence between them. Rennie smiles, pleasantly...Alex doesn't...Rennie looks away, a little embarassed, and sits down. Alex also sits. Rennie asks if Alex is ok. Alex says she can't complain...mentions that there are a lot of psychological tests, which she finds strange for a crime of passion. Rennie explains that they no longer think Alex murdered Paul out of jealousy...that they now believe her obsession was with Rennie. They think she started out as an ambitious federal agent, who thought she'd found a cunning phantom...and you chased her, and chased her, and when you thought you'd never be quite quick enough to catch her... I killed Paul, Alex finishes for her, ...to frame you. Rennie nods.The matron comes in, from the door behind Alex, and Alex goes to have a whispered conference with her. Thinking the interview is over, Rennie starts to leave. But Alex comes back. How did you manage it, she asks. Did you sneak back from the mainland? Did you use the bottle you planted in my apartment? Rennie smiles. You always did have a tendency to overthink things, she says. The most important thing about figuring anything out is...knowing when to stop. Alex is silent. Of all the relationships I'll look back on in fifty years' time, Rennie continues, I'll always remember this one.A door opens behind Rennie, she turns to see who it is, and is startled to see her sister-in-law, Sara, standing there, with the HPD detective, an expression of disbelief tinged with dawning horror on her face. Rennie realizes the situation has just become very sticky...but it still might be possible to explain her way clear. Hello, Sara, she manages to say, Good to see you. She glances resentfully at Alex.Alex nods to the detective, he motions to someone outside the door, and approaching footsteps are heard. Something in Alex's expression warns Rennie that something important is about to happen. She turns to look, and stands up, shocked. She shudders violently as she tries desperately to get herself under control. The camera cuts to Paul Nuyten standing just inside the doorway, very much alive and well.Rennie turns quickly to Alex and says, I want you to know I put the poison in his brandy...you mustn't let him... We know, interrupts Alex. We found it before he did. Rennie turns back and walks slowly toward Paul. She tries to kiss him...but although he allows her lips to touch his mouth, he doesn't respond. She walks past him toward the door, with one last lingering look over her shoulder at Alex. Sara and the detective follow her out. Paul and Alex stare at each other gravely for a moment. Then they turn away from each other and leave by separate exits.The media is in the front office of the police station. Alex and the HPD detective come down the stairs...he runs interference for her, fending off aggressive photographers and reporters. She responds to no one, ignoring questions and congratulations alike. When she leaves through the front door, the HPD detective turns to them and says, Now we'll give you a story, and leads them away. The camera stays fixed on Alex as she disappears in the distance.

title: Son of Frankenstein
synopsis: The movie opens with the Universal Pictures globe and star logo and theme song; Title and credits follow. The scene opens with a view of the small village of Frankenstein and the castle high on a hill in the background. An Eingang Verboten sign warns all to stay away from the castle, but Ygor (Bela Lugosi) stares out from a second story window. The village council meets to discuss a matter regarding the Frankenstein heir. While Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) looks on, the Burgomaster (Lawrence Grant) informs the assembled, The old Baron Frankenstein gave me this chest of papers to deliver to his son, and deliver it I shall. The other Burghers (Gustav von Seyfferitz, Lorimer Johnston, and Tom Ricketts) express their opposition to any further association with the Frankensteins who have brought death and disrepute to the village. The Burgomaster assures his colleagues he agrees with their sentiments, but he intends to meet with the Baron's son at the train station and give him his father's papers, as promised. Elsa von Frankenstein (Josephine Hutchinson) tucks her young son's blanket around him on the train. Young Peter (Donnie Dunagan) is anxious to see his nanny, Amelia, again. Elsa joins her husband, Wolf (Basil Rathbone) in the adjoining railway compartment. She notes, as she looks out the window, What a strange-looking country. Wolf replies, Not much like America, is it? It is a dark scene of dead trees. The pair are excited about their new life, joking about what the castle is like. Elsa speculates about a haunted room, and Wolf assures her, Yes, there's sure to be a haunted room. The castle itself is supposed to be haunted...because of the things my father did there. The tone turns somber as Wolf recounts the story of the creation of the creature and the death and destruction that followed, all as the result of the blunder by his assistant, Ygor.It is pouring rain when the train pulls into Frankenstein. Wolf is greeted by the Burgomeister, the members of the council, and most of the inhabitants of the village. When Wolf tries to explain that his father was a great man and that he is sorry for the tragedy that followed, the villagers wander away. A car takes the family to the castle. The servants assist the family inside. Peter runs to see his nanny, Amelia (Emma Dunn). Benson (Edgar Norton) takes the Baron's coat. Amelia takes Peter upstairs to bed. Elsa expresses her mixed emotions about the castle then walks upstairs to join Amelia in putting Peter to bed. Wolf asks about the new servants. Benson tells the Baron that the servants are Tyrolean, None of the people of the province would serve here, no matter what I offered to pay them. Wolf walks into the library with Benson. He sees a portrait of his father on the wall. The Baron opens the box of papers and reads the note his father left for him, Herein you will find my faiths, my beliefs, and my unfoldments. A complete diary of my experiments, charts and secret formulas. In short, the sum total of my knowledge, such as it is. Perhaps you will regard my work with ridicule or even with distaste. If so, destroy these records. But if you, like me, burn with the irresistible desire to penetrate the unknown, carry on, even though the path is cruel and tortuous, carry on. Like every seeker after truth, you will be hated, blasphemed and condemned. Out in the rain, Ygor stares in at the Baron in the library.Up in Peter's room, the little boy says his prayers as Amelia and his mother look on. Elsa goes to her room and prepares for bed. In the village the wagon with the Baron's crated goods is stoned by the villagers. Inspector Krogh pays a visit to the castle. He meets with the Baron. [Note: The manipulation of his wooden arm was beautifully parodied by Kenneth Mars in Young Frankenstein.] Krogh tells the Baron he will be protected while in the castle, As long as you continue to live in this place, you're in danger. The Baron demands proof of the monster's reign of destruction. He is unaware of Krogh's encounter, but is told by the Inspector himself. While cleaning his monocle, Krogh recounts his childhood encounter with the monster and the loss of his arm, One does not easily forget, Herr Baron, an arm torn out by the roots. Krogh explains that there have been six mysterious deaths in the village and all are unsolved. Despite the Baron's insistence he needs no protection, Krogh assures him he will respond to any call for assistance. Upon his exit, Krogh is introduced to Elsa who invites him to dinner. Up in his room, young Peter sleeps through the thunder and lightning. Ygor spies on the boy from a hidden room behind a wooden panel.The next morning, Peter joins his parents at breakfast. Wolf walks over to the remains of the laboratory to explore it. The lab is a shambles of broken equipment. He peers down into a bubbling lake of sulphur-laden mud. Ygor pushes a stone down towards the Baron, but it misses its mark. Wolf orders Ygor down at the point of his rifle. When Wolf threatens to turn Ygor over to Krogh, Ygor explains he is already dead. He tells the Baron he was hanged once, which left him with a broken neck and he was declared dead. Ygor opens a door of stones and takes the Baron down into the bowels of the lab into the family crypt. To his amazement, the Baron sees the monster (Boris Karloff) lying on a slab. He thinks it is just the dead body of the creature and touches its hand. When the hand moves, the Baron recoils and exclaims, He's alive! Ygor explains the creature is sick, struck earlier by lightning. Ygor explains that the creature is, in a way, the Baron's brother and he wants him cured. Wolf is intrigued by the challenge.The village council demands to know what is going on at the castle. Krogh tries to reassure the council and agrees to bring in Ygor to explain his role at the castle. The Baron has rebuilt the lab with his own and repaired equipment left by his father. He hauls the monster up to the lab and places it on the table. Later, the Baron and Benson arrive at the lab to begin work. The Baron carries his father's notes in the case, but Ygor refuses to let Benson into the lab. The Baron assures Ygor that his help is required and vouches for his servant's discretion. The Baron examines the creature while Benson records the notes. Wolf is amazed by what he discovers, especially that two bullets are lodged in the creatures heart, yet it still lives.Ygor is questioned by the village council and the Burgomaster. Ewald Neumuller (Michael Mark) asks Ygor, Has he asked you to rob and graves? To get him a body? The council threatens Ygor to cooperate or they will see a better job of executing him for his crimes. Lang (Lionel Belmore) served on the first jury and with Neumuller found Ygor guilty and sentenced him to death. Ygor is dismissed and returns to the castle. The Baron and Benson discuss the process that gave the creature life--namely cosmic rays, These rays are actually the source of life itself. Returning to the lab, the Baron is torn between his impulse to destroy the monster and his scientific quest to restore it back to conscious life. The Baron fires up the electrical equipment and restores the creature for a few seconds, but it lapses back into coma.Krogh stops by the castle and enjoys tea with the Baroness. She explains that her husband is engaged with an experiment, but she has no details. The Baron, back from a walk, joins the pair for tea. Peter joins the family and asks about Krogh's arm. He mentions being awakened from a nap by a giant. His mother and Amelia attribute it to an active imagination, but the Baron and Krogh register surprise and concern on their faces--one knows and the other suspects this is not the imagination of a child, but reality. The Baron carries his son back to his room and asks about the giant. His son's description of the giant so alarms the Baron that he bolts from the room. Krogh confronts the Baron on his way back to the lab. Wolf discovers the lab table empty, the monster gone, and searches for it calling for Ygor the whole time. Up from the sulphur pit the creature crawls and grabs the Baron. It reacts to its own reflection in a mirror. Ygor finally joins the pair and explains, You make him well with your lightning. After you go, he get up and walk. Now he's all right again. Ygor reassures the creature that the Baron is a good man, and instructs the Baron never to touch him again. Upon his return to the residence, the Baron informs Benson that the creature is alive and admits to a cold fear of it. Ygor spies on the Baron and overhears the Baron's plan to continue his experimental work and send his family away for their own safety.Ygor plans to use the monster to extract a little personal revenge. He sends the creature after Herr Neumuller. The creature follows his wagon and waylays the man. It stages a wagon accident while Ygor plays a mournful tune on his flute. The Inspector joins the Baron and Baroness for dinner. Fritz (Perry Ivins) serves dinner in Benson's absence. A caller, one of the Inspector's men, tells Fritz that there has been an accident in the village. Krogh departs and Wolf goes to find Benson. Ygor tells the Baron that Benson came to see the creature then ran away.Krogh attends a coroner's inquest. The doctor explains that Neumuller must have fallen asleep and fallen off his wagon. The wheels crushed his legs and chest. The widow, Frau Neumuller (Caroline Francis Cooke) is present and distraught. Krogh dismisses the council of Burghers and tells them he will make out the death certificate with Dr. Burgher (an uncredited Clarence Wilson). Krogh suggests the neck and heart be examined. Ygor is waiting outside the shop of Emil Lang, he is the town apothecary. Back at the castle, Wolf and his wife retire for the night. Elsa asks about Benson, and then admits to being afraid. Ygor plays his flute while the creature walks to Lang's shop. In shadow we see the creature kill Lang.The next morning the angry villagers assemble and then walk to the castle. Krogh stops at the castle to inquire on the whereabouts of Benson. Wolf explains that his wife and son will be leaving for, a slight holiday. Krogh explains that another mysterious death has occurred and that the Baron and his family should stay put at the castle. The mob arrives at the castle gate. As the crowd mills about outside, the Inspector and the Baron go inside to talk. Krogh goes up to see Peter in his room and asks about the giant. Peter shows Krogh a watch the giant gave him. It is Benson's engraved pocket watch. When Amelia returns the three walk downstairs for some hot chocolate. Elsa starts to suspect strange goings on. Krogh is called away and Wolf returns to the lab. He discovers the cave just off the sulphur pit and finds the sleeping monster. He picks up a rock and attempts to dispatch the creature but is stopped by Ygor. Ygor admits to having Neumuller and Lang disposed of by the creature. Meanwhile the ugly crowd outside the castle gate gets more unruly. Krogh returns to the castle. He finds the Baron in the Library playing darts. He explains, My business tonight is official, not social. The Baron continues to throw darts at the board while the Inspector tells of another death--this time it is Lang. Wolf sarcastically asks if it was his father's creation, or perhaps one he whipped up. Finally, Krogh admits, I promised your arrest to the villagers to keep them quiet...for the moment. He also admits searching the laboratory, but found nothing incriminating. He suspects Benson is dead and plans to hold the Baron as responsible. The Baron departs to remove Ygor from the estate and Krogh goes up to Peter's room. The Baron confronts Ygor with a gun and shoots and kills the man in self-defense. Krogh finds the switch that opens the wall. He enters the passage and finds Benson's dead body. In the lab, the creature finds Ygor's dead body and mourns. Krogh returns to the library. The Baron admits to killing Ygor, He tried to murder me with his hammer, so I shot him. What are you gonna do about it? Krogh demands to know where the monster is located. The monster carries Ygor's body to the crypt, then departs looking for revenge. He destroys the lab then seeks out the boy via the secret passage to Peter's room. The monster attacks Amelia while Krogh and the Baron play darts. It is Krogh's turn and he pokes his darts into his wooden arm, then throws the darts one at a time at the board. Elsa discovers Amelia and that her son is missing. The creature escorts Peter to the pit. He picks the child up and holds him over the pit. Peter is unafraid. For some unknown reason the creature places Peter on the ladder, and the two climb up to the lab. Krogh climbs up the ladder and confronts the creature. It pulls Krogh's wooden arm off and brandishes same. Krogh empties his service revolver into the monster, but with no effect. The monster steps on Peter while the Baron enters the lab from above. The Baron swings down on a rope and kicks the monster into the bubbling pit. The Baron picks up his son and they look down into the bubbling and flaming pit below.At the train station the next day, the Baron and his family prepare to depart. Wolf tells the crowd, Herewith I deed to you the castle and the estate of Frankenstein. Do with them what you will. And may happiness and peace of mind be restored to you all. Good bye. We close with the family on the train car as it pulls away from the station and the cast credits.

title: The Fly
synopsis: The 1958 version of The Fly, written by James Clavell, based on a short story by George Langelaan, opens with title and credits shown over a screen with a small hole. We zoom in progressively until the hole fills the screen and a fly crawls into frame.The opening scene is at night, outside the factory of Delambre Freres Electronics in Montreal. A cat, Satan, is picked up by the night watchman, Gaston (an uncredited Torben Meyer). He starts his rounds. He hears the sound of a hydraulic press starting. Gaston sees a smartly dressed woman, who he later recognizes as Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens), stare at him in surprise. She runs away. He approaches the press and notices, in horror, that it is covered in blood. A body lays crumpled on the floor next to the press. He recoils in horror and screams. A phone rings in the home office of Francois Delambre (Vincent Price). His sister-in-law, Helene, is calling. She calmly tells him, Francois, I've killed Andre. I need your help. Francois thinks it is a cruel joke but changes his mind when Helene breaks down sobbing and implores him to, Call the police and come quickly. Before he can leave his office, there is another call, this time from Gaston at the factory. Gaston reports a murder. Francois calls an acquaintance at the Anthenium Club, a fellow member, Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall). He reports the crime, then waits for Charas to collect him at his home. As Charas and the police examine the crime scene, an ambulance team collects Andre's body. Francois raises the press so what is left of the body can be removed. It is noted that the press was set to zero and single strokes. Francois positively identifies his brother based on a scar on his left leg--war wound. Francois is baffled by the crime.Francois and Charas go to see Helene at home. Emma (Kathleen Freeman), the housekeeper, meets them at the door. Dr. Ejoute (an uncredited Eugene Borden), the family doctor, reports that she is calm and admitted to the crime. They enter the living room to confront Helene Delambre. She is very calm and volunteers, I killed my husband, Andre Delambre, about half an hour ago in the hydraulic press shed. She admits to killing him, but when asked why she is adamant, I cannot answer that question. She provides specific details of the crime, then offers Charas coffee. She is polite and answers all questions except one--WHY. She hears the buzz of a fly in the room. She gets up and searches for it. She registers relief when she finds it on a lampshade and it is only an ordinary fly. She returns to the couch and more questions from Charas. Charas makes arrangements with the doctor to provide a police nurse to attend to Helene. Before he leaves, Charas asks Francois to show him the lab. Francois discovers the lab a shambles. Charas tells Francois that he is baffled and, There appears to be no motive, no reason except insanity. Charas suggests Francois take charge of his nephew for the time being.The police nurse, Andersone (Betty Lou Gerson) brings Helene her lunch, then takes her pulse. She sits and occupies her time with her reports and needlepoint. Helene makes a point to mention her son, but pretends she does not know him. The nurse registers mild surprise, then makes a note on the chart. Helen starts eating, then stops when she hears a fly buzzing in the room. The nurse bats at it, much to Helene's shock and concern. The nurse rolls up a newspaper and chases it around the room. She becomes hysterical when the nurse swats it by the window. Helene collapses and is helped back to bed sobbing. The nurse collects the dead insect and gives it to Charas. Charas asks Francois, Mr. Delambre, do you think shes mad? It's obvious, isn't it? is the reply, but Charas surprises Francois with his conclusion. In spite of what the doctors think. I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind is quite clear. Even when catching flies. Charas intends to charge Helene with murder, the warrant will be issued the next day.Francois is having dinner with his nephew, Philippe (Charles Herbert). When asked about the life expectancy of flies, Francois responds that he doesn't know. Philippe volunteers that he found the special fly his mother was looking for--one with a white head and leg. The discussion intrigues Francois, especially the mention of it being in his study. He calls Charas, but decides not to talk to him. He goes to his brother's house, and lies to the nurse to secure a visit with Helene. He convinces Helene he has the special fly and wants the whole story. He finally convinces her to come clean, but before she recounts the tale she insists Charas be present. She demands Francois promise to kill the fly he claims he has. Charas arrives and she tells her story.It started a few months earlier. She and her son are playing in the living room when her husband, Andre (David Hedison as Al Hedison) appears. While Philippe plays with the family cat, Dandelo, Andre and Helene go to the basement lab. Andre proudly shows her all the new equipment. He demands secrecy, then shows her his new line of research. He places an ugly green plate, a wedding present, in a glass and metal container. He fires up the machine. The room goes dark, and the container glows a bright blue, then a flash of light and the equipment powers down. Helene is surprised by an empty container. They walk to another room and the plate is now in an identical container. Andre explains the concept to his disbelieving wife. She chuckles, noticing that the matter transference device has one little flaw. Helene points out the Made in Japan stamp on the bottom of the plate is mirror-imaged. Andre returns to his desk and begins a review of his work. He recalculates, rechecks and retests. This time with a newspaper, the transfer is successful. Andre decides to run a test with the family cat, Dandelo. The saucer of milk transfers fine, but to his horror the cat fails to appear. He hears only the plaintive echo of the cat's cries in the room.Helene is preparing to go out for the evening. Andre appears. He has been busy in the lab for weeks and insists they go out to celebrate. They return to the lab very late and Andre shows his wife the improvements he has made to the equipment by transferring a bottle of champagne. The label is perfect and the wine is still cold. He then transfers a guinea pig, against his wife's objections. The animal appears fine after re-integration. Andre confesses that his first live animal experiment, Dandelo, was not successful. Helene expresses her concern about the technology, It's frightening. It's like playing God.It has been a month and the guinea pig is fine. Andre is relaxing out in the garden. Helene joins him. She tells Andre that Francois is coming to lunch. Andre is excited and tells his wife, Bring him down to the lab. We'll show him now. Francois and Helene go down stairs to the lab, but encounter a note on the locked door instead of a welcome inside. It says, I am working. Do not Disturb. Francois comments about the bad penmanship. Philippe enters the house. He excitedly tells his mom, I caught such a funny-looking fly. You want to see it? It has a funny white head and sort of white leg. His mother tells him to let it go at once.A report from Emma about Andre not touching his dinner does not alarm Helene. She walks down to the lab to check on her husband. She picks up a note that was slowly pushed under the locked door. She reads it aloud, Helene, I've had some trouble. I've had a serious accident. But I'm not in danger at the moment, although it's a matter of life or death. It's no good calling to me or saying anything. I can't answer. I can't speak. He asks for a bowl of milk laced with rum. She prepares the concoction and returns to the lab, knocking three times to gain entry. Andre lets her in. A note explains that he needs her to find a fly with a white head. She remembers Philippe's find from earlier that day. Andre has a black cloth covering his head and keeps his left arm hidden in his lab coat pocket. He slurps up his milk while Helene searches for a fly she knows is not there. She recounts the story her son told her. Andre gets up and his fly arm is revealed. Helene screams. Andre motions her out of the lab, then locks her out. He types the next set of instructions for his wife.The next morning Helene wakes. She thinks the whole episode was just a nightmare, but her morning meeting and typed note confirms the nightmare is real. Andre explains that his experiment by transmitting himself the first time was successful. A second try was not so. The note explains, But in the second experiment, a fly which I did not notice was in the disintegrator with me. When we integrated again, our atoms were mixed. Now my only hope is to find the fly. I've got to go through the machine once more and pray our atoms untangle. If you can't find it, I'll have to destroy myself. Helene asks to see her husband's face, but he refuses. Helene tells Emma that they must find a fly. She presses her son into service to find the special fly. Helene screeches at Emma, who misunderstood the request and killed a fly with a swatter, I said catch them! Dont kill them! After Philippe returns with no luck, he and his mother spot the fly on a lamp shade. The head and one leg are indeed white. They carefully approach it, but it flies over to the window. Helene puts out some sugar to attract their prey. Philippe catches it, but it escapes the net. It escapes outside through a broken section of the glass. It is now outside and Helene and Philippe search for it. Helene is exhausted and exasperated. She returns to the lab and tells her husband of their bad luck. While he attempts to eat, she reads his next note, If you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this. I know you will never catch it now. It's hopeless. There are things man should never experiment with. Now I must destroy everything, all evidence, even myself. No one must ever know what I discovered. It's too dangerous. I've thought of a way. It's not easy, but I need your help. She pleads with her husband not to destroy himself. She convinces him to transmit himself one more time, even without the fly. Transmission is successful, but without the fly, he is the same. She pulls the black cloth away, then shrieks with horror at the visage. Andre has the head of a fly. We see Helene as Andre now sees her through compound eyes. She backs away from Andre and faints. He picks her up and places her on the couch in the lab. He comforts her with his good arm and hand, but can't control his fly arm that means to harm his wife. He goes on a rampage and destroys the delicate electronic equipment. He burns all his notes. Helene wakes and approaches her husband. She recoils from Andre as he approaches her. He retrieves the black cloth and puts it back over his head. He erases the blackboard, then scribbles another note to Helene, No use now--help me--but don't come near me. Kill fly, please. Love you. She follows him to the factory next door. He starts the press and points to the red button. He places his head and arm under the press then motions for her to start the press. The press crushes Andres fly head, but his arm is still untouched. She resets the press, places his fly arm on the bed, then directs the press down a second time. The story is finished, and we are back in the present.Charas is told Andre destroyed his notes, but she erased his note on the blackboard. Charas thanks her for telling the story. Francois and Charas prepare to leave the house. Charas promises, I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant for her arrest on the charge of murder. Nurse Andersone is under strict instructions not to leave her for any reason. I'm satisfied now. She's quite insane. She won't hang. Charas provides a glimmer of hope to Francois, Show me the fly.The next day Francois returns to the house and asks Emma about the fly. She tells Francois it was just a fly. Francois sits on a bench in the garden, oblivious to the fly caught in a spider's web. It cries out for help, but Francois cannot hear it. It is now 10:00 a.m. and Charas has returned, as promised, with his warrant and an ambulance to transport Helene. When told of her arrest, Helene reacts by asking Francois to show the inspector the fly. Francois admits he never had the fly. Francois takes Philippe outside so he can't witness his mother's arrest. He mentions he saw the fly again, It's in a web. A spiders going to get it. By the bench in the garden. Francois retrieves Charas. They walk out into the garden. Charas and Francois see the tiny arm and head on a fly's body and the spider ready to pounce. The tiny thing screams, Help Me! As the spider covers its tiny victim, Charas picks up a rock and crushes both. Francois accuses Charas that if Helene killed a man with a fly's head, then he is as guilty for killing a fly with a man's head. They collectively concoct and agree to a scenario for suicide.Sometime later, Philippe and Helene are playing croquet in the yard. Francois arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew's query about his father's death, Francois tells Philippe, He was searching for the truth. But for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous. We close with Helene escorting her son and Francois out of the yard.

title: In Bruges
synopsis: The movie, a very dark comedy, begins in Bruges (a beautiful medieval city in Belgium) with two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are standing in a city square checking out the scenery. Instantly we see that Ken is enchanted with Bruges while Ray loathes the place. It is revealed that due to what happened in London they have no choice but to follow orders, stay in Bruges, lay low and wait for further instructions from Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ray asks Ken how long he thinks they will have to stay in Bruges; Ken responds that he doesn't know, maybe two weeks. Again, we see that Ray is not happy about spending two weeks, let alone two hours, in Bruges. To add insult to injury it is Christmas and there is only one available room in the city (although at least it has two twin beds). During one of the first scenes in the hotel room Ken alludes to the incident in London indicating that they wouldn't be in Bruges if not for what happened, driving Ray to abruptly cut Ken off and retreat to the bathroom where he cries, distressed over whatever it was that occurred.Later Ray makes comments about Harry sending them to, say...the Bahamas...instead of this bleeping city of Bruges. Ken advises Ray to make the best of it, for starters why don't they climb up the tower in the square and take a look at the view. Ray snidely says, no, he can see the 'bleeping' view just 'bleeping' fine from where he 'bleeping' is. Rays takes a seat (rather frustratedly) on a park bench and Ken goes off to climb the tower. The cost of going up the tower is 5 Euros for which Ken has change but is one coin short. Ken asks the cashier/guard to give him a break but the guy impatiently points out to Ken the sign that clearly states 5 Euros. Ken isn't pleased at having to break a large bill or the cashier's refusal to cut him some slack but he pulls out a 50 Euro note and gives it to the cashier anyway putting the 4.90 in change back in his pocket (important later). Ken walks up the very narrow, winding stairs to the top of the tower and looks out over Bruges enjoying every second. He looks down on the square and sees Ray sitting on the park bench with his arms crossed over his chest. At that point a hint to the nature of Ray and Ken's line of work is alluded to when Ken makes a gun of his fingers and shoots Ray.The scene changes to Ray down in the square who is approached by a family of three very large Americans who virtually stand on top of Ray without a clue as to who Ray is and begin to ask him if he has been to the top of tower. Again, Ray snidely responds that no he bleeping has not. The Americans are shocked and ask him why he doesn't want to go? Ray says he just doesn't want to and they shouldn't either (clearly because of their size though Ray doesn't come out and say it - yet). This back and forth exchange goes on with the Americans clearly wondering if Ray is saying what they think he's saying until Ray blurts out that they shouldn't go up because they're a bunch of bleeping elephants. The father explodes and haplessly tries to chase Ray, with Ray simply running in small circles dodging the American who can barely catch his breath after five seconds. The father gives up, the mother and daughter call Ray nasty names and they head off to go up the tower, meeting an oblivious Ken coming out the door who innocently advises the large family to watch out for the narrow stairs only to be called a bleeping a-hole by the daughter. Ray shrugs to a stunned Ken as if he has no idea why the Americans are so upset.That evening Ray and Ken happen upon a movie being filmed on the city streets. Much to Ray's utter amusement the movie includes a dwarf to which Ray exclaims Holy shit, they're filming a movie about bleeping midgets! While watching the filming of the movie, Ray catches sight of Chloe (Clemence Poesy) and is in awe of her and also mistakenly believes her to be a celebrity when in fact it turns out she is far from it. Rays stays to watch the filming and Ken goes back to the hotel room to see if Harry called. Ray sneaks on to the movie set and gets a cup of coffee from the food area behind Chloe who is helping herself as well. They have a little flirtatious exchange including discussion about midgets whom Chloe explains prefer to be called dwarves. Ray and the dwarf, Jimmy, are introduced and Ray's amazement at Jimmy is obvious and totally irreverent. Chloe and Ray continue to talk resulting in Ray asking Chloe out for dinner the next night. Chloe walks away, dropping a calling card over her head much to Ray's delight.The scene moves to Ken back at the hotel picking up a handwritten message from Harry, which the pregnant hotel proprietress has left for them. Harry is extremely ticked off that Ray and Ken were not in when he called and the f word is used liberally. The proprietress took the note verbatim and left nothing out. Ken is a bit embarrassed by the whole thing and goes to bed. Ray comes home and makes little effort to be quiet and not awaken Ken. He clearly wants to tell Ken all about his night and his planned date with Chloe the next evening and Ken clearly wants to go back to sleep. Ken tells Ray that Harry called and he will call again the next evening. Ray suggests it isn't necessary for both of them to be there and considering he already has a date would Ken wait by the phone and let Ray go out with Chloe. Ken agrees as long as in exchange they go sightseeing during the day. We see that though of different personalities Ken is fond of Ray in a de facto father-son way but won't come out and show it (and vice versa).The next day Ken and Ray are touring an old church. Ken is giving Ray the history of the church including the fact that some part of the church behind the alter is so old it may have been touched by God and touching it would be like touching God himself. Ken clearly wants Ray to appreciate the significance of this but Ray doesn't get it or doesn't want to and passes on the opportunity to (in Ken's eyes) begin to redeem himself for what happened in London and walks out of church instead leaving Ken behind. Ray walks out and sits on a bench. Across the street, he sees Jimmy walking and waves to him enthusiastically. Jimmy doesn't acknowledge him leaving Ray annoyed.The scene then flashes back to the incident in London. Ray is sitting in a confessional admitting to a priest (an uncredited Ciaran Hinds) that he is a hit man and he kills only for money. Not for revenge or out of anger, just for money. The priest who is quite dismayed by this confession asks Ray who he killed and Ray replies, You and shoots him. The priest stumbles out of the confessional and manages to make his way to the doorway into the church itself where Ray shoots several more bullets into his back. Before falling dead to the floor, the priest faintly says a little boy. Ray looks past the dead priest on the floor and to his horror sees and young boy, perhaps 4 or 5 years old still kneeling in prayer with a clean but blood-filled bullet hole through his otherwise pristine forehead. One of the bullets went through the priest and struck the child. The little boy then crumples to the floor, dead, with a note in his hand indicating he was praying to God to do better in Math and other simple, childhood concerns. Ray goes to the boy but it is too late and the scene ends with Ken rushing to Ray and dragging him out of the church. This is the incident that drove Harry to send Ken and Ray to Bruges to lay low and what is - despite all of Ray's bluster and bravado - killing him inside. Ray is tormented with grief and guilt over accidentally killing the child.The next night Ray and Chloe are sitting at a table in a restaurant where Chloe is smoking her cigarette much to the dismay of a nearby couple who don't appreciate smoke in their face. In an unexpected and oddly honest exchange Ray reveals he shoots people for a living and Chloe reveals she deals drugs to movie sets and neither seems the least bit concerned about the other's career choice. Ray also reveals his inability to be tactful by first shamelessly insulting Bruges (Chloe's hometown) and then going out of his way to think of a crass joke about Belgium and child molesters. Instead of being repulsed by Ray's sensitivity Chloe shows she can give as good she gets. Chloe goes to use the bathroom and the annoyed man at the next table mutters how un-bleeping unbelievable it (she) is. Ray hears the guy's comment and tries to ignore it but can't and asks the guy what the hell he meant to which the guy rudely tells Ray he doesn't appreciate Ray's girlfriend blowing her cigarette smoke in his and his girlfriend's faces to which Ray points out that they are sitting in the smoking section to which the guy says he doesn't bleeping care and the conversation turns into a bit of a political tit-for-tat with Ray assuming the guy is an American and therefore arrogant and imperialistic and mentions something about Vietnam which confounds the other guy and the whole thing ends up with Ray just flat-out punching the guy, then the guy's girlfriend entering into the fray and Ray punching her in the face as well. At this time Chloe comes back to the table, surveys the scene and they both promptly leave. Ray thinks Chloe hates him when in fact she seems intrigued by him and gives him a big kiss. She then goes to make a call (important later).Back at her apartment, Ray and Chloe are very close to having sex when Chloe's boyfriend/co-conspirator (Erik) appears behind Ray with a gun to his head. Ray realizes he has been scammed, Chloe admits she and Erik have a habit of robbing tourists, Ray is pissed off because it's been months since he's had sex (he doesn't seem too concerned about the gun aimed at him) meanwhile Chloe yells at Erik asking him why he came. Obviously the phone call she made was telling him not to come as she didn't want to rob Ray. In fact it seems she really does like him. Meanwhile Erik still has the gun in his hand which Ray deftly takes with a very quick maneuver involving a head butt only to find out - when a now irate Erik brandishes a very large knife - it is loaded with blanks. Ray shoots the gun at Erik's eye at very close range and whatever makes up a blank sears Erik's eye causing him terrible pain. Erik is being very un-gunman-like, holding his hand to eye and whining pathetically. Chloe takes Erik to the hospital but on her way out tells Ray to call her.In the meantime, Ken is at the hotel when Harry calls. Not wanting to tell Harry that Ray is on a date, Ken pretends Ray is on the toilet thinking this will suffice. But no, Harry wants to know if Ray is taking a poo or just a wee. Harry then asks if Ken and Ray love Bruges as much as Harry does (from a long-ago visit). Ken is befuddled but goes along with it culminating in Harry asking Ken to get rid of Ray for half an hour so they can talk in private still unaware that Ray is already out. Ken goes through a silly charade of pretending to get rid of Ray then there is much talk about how magical and fairy-tale like Bruges is. Harry asks Ken if Ray likes Bruges as much as they do and Ken begins to tell Harry that Ray isn't as charmed with the place much to Harry's disapproval. Ken recovers quickly and makes up a story about Ray walking through the city in the fog and saying something like it's like living a dream which pleases Harry very much because Harry just wants Ray to experience something beautiful because he was a good kid. The use of the past-tense alerts Ken to Harry's plan. We see Ken's concern that he just gave Harry the green-light he wanted to eliminate Ray. Harry makes it clear that Ken must kill Ray because Ray killed the boy, accidentally or not. Ken does not want to do this, knowing full well how stricken Ray is and feeling like Ray can redeem himself. Harry informs Ken that since they were sent to Bruges without weapons, arrangements have been made for a gun to be picked up at a contact's house in Bruges and the job must be completed ASAP.Ken is conflicted with his orders, leaves the apartment and goes to a bar where he drinks 4 presumably Belgian beers in 20 minutes. Ken spies Jimmy at the other end of the bar sitting with a prostitute. In talking to Jimmy Ken learns he is American. Jimmy asks that Ken not hold it against him, Ken says he won't as long as Jimmy doesn't say anything too loud or crass. Ray then enters the same bar and upon seeing Jimmy promptly confronts him asking why he didn't wave back to him earlier. Jimmy apologizes saying he was high on horse tranquilizers (given to him by Chloe) and he didn't know what he was doing or who or where he was. Jimmy, Ray, Ken and now two prostitutes end up in Jimmy's hotel room doing drugs and making use of the prostitutes when Jimmy begins a political discussion about the inevitable race war the world is heading towards between the blacks and whites. Drunk and high, Jimmy is getting belligerent and preachy claiming the Pakistanis, the Vietnamese and basically anyone who isn't white will side with the blacks. Ray seems more amused with the prospect of a midget versus midget war while Ken is seriously annoyed because he was married to a black woman whom he loved more than anything and she was killed by a white man. He asks Jimmy given that info whose side will he be on in this supposed war. Jimmy retreats and says Ken will have to make that decision on his own. Ken is revealed to be a sensitive man capable of great love while also being a hit man. The night ends with Ken and Ray leaving abruptly and returning to their hotel.The next day Ken goes to the contact's house to the gun to kill Ray. The contact is an oddball eccentric who advises Ken if he were to murder someone he would do it in one of the alcoves in the park because they are isolated this time of year. The contact seems focused on these alcoves and an irritated Ken takes the gun and leaves. He goes back to the apartment where the proprietress greets him in the lobby remarking on what an odd person Ray is. While Ken was gone Ray had given her what appeared to be his last 200 Euros and left to go to the park. Ken goes upstairs and sees a suicide note from Ray saying he went to the park so she (the proprietress) wouldn't have to clean up the mess. (Ray has Erik's gun and bullets he stole from Chloe's apartment.) Ken rushes to the park and sees Ray sitting on a bench by a playground. Ken reluctantly readies his gun and walks up behind Ray aiming to shoot him when Ray puts his own gun to his own head. Realizing Ray is about to kill himself, Ken rushes forward and stops him just in time. A surprised Ray turns around, sees Ken's gun and realizes Ken was just about to kill him. Each one wonders aloud what the other was about to do and it's obvious to both that Ken doesn't want to kill Ray or see him kill himself. Ray breaks down, Ken tells Ray to get on a train, leave Bruges and start over that Ray is no use to anybody dead. Ken explains what Harry is up to including the fact that he sent them to Bruges because he wanted Ray to have a vacation in a nice place before he died. This is quite comic considering how passionately Ray hates the place and the look on his face says it all. Ken tells Ray he can't bring back the little boy but maybe he can save another. Ray knows that Ken is risking his own life by not killing him. Ken hands Ray the 200 Euros he'd given the proprietress and puts him on a train but not before taking Erik's gun from Ray first, fearing that Ray will just try to kill himself again.The train pulls out; Ken has made his decision and goes back to the hotel to tell Harry who is not pleased. Ken tells Harry to meet him in the square when he gets to Bruges knowing that Harry will come for him. Meanwhile on the train, Ray is at least getting the hell out of Bruges when a steward approaches Ray and accuses Ray of heeting the Canadian. Ray has no idea what this guy is talking about when the anti-smoker from the restaurant appears and fingers Ray as the guy who attacked him. Apparently the anti-smoker was not an American but just a jerk Canadian. Ray is taken off the train and to jail... back in Bruges. Chloe bails Ray out and they wander over to the city center where they have a beer, Ray is unaware that Harry has now arrived from London and headed for the same square to meet Ken. First Harry goes to the gun contact's house where the guy goes on about the alcoves again to Harry and lo and behold the contact happens to be the uncle of Erik who is also there licking his wounds. We learn Erik was permanently blinded by the blank and wants Ray dead. Harry engages in an exchange where he puts the blame for the blindness squarely on Erik's own shoulders because he got shot by a blank from his own gun that he used in a half-assed robbery in which he held the gun to another man's head. To Harry, Erik got what he deserved and Erik is left speechless and red-faced. Back to Ray and Chloe who are drinking a beer at an outside cafe when Jimmy appears and invites them to watch the movie being filmed elsewhere. They decline but not before getting in one last laugh at the midget dressed in a school boy's uniform with a little cap on his head.Harry has now caught up with Ken at the square and knowing that Harry will kill him, Ken asks that they at least go to the tower to get it over with. On their way they walk right past a kissing Chloe and Ray and no one sees the other. Harry and Ken approach the guard/cashier (the same guy from the beginning) who says the tower is closed because some American had a heart attack while climbing the steps the day before. Harry asks the guy to do him this one favor and the guard pulls the same shtick and pointing his finger squarely in the middle of (and on!) Harry's forehead taps out that the tower is closed! Got it?! Ken knows this will not go over well with Harry and walks onward while in the shadows we see Harry beat the crap out of the guard. Harry and Ken then ascend the tower and upon reaching the top they each marvel at the beautiful view. To Harry's surprise, Ken gives up his gun, he says he will not fight. He says he has too much respect for Harry and owes him too much to fight anymore. He goes on about this until we think Harry is just going to shoot him when then Harry throws up his arms saying now he can't shoot Ken after the nice things he just said. Frustrated, Harry tries to explain to Ken why it is Ray has to be killed. Harry thinks Ray should have killed himself the minute he realized he'd killed the boy, that's what Harry would have done (important). Ken defends Ray saying he can be redeemed and what does it matter it's done, Ray's gone and no one knows where he's going. At this point Harry shoots Ken in the thigh (not a mortal wound) saying he couldn't just let Ken get away with letting Ray go. Everything seems to be resolved, Harry is carefully helping Ken down all of the stairs one narrow step at a time when Erik sees Chloe and Ray and they ask him to join them, but he walks away.Knowing Harry is with Ken at the tower Erik meets them on the stairs and tells them that Ray is back in Bruges and he is right outside. Everything changes, both Ken and Harry go for their guns (Ken to shoot Harry to keep him from killing Ray and Harry to shoot Ken) and in the struggle that follows Harry shoots Ken through the neck but it doesn't kill him though there is a lot (a lot!) of blood. Harry runs down the stairs which apparently there are many of because in the time it takes for Harry to get halfway down a badly wounded Ken has dragged himself back up to the top of the tower leaving globby streams of blood in his wake. Ken reaches the top of the tower to try to warn Ray but the fog has moved in and he can't see anything. Ken then reaches into his breast pocket and puts away his gun, reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out the change and begins to drop the coins one by one from the tower which draws the attention of the people in the square below, including Ray and Chloe. Everyone looks up at the tower in time to see Ken launch himself off and onto the pavement below. Ken hits the ground with a sickening crush. Having seen the whole thing Ray runs over realizing at the last moment that it is Ken on the ground and he is barely alive. Ken tells Ray that Harry is in Bruges and to take Ken's gun from his pocket. A very upset Ray doesn't know what to do but he pulls the gun from underneath Ken only to find it too is broken in pieces from the impact. Frantic, Ray tries to get Ken to tell him where Erik's gun is but Ken tells Ray he's going to die now and does. Just then Harry runs out of the tower stairs and sees a dead Ken on the ground and a distraught Ray standing over him. Rays makes a run for it back to the hotel where he thinks Ken hid the gun. Harry gives chase shooting at him despite the presence of other people.Back at the hotel Ray has just enough time to get the hotel room key from the proprietress and scream at her to get away somewhere safe for her and her unborn baby's sake. Ray runs up to the room, finds the gun then hears an altercation downstairs which is the proprietress blocking Harry's way with her pregnant belly and a stunned Harry looking at this woman in total shock. The woman says it is her hotel and she will not leave to which Harry has no response and Ray hearing all of this is furious. He calls down the steps to Harry saying they have to take their gunfight somewhere else where the proprietress will be unharmed. Not sure how to do that they clumsily devise a plan to move the fight elsewhere with their guns still trained on each other and a stupefied proprietress questioning their sanity and intelligence. The plan is since the hotel sits alongside a canal, on the count of three Ray will run back into his room, jump out the window and Harry can run outside to the bridge and try to catch him in the canal. Plan made, they both just stand there, each waiting for the other to start counting with the proprietress looking on in disbelief. Harry tells Ray to count to three. Ray counts, Harry runs out the door in time to see Ray leap from his window into the canal and onto a passing boat. Ray thinking he's far enough away from Harry not to be hit is surprised when Harry shoots him from the bridge square in the stomach.At the first dock, Ray gets off the boat and continues to try to get away albeit badly hurt and again Harry gives chase. They end up at the location where Jimmy's movie is filming which is a very surreal scene with bizarre costumes and circusque people lingering around. Jimmy sees Ray and realizing something isn't right walks over to him at the same time Harry approaches Ray from behind and shoots him several times in the back just as Ray had shot the priest. We hear Ray faintly say a little boy before he falls over and crawls agonizingly over to the dead and horrifically disfigured body of Jimmy who was hit by one of the bullets in the forehead. Still wearing the little boy costume and unrecognizable facially, Harry sees what he thinks to be a child and saying you have to stick to your principals puts the gun in his mouth and kills himself.The final scene is of Chloe screaming over Ray, as he's loaded onto a gurney and into an ambulance and his voice over talking about Heaven and Hell and Purgatory and no matter what he just doesn't want to die in Bruges.

title: The Last Seduction
synopsis: The film opens on busy traffic in New York City, quickly moving to a lead generation room where Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) oversees the callers. She clearly expects results, offering bonuses and insulting the callers reminding one of them ask for the sale four times, every time. Got it? When one of the salesmen makes a sale she offers him either $100.00 or $1000.00 worth of rare commemorative coins. When he chooses the $100.00 she says Wise man.Meanwhile, Bridget's husband, Clay Gregory (Bill Pullman), is meeting some drug dealers under a bridge with a case full of pharmaceutical cocaine. He hands them is case, and tries to take the case of money from one of the money only to have a gun pulled on him. He lets go and starts sobbing one stupid mistake. assuming he's either getting busted or robbed. It turns out it's neither, they just don't want to give up the case, and they dump the money out, leaving it on the ground for him.Bridget gets to her and Clay's apartment, finding a message from Clay that his meeting was moved back. She's excited when he comes home, asking if he got the money. Clay starts pulling the bills out of his shirt and Bridget remarks on his appearance, Do you walk the streets like that? You're an idiot! Clay responds by slapping her and then quickly apologizes, telling her he's on edge from dealing with scary people. and offering to let her hit him anywhere, hard. He remarks this is what we worked for and reminds her that she's a criminal mastermind He also mentions that he'll pay off the loan shark tomorrow, to which Bridget says maybe he'll forget. Clay goes off to the shower, yelling into the living room for Bridget's opinion on dinner plans. Whatever you want she says, as she writes a note, (backwards) takes the money and leaves. Clay realizes she's gone and finds the note which he reads in the mirror, says How are we supposed to celebrate?
He calls out to her in the street You better run!Bridget takes a cab to her own car, takes off her ring and drives out of the city, for Chicago, stopping in Beston when she gets low on gas. Before leaving she stops into a Beston bar, where Mike Swale (Peter Berg) is chatting with his friends about a recent trip he made to Buffalo, which didn't work out, landing him back in Beston. When a girl hits on Mike, he hushes his friends from ooohing about it saying These women are anchors. You get too close to one, Beston's got you for life. This is clearly a regular thing for Mike as his friends react saying Here we go again. One of Mike's friends says Tell me about the wife. pointing out Mike's wedding band. Mike complains that he can't get it off. Mike starts complaining about being stuck in Beston again, and his friend asks when he'll leave. Mike answers How long's it take to grow a new set of balls? Mike then notices Bridget enter the bar. The bartender intentionally snubs her, asking if anyone in the bar needs a drink while she's asking for one. Mike tells his friend, This might be my new set of balls. Mike orders her a drink which the bartender is happy to get now. Trying to make small talk, Mike says You're not from around here? and Bridget answers Fuck off. before grabbing a table for herself. Mike approaches her table and is told to go away.
Mike: Well, I haven't finished charming you yet.
Bridget: You haven't started.
Mike: Give me a chance.
Bridget: Go find yourself a nice little cow girl, make nice little cow babies and leave me alone.
Mike: [leaning in] I'm hung like a horse. Think about it.
Bridget: Let's see
Mike: Excuse me?
Bridget: Mr Ed. Let's see.
Mike: Look, I tried to be nice. I can see that's something you're not...
Bridget: Now I'm trying. I can be very nice when I try. Sit down. Mike is shocked when she check's out his horse claim as soon as he sits down. saying I never buy anything sight unseen She then quizzes him about his past. Mike claims he's had twelve lovers, no prostitutes, and emphasizes that he's never slept with a man. She then asks about his place. Mike says he also has a name prompting Bridget to say No names. Meet me outside.Mike wakes up looking for her, and finds Bridget talking on his phone and checking out his fridge. She calls her lawyer, Frank (J.T. Walsh) and explains her situation. Frank tells her her husband is entitled to half of anything bought with the cash, so to keep it in cash until a divorce can be finalized which he estimates could take two years. he also advises her to stay put as Clay will know to look for her in Chicago. She runs out without saying good bye to Mike, and he runs outside yelling after her. Bridget picks up a newspaper and finds a job opening in the classifieds for a Lead Generation Manager at Interstate Insurance Company. The employer is impressed with her resume, and she tells him a story about her husband beating her, which is forcing her to hide and use an assumed name. She choose the name Wendy Kroy. She runs into Mike in the hallway, who works at the same company. She tells him to act as if the sex never happened.Bridget rents a place and calls Frank again from her office. Frank tells her that Clay called talking about a loan shark and his thumb. He adds Anyone check you for a heartbeat lately? He tells her that if she won't send Clay some cash to tell him to quit calling. She says she'll call Clay and Frank tells her to be careful as he might trace it. She responds He's not that clever. She gives Clay a call and we see that Clay's thumb is bandaged. The operator asks if he'll take the call and Clay asks Is this Bridget in Chicago or Bridget in Dallas? Bridget tells the operator to disconnect. After work she goes to the bar again, where Mike immediately sees her. She takes him outside to have sex in a not very hidden spot behind the bar. Mike takes the opportunity to ask Where do I fit in? and isn't pleased when she says You're my designated fuck.They meet for sex regularly and Mike keeps pushing for information which she doesn't give. He continues to complain about being kept at arm's length. She continually makes light of his need for more than sex. Bridget calls Clay from the office again and asks him to get the number from a pay phone down the block and she'll call back. We see that Clay has a guy, Harlan (Bill Nunn) there to trace the call. Clay runs around the apartment to sound winded and when she calls back he gives her a number he already has. Clay runs in place again holding a cordless phone given to him by Harlan, while jumping rope in the apartment. When Bridget remarks it sounds quiet, he opens a window. He asks for the money back and Bridget says It's mine, you hit me. Clay tells her the $100,000.00 he borrowed from the loan shark is now $150,000.00. She offers to pay off the loan shark and his private detective and leave him ten grand. The phone rings in the apartment tipping her off and she hangs up. The trace turns up the area code, giving them the city she's in. Frank advises her to stay put since she has an alias and it's not likely they'll find her.Bridget and Mike show up to work at the same time and Bridget explains that a woman loses 50% of her authority when people find out who she's sleeping with. Mike protests, but when they get in the building she slaps Mike and acts as if he's groping her.Harlan and Clay discuss finding Bridget and Harlan explains he doesn't have enough information to do anything. Their talking is interrupted by a customer buying prescription drugs from Clay. Harlan tells Clay that she likely has an alias. Clay sees a New York poster in the mirror, and recalling Bridget's backard writing skill, tells Harlan that she's using Wendy Kroy because all she's thinking about is getting back to New York.Bridget approaches Mike at the bar five days after the office incident. Mike is still complaining about wanting more. Mike tells Bridget about his job as a claims adjuster, which she finds boring until he mentioned he talked with a woman whose husband died, and the woman remarked that she should have killed him years ago. Mike also explains that he knew the husband was cheating from his credit report, as he had credit cards for women other than his wife. Bridget convinces Mike that they should make a list of women with cheating husbands, who have big insurance policies. She then calls one of the numbers and sells the woman her husband's murder, before telling the woman it was a joke. She then tells Mike that she's using the activity to be more than sex partners when he doesn't want to play along. Mike does a call of his own and she lets him come back to her place for the first time. In bed, Bridget asks Mike to tell her about his wife. He asks How'd you know? and she says I didn't. She prompts him to talk about her wife but he isn't forthcoming saying It was a mistake. Mike implies that Bridget coming to town was significant and when pressed about it he says You've been out there. You came here, and you chose me. So I was right, I'm bigger than this town. Bridget: So what's wrong?
Mike: You can't stop reminding me that you're bigger than me.Bridget gets to work the next day and hears in a hush hush tone from the receptionist that There was a black man here to see you. She asks what he wanted and the receptionist says Wouldn't say. He was black though. Bridget can't get ahold of Frank and later that night at Mike's place, she reveals that she's on the run. She tells him she made a sale. referring to murdering cheating husbands. Mike isn't at all interested and turns her down going off to play hockey without her. She gets into her car to leave and Harlan gets into the car with her holding a gun on her. Bridget offers to share with him instead of Clay and banters with him about leaving her money. She teases him asking Is it true what they say about size? when she doesn't let up he unzips his pants. She speeds up while he does this and slams the car into a telephone pole counting on the drivers side airbag to protect her, although Harlan gets thrown through the windshield and killed. At the hospital she tells the police that Harlan had planned to rape her. Mike shows up at the hospital and asks how hockey was, playing up his guilt. She pushes him about the murder for hire again. He won't agree and she tells him she'll do it herself rather than stay there forever.Bridget calls Clay and he remarks that he heard about Clay. He tells her that he's hired a local PI to watch her, parked outside her house. He tells her that now that he knows where she is he's willing to hire a sociopath to take her out. Bridget offers to buy a week, paying the loan shark while she settles things. Clay asks What made you do this?
Bridget: I don't know. You slapped me.
Clay: That's just an excuse
Bridget: You're probably right, but I get to slap you back.
Clay agrees to her proposition as long as the local PI keeps tailing her.Back at the office, she tries to make travel arrangements without giving her name. Mike listens outside the door and seems concerned that she's going away. She tells him she's just going to New York for the weekend. At her place, Bridget bakes cookies for the PI, dropping one and putting a board with nails under his tire when she picks it up. A cab pulls up and she asks to go to Buffalo. She visits city hall and gets the name of Mike's wife, Trish Swale. She then visits Mike's wife and heads home.Back at the bar, one of Mike's friends tells him that Bridget asked what Mike's secret was, and propositioned him. Mike hits his friend who then says that he came onto her and she shot him down. Mike is distraught and drunk, calls Bridget from a payphone while drinking from a paper bag, leaving her a confessional message about loving her and having a hard time trusting himself after Buffalo. Bridget listens to the message and scribbles a note with Mike's name in a heart. Mike drives over later to erase the message and finds the scribbling while Bridget watches from under the bed. She leaves a ticket for Mike to find coming in, that makes it appear that she went to Miami. Mike assumes she killed the guy she'd talked about. Mike pulls out the note, to prove that she loves him, but Bridget kicks him out. She can't help but laugh afterwards.Mike approaches her at the office, asking for details about the guy she killed, telling her that he's trying to accept what she's done. She tells him she's leaving without him and he asks what he can do to convince her to take him. She tells him that he needs to do what she did and that would make them equals. She presents him with information on a guy named Cahill. Mike refuses again. and as he leaves Bridget smiles and writes a letter claiming to be from his wife Trish, telling him she got a job at Interstate Insurance. We see Mike opening and reading the letter.Mike shows up at Bridget's place, exclaiming that he'll do it as long as they never come back to Beston. Bridget calls the police and claims the PI watching her exposed himself to local kids. While the police hassle the PI, Bridget and Mike take off. On the ride to New York, Bridget grills him about the details of the murder, which involve restraining and gagging Cahill and acting as if he's robbing the place and stabbing him to death. He asks why he has to shut the lights off afterwards and she tells him it's psychology, to tell himself he's finished an unpleasant chore.We see Mike find Cahill on the mailbox tag. He enters the apartment and we see that he's in Clay's apartment. Clay doesn't seem intimidated, and offers some wisecracks. He critiques Mike's methods telling him if he's gagged he can't tell him where everything is. Mike can't bring himself to stab Clay and he exclaims to himself I can't do it Wendy! I just cant! This prompts an outburst from the gagged Clay, which catches his interest. He lets Clay explain. He gives Mike the details and he tells Mike to find something else in the apartment that says Cahill. Clay explains that she is planning to finger him for the murder, and figures that the cops are already on the way. assuming he's to signal her somehow, which they realize is the reason that Mike is to shut the lights off. Bridget watches the window from the street and when the lights go off she heads up. Mike kicks a wedding picture across the floor to her and confronts her about her plan. Clay is still bound as Bridget has the handcuff keys. She sprays mace down his throat, killing him and tells Mike that now they have a future. She then suggests they roleplay although Mike is stunned at what just happened. She tells him You killed my husband and raped me! Mike pushes her away and holds the gun on her, telling her she's going to jail. He picks up the phone and Bridget tells him that Trish wasn't coming to Beston. We see in flashback that Trish is actually a man. Bridget taunts him about it, and he slaps her and dares him to rape her. Mike is over the edge now and gives in, not realizing that Bridget has dialed 911 while laying over the desk. Bridget makes sure to yell, You killed my husband! while he says You want to be raped! I'll rape you! the 911 operator of course hears everything.Mike is in prison talking to his lawyer, who tells him that the man Bridget claimed to kill is still alive and that the case against him is airtight and there's nothing he can do without one piece of evidence. He mentions that he's likely facing the death penalty. He tells the lawyer, There might be one thing. We then see Bridget in a limo handling the tag that reads Cahill She burns it with her lighter as the limo drives her away.

title: Was tun, wenn's brennt?
synopsis: Text is too large - max size is 60,000 characters.




	The sound of a film reel rolling accompanies credits appearing jerkily on the screen, as if displayed by an old film projector. As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says Camera - rolling! and another follows with Group 36 Training Film. After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins.
A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector.
The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt? (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets.
The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions. A female voice adds that they are always inebriated or on drugs. More voices chime in that these people commit vandalism, resist arrest, and are misguided and sexually depraved. As this last statement is made, the cameraman sneaks up on a couple sleeping on a mattress on the floor of a cramped house. They awaken and gesture angrily at the camera, along with a third man who appears and moons it.
But these people can be helped, the narrator continues, as the camera focuses on a grinning Terror and Maik. They should do useful work, read a good book or tinker with a little bomb. Tim, Flo and Nele appear and begin to educate viewers on how to carry out an anarchist bomb attack. Tim speaks, while the others hold up placards to match his words. The anarchists take turns listing and demonstrating rules: Beginners, don't bite off more than you can chew. No handwritten tracts, throw away fonts and ribbons, and never use your own typewriter. Buy all materials at large supermarket chains, accompanied by footage of Flo burglarizing a store. Don't touch anything with bare hands, or rinse thoroughly. The anarchists then give a recipe for making homemade explosives using sugar, saltpeter, and weedkiller. One more rule follows: Occupy abandoned buildings.
The footage then shows the five anarchists (Hotte is absent) tossing a homemade bomb into an abandoned building. They gather in front of the camera. What to do in case of fire? asks Tim. Let it burn! they scream in unison as they give the camera the finger. And most important, folks, is timing, adds Tim's voice. Timing is everything. The film then freezes and the still image burns away, leaving only blackness.The jerky, amateur camerawork is now replaced by standard, professionally filmed scenes. The timer on the bomb which the group dropped into the abandoned building is about to reach the end of its countdown, and sticks. Outside the building, snatches of various conversations and news broadcasts are heard. The weather abruptly changes to indicate the passage of time, and a number on the bottom of the screen indicates years going by. It begins at 1987 and ends at 2000.
Two people are seen in the reflection on the mail slot, approaching the front door of the house. The woman, a real estate agent, explains to the man that the house used to be occupied by Americans, who didn't bomb the region of Dahlem in 1945 because they wanted it for themselves. Given all the events in Germany since then, politics in this place seems less troublesome, she says. Hear that? That's historical silence. Pulling out a ring of keys, she attempts to unlock the door, adding that the house has been unoccupied since 1988 and she doesn't know who owns it. She gets the door open, but the bomb from thirteen years ago is in the doorjamb, preventing her from opening it. The man offers to give it a try. Oh la la, she says. Welcome to the new Berlin. The man rushes the door and kicks it in, setting off the bomb and destroying the front of the house. The fate of the two people is not shown.A group of protesters yell and scream from behind a fence outside a Mercedes-Benz office building. A line of police and trucks stands stoically on the other side of the fence. Among the protesters is a much older Hotte, now missing his legs and in a wheelchair, blowing a bugle. He pulls it from his lips and begins to bang on the fence, swearing. Then he holds up a video camera and begins filming an older Tim, who has snuck behind the line of police and begins spray-painting on their cars. Hotte grins and continues to scream.
Several policemen inside a van hear a radio broadcast informing all units that a bomb has exploded in Grunewald. Their leader picks up his radio and affirms that they have received the message.
Outside the vans, Tim finishes spray-painting them and climbs back over the fence to join the other protesters. When the vans pull out, they are all marked with crude pictures and obscenities. The protesters cheer.Tim wheels Hotte down a deserted Machnow Street. Man oh man! cries Hotte. Just like the good old days! He tosses the spray can into the street and reminisces about their days as more active anarchists. Tim replies that back then, Hotte wasn't so fat. Wheeling him inside a building, Tim attaches Hotte's wheelchair to a harness that pulls him up to the top of a spiral staircase. Tim begins to ascend the stairs after him. A third man, rotund and wearing glasses, appears at the bottom of the stairs and calls for them to wait. No time, Bülent, replies Tim. We've got work to do. Bülent (Aykut Kayacik) protests that he can't demolish the building while they're still inside, and Tim shrugs him off. Still following them up the stairs, Bülent offers them a deal: A place for both of them in Wedding. Hotte laughs him off and says a place in Grunewald would be a different story. An exasperated Bülent asks him for rent, and Tim lazily replies that it's in the mail. I'll kick you out on the street! shouts Bülent. The two dismiss him and slam a door behind themselves.As they enter their dingy apartment, one of the two men puts on a record. Hotte laughs that Bülent cannot possibly kick them out, because Hotte is a handicapped citizen. Tim washes his face at a sink. Hotte pulls the tape from his camera and tosses it to him. Hotte adds that a trial involving their home could go on for four or five years, giving them even more time to live there, and that they will still be living on Machnow Street when they're fifty. As he speaks, Tim tosses empty bottles off shelves, apparently searching for something. Closing the refrigerator, he asks if Hotte can lend him a 20. Hotte, now smoking a cigarette, only laughs.Tim stands in a department store, loading chemicals into a bag. In the security room, all three of the store's video cameras are trained on him. Tim glances about suspiciously and begins to run through the store. Three security personnel, skidding awkwardly on the tiled floor, chase after him. Tim dives into a bed on display and pulls the hangings closed. The security men approach the bed and one whips the hangings off, finding no one. A PA system announces that the store will be closing in ten minutes. Mystified, the security men walk away. Underneath the bed, Tim watches them leave and breathes a sigh of relief.It is nighttime. Policemen and other authorities run to and fro outside the house where the bomb went off. It is now a total wreck. A newswoman speaks into a camera, saying that a bomb went off in Berlin and a villa in Grunewald was destroyed by unknown perpetrators. Only two people, presumably the real estate agent and her buyer, suffered minor injuries. The newswoman joins a mob of reporters jabbering at a newly arrived police commissioner (Hubert Mulzer), asking him if there are any recent developments. He answers that the bomb was the work of anarchists sabotaging building projects, and that the police will question every left-wing fanatic in town. A woman, Pritt (Barbara Philipp), asks if that is legal, and Manowsky (Klaus Löwitsch), an aging detective, hustles her away from him. Any more questions? the commissioner asks, and the newswoman asks him if they have any leads on the bombers.
As he leads her away, Manowsky tells Pritt that tonight a judge will issue search warrants, and arrest any left-wingers who object on the grounds of human rights. Pritt looks disbelieving. Manowsky stumbles over an object in the rubble of the villa, and picks it up to examine. A man with a camera appears in front of him, and Manowsky shoves the cameraman away, calling for a pair of policemen to get him out of there. Manowsky then takes a closer look at the object, which is a piece of the lid from the bomb.In the department store, now closed, Tim sneaks past the patrolling security personnel. He reaches the front door and kneels down, tinkering with a fuse box. He causes the doors to swing open and all the store's lights to turn on. Slinging his bag over his shoulder, Tim strolls casually out of the store, turning back to give it a whoop of victory before walking away.
Tim stands inside a telephone booth, banging on the glass. He emerges from it and calls to the woman whose attention he was trying to get, asking her if she has a telephone card he can borrow, as his is used up. She offers to let him use her phone, since she lives close by. Really? he replies gratefully. She leads him toward her home.
Inside her apartment, Tim whispers into a phone The Anti-Cement Brigade strikes again. We've liberated the mall to protest the capitalist pigs on Potsdam Square razing low-rent housing by multinationals. As he speaks, people in the street below steal goods from the department store, whose doors he left open wide. He falls silent as he hears the woman, now in her nightgown, enter the room behind him. She smiles at him and leaves him be. All power to the imagination! he finishes.
A dark window of an upper-story building is seen. A light illuminates the room beyond, and Tim walks into his apartment, moving as if tired.It is dawn. A long line of police vans divides itself along various roads, as a broadcast from headquarters instructs each unit as to which sector it should cover. The broadcast warns the men to be especially careful around Machnow street, where hoodlums have been known to push heavy or burning objects out of windows. The vans park and the police emerge from them.
A cluster of bottles sitting on a table begins to shake with repeated vibrations. A gourd falls off a shelf and hits a sleeping Hotte on the head, awakening him. He sits bolt upright, hears the vibrations, and swears. He wheels himself over to the window, where he sees the source of the vibrations: The police are breaking down the front door with a battering ram. Hotte swears again and wheels himself onto the indoor balcony. He hammers at a peg, releasing coils of barbed wire that fall onto the spiral staircase. The police enter and call for wire cutters. Do something, officer! shouts Bülent, and the policeman asks him to leave. Hotte knocks out another peg and a sheet of wood falls onto the lowest part of the stairway, forming a ramp. A couple of policemen, having cut through the wire, try to scramble up the ramp, but Hotte knocks out a third peg, sending barrels rolling down and knocking the police back. He then wheels himself back into the apartment, slamming and bolting the door. Man, he hoards everything! he complains, probably referring to Tim. Hotte heads for a bookshelf filled with reels of film, and pulls off a stack of them. Behind it is an old photograph of Tim and Flo, taken while they were lovers, back in the days when they all made these films and bombed buildings. Unbelievable! exclaims Hotte. He can't let go. In the stairwell, the police are now using an electric saw to cut through the wire faster, and they manage to lift the ramp out of the way. Hotte frantically piles reels of film on top of the stove, lights a match, and then discovers that the gas has been turned off. A chainsaw begins to cut through his door.
Tim sits on a bus. He sees someone sitting across from him reading an article about his old bomb, which destroyed the villa. He leaps up and snatches the paper from the man, ignoring his protests.
Inside the apartment, Hotte screams at the police to get their hands off his papers. He demands to see their badges, calling them dog leashes. One policeman, ignoring his screams, hands Hotte his receipt. Hotte mockingly sticks the paper to his forehead, still swearing at them as they confiscate all the films and papers in the apartment. Good, get it all out, says Bülent, as he watches the police carry the things downstairs. He asks them to take Hotte too, but a policeman replies that the evening news would love a story of police handcuffing an invalid.Returning home, Tim sees the police vans heading out, and a concerned expression appears on his face. He jogs toward the apartment building and picks up one of the film reels left on the ground. Hotte calls from upstairs that he tried, but the pigs had me outnumbered. Tim hops on his bicycle at once and follows the vans down the street.
Outside the police barracks, Tim watches the police vans pull into an underground garage. He surveys the building's watchtowers, high walls, and imposing security gate before turning and biking away.Inside the police barracks, Manowsky and Pritt are walking down a hallway. Pritt tells him that the task force is in the gym, to which Manowsky replies Good for us. I forgot to tell you begins the girl. She gestures to a taller man in a suit who joins the pair as they walk by. He introduces himself as Dr. Henkel (Devid Striesow), sent by security in Bonn. He volunteers to lend infrastructural support and lists his fields of experience. Manowsky stops walking and interrupts him: Ever wonder why the commissioner chose not to call in the Nation Guard, but to hire an old watchdog like me? Manowsky and the woman dismissively walk on without Henkel. I have, actually, Henkel answers and follows.In their apartment, Hotte explains to Tim that the police searched the entire neighborhood, but here is where they found the evidence. They still haven't screened the films yet. Once they do, we're screwed, replies Tim. Tossing a tangled reel to the floor, he suggest they go to Poland. Hotte asks what will happen to the others in the films, and Tim shrugs it off as not being his problem. I thought we didn't betray our friends, says Hotte. Tim points out that they don't even know where their old friends live now. Hotte grins and pulls out an address book, holding it open. Tim reads the page and says he won't set foot in that rich ghetto.Three people sit at a table in a spacious office with pictures on the walls and a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking a fountain. A fourth man paces back and forth, and angrily punches a small punching bag sticking up from the floor on a spring. A closer shot reveals him to be Maik, now older and wearing a purple suit, with a pink ribbon fastened to one lapel. He silently turns to face the three people at the table, pulls out a marker, and draws a cake with a candle on a sheet of paper. He tosses the paper derisively at the three people. You want a piece of the pie? he says. With us you take the cake. I want that slogan in Helvetica and add a line. He sits at the table. The man across from him says that Maik's problem is he keeps changing the campaign around. I have no problem. I'm the boss, I'm looking out for our shareholders, replies Maik. We're thirty-two times oversubscribed. I'm ingenious, I'm a genius. And this stuff-- he throws a pile of potential ads into the air --is bullshit! Or do you disagree?
Tim ambles down a hallway, passing a receptionist's desk. The receptionist follows him and tells him he can't just walk in. Just then Maik's voice gets Tim's attention. Maik is still yelling at his subordinates about advertisements. Forget it, says Tim, and turns to leave. Just then, Hotte rolls in, screaming triumphantly. Maik looks up. Oh, shit, he says. He walks across the conference table and approaches his old friend in disbelief. He and Hotte greet each other enthusiastically, and Maik gives Tim a hug. Tim appears less than pleased to see Maik, who realizes this and looks uncomfortable. What do you want? he asks.A woman wrapped mummy-like in gauze bandages playfully chases a group of children around an apartment. There are balloons and streamers lying around, as if for a birthday party. The woman kneels to talk to a girl. Mama, can Sasha and Holger come up too? the girl asks. The woman replies that the deal was six kids for six years. Her daughter says that when she's as old as her mother, she'll have thirty-three friends over. The woman jokingly wonders if she'll have that many, and she and her daughter hug. The women removes the bandage on her face, revealing herself to be an older Nele. She then looks up to see Hotte and Tim in the doorway.
Tim explains to Nele that the whole operation is filmed on those tapes, in close-up. Nele ignores them and tells her daughter, Melli, to stop fiddling with her shoes, and that they are going for a walk. Did you hear me? asks Tim. Nele ignores him and fiddles with her daughter's shoe. Tim strides over, pulls out a knife, and cuts the shoelace tying Melli's shoes together. Are you nuts? cries Melli. Nele protests that she put all her anarchist activities behind her.On an upper floor of a tall building, Tim and Hotte stand before a third man, who paces. I don't understand, he says. That stuff never blew up. It was a great job, replies Tim. You really knew your stuff, Terror. Hotte reminds him of something he used to say: Stay high, be free, it's Terror A to Z. The third man finally turns to face the camera -- it is indeed an older Terror, missing his mohawk and wearing a judge's robes. He asks desperately if they can even see him in the film. Smoke from Hotte's cigarette wafts into Terror's face, and Terror seems to accept that he is in trouble.That wasn't even a real bomb, protests Nele in her apartment. We weren't the RAF! Tim says that she was, and Nele becomes angry at him for saying that. Tim reminds her that they made the films to show their children that they stood up to the pigs.
It's just that nobody cares anymore, says Tim, now speaking to Maik. Except the police, says Maik, shaking a bottle of pills.
That's the problem, says Terror in the law office. He cites the section of the penal code covering bombs. His mouthful of legal jargon concludes that the punishment for the friends would be a sentence of at least eight years.
Eight years? But I'm a celebrity! protests Maik. (It is unclear whether he and the other characters are actually speaking to each other, or they are in different places and the scene is edited to make it appear that way.) Maybe seven years, with a good lawyer, says Terror. Nele mutters that Melli will be thirteen in seven years. Maik asks if there is a statute of limitations. Terror slams his law book decisively. Not for attempted murder, he states.
Tim, Hotte, and Nele now appear in the room in Terror's building. A memorial service for the victims? asks Tim. He says they got the right guys: A real estate broad and an asshole from Bonn. Terror puts his hand over Tim's mouth and drags him to a corner, looking about nervously.
Outside Nele's apartment, she tells Tim and Hotte that they almost killed two people. Don't you have any feelings? she says, and slams the door in their faces. Inside her apartment, she tells herself that they won't be suspected, because they have changed so much.
In his law offices, Terror suggests they turn themselves in to set a good example, but Tim is skeptical.
In Maik's office, Maik's associates call to him that the board is waiting. Maik asks Tim if there is anything else. Tim grabs a candy from Maik's desk and turns to leave. Hotte snatches a handful of candies and throws them in Maik's face.In a dimly lit gymnasium, Henkel addresses a group of men about the findings from analyzing the bomb. Manowsky stands and interrupts him, already familiar with the old anarchist recipe for bombs. Striding up and down the room, he tells the group that the ingredients used to make the bomb are at least twelve years old, and that the pressure cooker that housed the bomb came out in 1984. So, he says, the time frame for the bomb is between 1984 and 1988. Though politics have changed, he says, this bomb is from a time when West Berlin was still an island. Manowsky stops moving and faces the group. He tells them to find him every activist splinter group active during that time.Tim and Hotte pull up in front of their apartment in a beat-up van. Tim gets out of the van and takes several suitcases from the curb, loading them into the back. Hotte says that it doesn't matter that all their old friends are assholes now, and Tim has much more going for him than some stupid ad man. And they really brainwashed Terror, he adds. Tim tells him to shut up, and Hotte reminds him that he's the only friend Tim has left. As Tim heads into the apartment building, Hotte calls to him not to forget Hotte's parka.
Tim enters the apartment and gathers up a few odds and ends. He discovers an older Flo in his bedroom, wearing a white coat. Tim stonily says hello. She tells him she couldn't even find this place anymore, because the street is full of new buildings. And they renamed the Dimitroff! she adds. There is an awkward silence. I have long hair now, Flo states unnecessarily. Flattering, isn't it? Tim gives a small nod. Flo walks over to catch the water dripping from the ceiling, noting that the roof still leaks. Tim says he's had a lot on his mind and hasn't fixed it yet. Eleven years, murmurs Flo. She then tells him that Old Bruiser Manowsky got the bomb case. He knows the scene and exactly who they are, she reminds him. She says that the others agree they're in this together. So that means someone sent you, says Tim. Flo says she thought he could go in and get the reels of film, since he saved them and none of the others would recognize them. Tim walks away and Flo follows him outside, calling to him. She reminds him that only he knows which one shows the bomb scheme. Hotte sees her and happily greets her from inside the van. Tim slams the van's door shut and heads for the driver's side. That's how it is, says Flo. I can't change it. What about Poland? asks Hotte. Tim climbs into the van and drives off without a word, leaving Flo alone in the street.
Tim and Hotte drive in silence. Shut up, says Tim. Hotte replies that he didn't say a word. More silence follows. Hotte breaks it by saying No pot in Poland, anyway, and grins. Tim looks pensive.
The van pulls back up in front of the apartment building it just left. Flo is still standing out front. Tim gets out and quietly tells her he'll do it. She smiles and says Good. What about the others? asks Tim.Flo, Nele, Maik, and Terror enter the apartment building, followed by Tim. They look unsettled at being back in their old home. Hotte happily calls down to them from above. Terror carries a small black dog in his arms. As they ascend the stairs, Nele asks what the smell is. They glance at the ancient graffiti coating the walls. Terror jumps as Maik turns on a loud handheld air horn. He turns it off after a second.
Inside the apartment, Maik tells Tim it's good to see him again. Tim doesn't believe him, but Maik insists he means it. Hotte tries to energize the group by pretending things are just as they used to be, but the others only look around uncomfortably. I won't use violence, says Nele. I've only got until Friday, says Flo. I won't break any laws, says Terror. Hotte pulls on a mask, shouting But I can! Terror asks exactly what they're doing, and Tim tells him they're breaking into police barracks.The next scene is a montage of the group's planning. Maps of the barracks are unrolled and wooden blocks are moved about upon them. Hotte watches the place from the van through binoculars. Sitting in the apartment, the former anarchists discuss the plan. Nele tells them the barracks used to station 8,000 troops during the Nazi regime, and that one day only seventeen men returned from battle. Tim and Flo briefly make eye contact and then turn away. The group identifies weak points in the barracks and uncovers the schedule for its security. Nele uses a device disguised as a stroller to measure the length of the building's perimeter. Tim sits outside the barracks on a bench and snaps photos while Flo distracts the guards. Sitting down beside him, Nele remarks that men are stupid and easily distracted by women. Tim gives her a look. Okay, women are no better, she admits.
Tim says that they'll never get past the ID check at the gate. Terror, holding a dog leash, runs along outside the fence, calling for Hotte to stop. Hotte laughs and tosses Terror's dog over the fence. Terror uses his dog as an excuse to get inside the perimeter and covertly snap pictures. There are armored doors, tanks, water cannons, and attack dogs.Tim pulls a developing photo from a tub of water. He glances at it; it's one he snapped of Flo while he was photographing the outside of the barracks. Changing her baby, Nele remarks to Tim that it's nice to spend time with people who aren't toddlers. Tim asks how she changed so much from the anarchist she used to be. You were the best, he says, picking up the baby and bouncing it. Nele tells him that it was hormones and nesting instinct. She grew up, left home, and got a job. Tim asks where her children's father is, and Nele gives him a defensive look. Just then the washing machine jams. Nele angrily kicks it, exclaiming that she only bought it four years ago. After four years, she says, everything falls apart.An anchorwoman on TV announces that one of the victims of the bomb was a government employee. The six former anarchists sit around a small table, ignoring the TV. Terror tells Hotte that he can go to night school online now, and offers to lend Hotte his old notes. Hotte asks Terror to lend him the rum instead, and Terror passes him a bottle. Nele gives up trying to offer them tea, and asks who's taking the early shift tomorrow. Terror says he's busy with work and has a cold. Maik says he has to butter up his board of directors. Flo says she's busy, and refuses to say why. She suggests Nele do it. Nele says she did it today, and besides, she has kids. Flo tells her to get a babysitter, and then offers to pay for it. Nele becomes angry and accuses Flo of trying to buy her. Quiet, the kids, says Hotte. Terror asks how they will get into the fortress, and Maik says they will let experts handle it. He suggests hiring Romanians to go in and get the film. Nele points out that they will just blackmail the group. Maik says they'll just write a check, and he and Terror begin to argue about the best course of action. Terror wants to turn himself in, but Nele says that won't happen. Flo suggests entering the barracks via hot-air balloon. Nele and Maik dismiss the idea, but Tim defends it. Maik tells him to be realistic. Then Maik has another idea: Take the film from inside. This time, he says, we use the system.Manowsky sits in a press conference, speaking about a typewritten letter made untraceable by the usual anarchist techniques. The letter is signed Group 36, with whom the police are unfamiliar. Maik sits among the press. A reporter begins to ask questions, and Manowsky answers that the police received the note in 1987, that notes like these were very common at that time, and that the police did nothing because the homemade bombs didn't usually go off. Why did this one? asks the reporter. Shit happens, says Maik in English, earning laughs. Manowsky answers one last question, that this is all the police have for now, and then ends the press conference. But as Manowsky turns to leave, Henkel motions the reporters back into their seats. He informs them that the letter has been linguistically analyzed, and that they're dealing with determined and clever terrorists, judging by their use of technical jargon. (I bet something got stuck in the sucking thingy, Nele says to Tim as he tries to repair her washing machine.) Henkel adds that there are also marked fecal references. (Hotte, holding Nele's baby, sniffs his hand and looks disgusted.) The letter's syntax and prose indicate substance abuse, says Henkel. (Terror, breathing heavily, looks up from a mug containing some kind of inhalant.) Henkel finishes by saying these people are unpredictable because they believe in a cause. Looking satisfied, he ends the press conference. As everyone leaves, Maik approaches Henkel and compliments him on his speech. He asks him to repeat it for ATV Berlin in an exclusive interview tomorrow, and hands Henkel a business card. Henkel says it might be possible, and leaves. Maik stands still, apparently amazed at how gullible Henkel is.
You can't snub the press, says Henkel to Manowsky as they walk down a hallway inside the barracks. It's important for making citizens feel secure, and it helps to work with the press, says Henkel, handing Manowsky Maik's card. Manowsky disagrees and tears the card in two, dropping it. No press, he tells Henkel, and stalks off. Henkel looks after him, then bends to pick up the pieces of the card.Nele, Terror, Hotte, and Maik sit in Maik's office, about to eat. Maik overpays the man who delivered their food, remarking that these days he screws the state through tax evasion. Nele calls him an asshole, and Maik sarcastically says she has a way with words. Nele asks him if he can take anything seriously, and Maik replies No, can you? Nele answers that she takes her family seriously and tries to teach her kids not to grow up like Maik. She calls it a small daily battle not to forsake our old beliefs. She can still look in the mirror, she says. Maik asks her what she sees there. Terror tells him to cut it out, and Maik exclaims loudly Why team up against me? He says he isn't all that uptight, and at least he's entertaining. He loves his company, his penthouse, his maid -- his phone rings -- and I love my cell phone. He answers, speaks briefly into the phone, thanks the person on the other end, and hangs up. As he turns around, it can be seen that his shirt reads I [heart] Bill Gates. Tim enters the room and looks at Maik. Maik quietly tells the group that a TV crew will be covering the police task force tomorrow. Hotte excitedly says they could join the crew, and Terror informs him they are the crew.
Maik stands behind a camera, snapping photos of the other former anarchists. Nele irritably asks if he's still calling the shots. Maik says that's how he got ahead: Endless philosophizing while living on Machnow Street. He then uses his computer to modify the photos. Now I manipulate speech for my own reasons, he continues, passing out false press passes to the others. And the other guy thinks it was his idea all along. Tim gives Maik a stony look and rudely knocks into him on his way out.As Flo and Tim walk down a street at night, Flo tells Tim about a guy who worked for an airline, presumably someone she dated. He got her cheap flights all over the world. Africa was her favorite place. She tells Tim he'd like the desert; that it's endless, with no fences in the way, and at night it's freezing. She says you could lie on a rock looking up at the sky and think that the stars belong to you. Tim breaks a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament off a car as he passes it. He says they could go there together when this is all over. He just has to take care of Hotte. Flo says it's strange that guys always want to go away with her, and Tim asks what's strange about that. Ignoring his question, Flo says she should stay put for a while. Grinning, Tim says he's good at that too. He heads over to another car with a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament. Flo tells him not to break it off. Tim brushes her hair back from her cheeks and says he wasn't even thinking about it. Flo says it took a long time to forget him. As he stares into her eyes, Tim breaks off the hood ornament and offers it to her. Break what breaks you, she says. Isn't that how it went? She climbs up on the car's hood and jumps up and down, shouting the slogan. Tim joins her, and the two of them laugh joyfully. Flo hops down and surprises Tim by taking out her keys and remotely unlocking that very car. Tim realizes the car is hers and stops jumping. Flo tells him he is always against things and never for anything. She says she's tired of living with no tomorrow, and she doesn't want to travel with him or sleep with him on dirty mattresses. So we stay in a hotel, says Tim, no longer smiling. Flo sighs exasperatedly and says he knows nothing about her. She gets in her car and drives away. Tim hurls the hood ornament after her car, and begins to walk in the opposite direction.
Flo sits in her car by the side of the road, crying. Her cell phone rings, and she answers and says she'll be home soon.
Nele cleans toys off the floor of her apartment. Kneeling, she catches sight of her reflection in the stove. She looks at it for a moment and then and turns away.
Maik lies on the table in his office at night, playing with a toy robotic dog. He talks to it and laughs.Tim takes a hot shower. Someone walks into his room, sits down, and turns on a film projector. The light from the projector causes Tim to turn around. He shuts off the water and pulls back the shower curtain to see Maik, sitting comfortably in Tim's chair and grinning. What? asks Tim. The films were our best work, Maik tells him. All Maik's advertisements were ideas recycled from those films. Toweling himself off, Tim asks what Maik wants. Maik stands and hands Tim a suit jacket that Maik bought for him. Tim says Maik can keep it, and Maik drops it onto a chair. He asks if Tim has been here all along, and Tim replies that Maik knew where he was and could have come by anytime. Maik says it [the anarchist activities] was over before the evictions. Tim disagrees, saying the two of them could have made a difference. Maik says this is pathetic, and Tim asks him why. This used to be our city, says Tim, the city of our dreams! Maik laughs that that was eleven years ago, and asks Tim how long he wants to keep this up. Tim angrily whacks a lampshade and turns away. You're wasting your life, Maik tells him. Tim says that's capitalist bullshit, and that he doesn't want to be like Maik. Maik replies Don't want to, or can't?Manowsky sits before a microfiche machine in a dimly lit room. He finds a picture of Group 36 in an old newspaper, with the slogan Films for Free and Freedom.Outside the barracks, Terror sits inside a news van, while Maik paces anxiously. Hotte and Nele come hurrying up, along with Nele's daughter and baby. Maik asked what happened, and Nele explains she couldn't find a babysitter. She doesn't know where Tim or Flo is. Maik says he'll go in alone. Hotte says he'll come along, but Maik says he can't because he's missing his legs. Nele asks Hotte to watch her children, and he nods reluctantly. She gives Hotte a kiss on the cheek and runs after Maik.
Tim comes running up to find Maik and Nele already inside the gate. He shows his fake press ID and the guard opens the gate for him. Maik sees he is wearing the jacket Maik bought him and remarks that Tim looks good. Tim smiles, and the three of them turn to greet Henkel, who emerges from inside the barracks. Maik tells Henkel that Tim is their cameraman, and hands Tim a camera. Tim confidently hefts it onto his shoulder, and they all walk into the barracks. A taxi pulls up and Flo gets out, but Hotte tells her she is too late to join the fake film crew.Pritt brings a mug to Manowsky at his desk. While shaving, he tells her that Group 36 was a political film club in Kreuzberg. He explains that the anarchists mixed stolen footage with their own propaganda to make films. He lists information the police will have to gather, and remarks that the federal jerk [Henkel] will come in handy. He asks where Henkel is.
Meanwhile, Henkel shows Tim, Maik, and Nele around the barracks, describing their protocol and capabilities.Outside the barracks, Hotte plays catch with Nele's daughter, Melli. Uncle Hotte, where are your legs? she asks. Hotte looks uncomfortable. He sighs and tells her the police stole them. Melli says that's mean. She goes over to hug Hotte and tells him she knows what Nele is doing in the barracks. She says Nele is finding Hotte's legs. Hotte and Flo exchange a look of regret, and Hotte tosses the ball back to Melli.
Inside the barracks, Manowsky walks purposefully down a hallway.
In a courtyard, Maik asks Henkel where the seized evidence is kept. He tells them it's in the basement, and asks if it interests them. Nele answers that everything interests them.
Manowsky pokes his head into an office and asks where Henkel is. Hearing that Henkel is showing journalists around, Manowsky mutters grumpily and dials a phone hanging on the wall.
In the basement, Henkel unlocks a cage and leads the fake film crew into the evidence locker. He tells them that the evidence is stored alphabetically by street name. Hearing a ringing phone, Henkel excuses himself and rushes off. Tim, Maik, and Nele look inside another cage and see their films in bins labelled Machnow Street. Henkel picks up the phone, snaps Not now, and hangs up, surprising Manowsky on the other end. Returning to the fake film crew, Henkel tells them his men work around the clock to clean up Berlin. What about the anarchists? asks Tim. Where to they go once the city's cleaned up? Into work camps! The bombings weren't that bad, and the victims of the latest one deserved it, Tim continues loudly. Nele and Maik try to pass it off as a joke, but Henkel grows suspicious and asks the name of their station. Just then, Manowsky enters the basement and calls to Henkel. Nele hurriedly thanks Henkel and the fake news crew turns to leave. Tim hides his face with the camera and bumps into Manowsky on his way out, causing Manowsky to drop the picture of Group 36. Tim bends and picks it up for him. Manowsky stares suspiciously after Tim, then runs after him, ignoring the confused Henkel.
Outside, the anarchists pile into their news van and drive away. Manowsky runs out of the barracks, shouting at the guards not to close the gate, but he sees only the retreating van.Inside the van, Nele and Maik berate Tim for his outburst. Hotte exclaims that he recognized that old bastard Manowsky. Flo tells Terror to drive faster, and tells Nele and Maik to leave Tim alone. Nele gets angry at Flo for not being there on time, and Flo says Nele is just jealous. Jealous of what? shouts back Nele. That you get everything on a silver platter? Terror stops the van for a red light. Maik tells Nele to keep her kids quiet, then sees that a police van is right behind them. He yells at Terror to drive, but Terror refuses to run the red light. Maik hisses at Terror Your kind is to blame for the Third Reich! As they argue, Hotte answers a ringing cell phone. Not a good time, he tells the caller. Terror panics and begins to scream that every one of them is guilty. Nele hits him with one of her children's toys and tells him to get back to driving the van. The police van pulls up to the light next to the news van, and the driver sees Nele hitting Terror. Just like our marriage, remarks the driver. First the fights, then the silence. He and his companion amusedly watch the hysterical Terror leave the van in the middle of the street, as Nele calls for him to come back.
Nele chases Terror into the subway and catches up with him. She calls him Robert and tells him it doesn't matter. Terror, panting and ashamed, says he knows he was always weird, but nobody cared on Machnow Street. I was just crazy Terror, the wimp - and he belonged too. He sits morosely on the subway steps. Nele kneels next to him and gives him a hug, but Terror tells her to leave him alone and walks away.Hotte, Nele, and Maik, and Melli lie on a blanket of dead leaves as more fall around them. Nele says she saw the films in a crate, and Maik says they probably have a day or two. Maik dials his phone and asks for Schmitz. He tells Schmitz to sell when the stock hits ninety. Nearby, Flo climbs up to join Tim, sitting on the news van. I thought if anyone could get us out, it would be you, she says. Melli asks if they are all going to jail. Tim stands and announces We'll build another one! He proposes they build another bomb and blow up the evidence. Hotte laughs gleefully and flings a handful of leaves in the air. Nele objects that they can't endanger anyone, and Tim reminds her that no one's around the barracks on Friday night. Nele asks for a 20 for a taxi. As Maik reaches into his pocket, she tells him this isn't funny, and she'll pay him back. Maik hands her the 20. He then walks over to Tim and calls him insane. He seems to be against Tim's idea, but then decides it is a challenge and will work. Flo asks if they are crazy. Nele says they will never do it and storms off with her children.Manowsky walks down a hallway in the barracks. As he approaches the commissioner, Manowsky says he needs search warrants for 350 people -- everyone who lived on Machnow Street. The commissioner refuses because if things go wrong, the press will attack him. Manowsky tells the commissioner that six people tricked Henkel into spying on Manowsky. The commissioner asks for evidence, and Manowsky says that the crime happened twelve years ago, and there is no more evidence. Manowsky grows impatient and storms off.Tim, Nele, Flo, and Maik carry bundles of materials up the stairs to Tim's apartment. Nele asks Maik how he plans to get the bomb in. Maik answers it will go in the same way the film got in, and likens this ploy to the Trojan horse. Nele asks how he will make certain the films are destroyed in the blast. Maik has no answer, and jokes that they will send someone in.
In the apartment, Hotte hammers nails into wood slats to make a crate. Nele asks who will fit in the crate, and Maik jokes that a kid might. Nele is not amused. Tim explains that they won't need a person in the crate. Because the evidence is sorted alphabetically, it will be placed next to the letter M, near the film. Melli appears and tells Nele she can't sleep. Nele speaks impatiently to Melli and tells her to shut up, and Melli runs away. The others give Nele admiring looks. Nele sits at the table and reads from the anarchists' manual the instructions for building a bomb.All six of the friends sit around a table, constructing the bomb. A song is playing, the same one that played as all the characters were first introduced. Flo tries in vain to open a fire extinguisher, and Hotte hands her some pliers. Hotte lights up a joint and passes it around. Maik takes a puff and says it is beneath him, but good. Flo still cannot open the extinguisher, so Tim takes a hammer and knocks off the seal. The film plays in slow motion as flame-retardant sprays out and rains down on all the friends. As they dance around reveling in the mess they're making, scenes from the film's introduction appear faded in the background, showing each younger anarchist fighting the police and causing mayhem. At the end of the scene, present-day Tim and Flo kiss.
Tim flicks a switch, arming the bomb. He carefully places it into the crate. Maik goes to the window and calls the police on his cell phone. He tells them that anarchists are stirring up the neighborhood and shouting something about Anti-cement. As he speaks, he tosses anarchist propaganda papers out the window into the night. He tells the police he lives on Machnow Street and hangs up. He joins the rest of the friends, who are sitting on a couch, watching old films from their younger days. They laugh about Terror's long mohawk and the way Nele knocks out a policeman with a shovel. Flo points out to Tim that he appears in the video, but he denote seems to care. Present-day Tim is the only one not smiling and laughing. Everyone falls silent as Hotte appears in the film, holding Tim on his shoulders and marching down the street. Hotte sees himself with legs in the film and looks uncomfortable. Melli enters, sees the film, and says Uncle Hotte, your legs are back! Hotte mumbles that he still had his legs that day. Everyone looks uncomfortable. Hotte wheels himself into the kitchen and begins to scream hysterically Once day you have legs, the next day they're gone! One day you have friends, the next day they're gone! You all ran out when the fucking water cannon ran me over! It was war, and you ran away like deserters! Cowards! Tim was the only one who stayed. Tim rushes to Hotte and tries to calm him down. Hotte says that the things they did weren't all in vain and that they were a cause. He seems to be trying to convince himself. Tim says the bad times are over and everything will be like it was before. He hugs Hotte.A car pulls up on Machnow Street and Manowsky gets out. He picks up one of the propaganda papers Maik threw out the window, and looks up at the apartment building.A line of police cars drives down the street with lights flashing. Maik sees them and tells everyone to get up to the roof. Nele doesn't want to leave Hotte behind, but Tim and Hotte explain that the police never take him away, because he is crippled and it would be too controversial.
Down below, the police begin to ram open the front door of the apartment building. One policeman leads Manowsky away even as Manowsky protests that they are colleagues. Manowsky tells a nearby cameraman to get out of there, and when the cameraman ignores him, Manowsky angrily punches the man and knocks him out.
On the roof, Tim, Nele, Melli, Flo, and Maik watch the police load the crate containing their bomb into a truck. It'll all be over in four hours, says Tim.
After the police leave, the five friends walk around the apartment building. Tim says they can move in together, like before. The others stare at him, and Nele points out that they all have jobs now. Maik says they shouldn't be seen together for at least 14 years. They never knew each other, he says. Maik and Nele turn to leave. Flo tells Maik he could have put that differently, and Maik replies that he has to tell it like it is. Tim says it's okay and takes Flo's hand. Flo says she can't go with him. Maik sarcastically asks if there will be a wedding. Flo says she only has until Friday at nine, implying that she is engaged to be married then. Tim turns and angrily runs off.In a slow-motion shot, Tim runs down the street, crying. He runs across the hoods of some cars, then slips and falls in the street. He gets to his feet and throws a rock through the window of a shop. The window displays a picture of a happy couple. Tim's throwing the rock and the window's shattering are shown multiple times. Tim collapses in the street. He is next seen in the back of a police van along with a few policeman. He is still crying.In the basement of the barracks, four men leave the crate with the new bomb inside the evidence locker -- too far from the film to ensure it is destroyed.In the gym, Manowsky, Henkel, and the commissioner watch the film from the camera just before Manowsky punched the cameraman. Manowsky says he was close, but his own men got in his way. He promises to round up the anarchists, and calls the commissioner by his first name, Ralf. The commissioner says he is replacing Manowsky with Henkel. Manowsky glances at Henkel and says he will never work for that jerk. Henkel switches off the film. The commissioner puts an arm around Manowsky's shoulder and tells him he can retire early. Manowsky protests that he does not want to retire, that he just turned sixty, and that he is about to catch the anarchists. Ralf, I thought we were friends, says Manowsky. The commissioner gives him a grim look and walks out of the room.Inside the evidence locker, the ticking of the bomb can be heard. The lid of the crate pops off and Hotte emerges. Because of his missing legs, he can fit inside the crate. He sees the reels across the room and whispers I knew it.
Tim sits on a bench in the barracks. A policemen asks his place of residence, and Tim says he lives on Machnow Street.
In the evidence locker, Hotte removes the bomb from the crate. He uses a rolling cart as a makeshift wheelchair, and wheels himself and the bomb across the room. He sticks the bomb in a box of the confiscated film reels. 90 minutes remain on the bomb's timer.
In the briefing room, Manowsky packs his bag. Pritt tells him they will miss him. Manowsky leaves without a word.
In the evidence locker, Hotte shuts the gate and looks through it to see the bomb next to the reels.
In the barracks, Manowsky and Pritt pass Tim in a hallway, led by a guard. As Tim exits the building, Manowsky turns and looks suspiciously at him, then begins to run after him. Manowsky soon gives up the chase and snatches the papers Tim's guard is carrying.
In the evidence locker, Hotte finds the door locked and the power out, so he cannot open even the emergency door. He swears and turns toward a phone on the wall.
Tim trudges down Machnow Street toward his apartment.
Hotte looks in his address book and dials a phone number.
In Maik's office, a man protests to Maik that Maik told him to sell at 90. Maik says he was not himself when he said that. A woman holds out a phone for Maik, and he irritably waves her away. Maik tells the man to get the other people off his back.
At her home, Nele is too distracted by her baby to answer the phone.
At her home, Flo asks her fiancee, Konrad (Oliver Mommsen) to answer the ringing phone. He sits on the counter where she is doing her makeup, and strokes her face. In a minute, he says.
In the evidence locker, Hotte looks at the ticking bomb. He frantically flips through his address book.
Tim walks toward the apartment building. Bülent sees him and offers him 50 marks for all his junk. Bülent increases his offer to 100 marks, then 120, but Tim ignores him.
A light blinks on Terror's answering machine as Hotte leaves him a message. Hotte says he is trapped down in the basement.
Bülent follows Tim into his apartment, now offering him 150 marks, because I like you. Tim does not see Hotte, and asks Bülent where Hotte is. When Bülent does not tell him, Tim grabs Bülent and pulls back his fist to hit him. Bülent swears he does not know, and then answers his ringing phone as Tim pins him against the wall. Bülent hands his phone to Tim. Tim takes the phone and hears Hotte's voice. 150 plus the phone, because I like you, says Tim. He snatches a wad of cash from Bülent and runs off.
Over the phone, Hotte tells Tim that Hotte had a plan but it got messed up. Tim says he'll come to rescue Hotte.Terror shows up at Nele's apartment, holding his answering machine. He tells Nele that Hotte needs them like he needed them after the accident. Nele asks him what's wrong.
A taxi pulls up in front of the barracks, and Tim gets out. He hands the driver Bülent's cash. The driver gives Tim some rope and metal bars from the trunk. As the taxi drives off, Tim throws the rope over the fence outside the barracks.
In Maik's office, Terror plays Hotte's message for Maik and Nele. Terror says Hotte needs them like he needed them after the eviction. Terror wants to use this second chance he now has. Maik is indifferent. Terror and Nele march off, but Maik stares uncertainly after them.
Tim climbs up a wall in the barracks with his rope. He is still on the phone with Hotte, who says he is terrified. The bomb's timer shows 33 minutes. Trying to calm Hotte, Tim reminds him of a gag they pulled in a restaurant once. Hotte begins to reminisce about the time they spent together as Tim sneaks through a room full of sleeping policemen. Hotte says he never thanked Tim properly for all their good times. A drowsy policemen enters the room, and Tim hides behind a bunk, but the man climbs into that very bunk. He is too tired to notice Tim hiding there, but he can hear the phone, and says Shut up! before falling asleep. Tim rolls his eyes and leaves the room.Maik follows Terror and Nele out of his office, trying to convince them to stop. Nele says they're going to rescue Hotte, and asks if Maik is with them. Maik says no -- he is an asshole, but a free asshole. Terror takes Maik's car keys from his pocket and Terror and Nele climb into Maik's car. Maik changes his mind and joins them, saying Make way for an asshole. Terror haphazardly drives off.As Tim runs across a courtyard, Hotte continues to talk about how tough the last few years have been. Tim is startled by guard dogs barking, but he manages to calm and silence them. On the other end of the phone, Hotte hears a clank. He falls silent and does not respond to Tim. Tim runs on.
Tim enters the basement and hugs Hotte. The two look up to see Manowsky standing next to the reels and their bomb. Nice pictures, he says, holding up a copy of their Group 36 poster. And what's that? he asks, pointing to the bomb. He tells Tim to come along, and then asks him if he's waiting for his friends. He tells Tim not to risk himself for his friends, because they wouldn't do the same for Tim. As Manowsky speaks, Terror, Nele, and Maik climb over the fence outside the barracks. Friends are overrated, says Manowsky. He says that battle lines are now drawn between winners and those who refuse to sell out. Tim glares at him. Manowsky tosses a pair of handcuffs on the floor in front of Tim.Terror, Flo, and Maik sneak through the same sleeping quarters as Tim. They are startled by Terror's phone ringing. He answers and hears Flo on the other end. Again, a policemen sleepily tells them to shut up. Terror hangs up the phone.
At her wedding, Flo looks concernedly at her phone. She tells Konrad that they need to talk.In the evidence locker, Tim stares from the handcuffs to Manowsky, apparently considering attacking him. Manowsky reminds Tim that Manowsky can shout and bring all the men in the building running. Tim picks up the handcuffs, puts them on, and turns his back to Manowsky. As Manowsky approaches him, gloating, Tim suddenly head-butts him and tackles him to the floor. As Hotte cheers Tim on, Tim chokes Manowsky with the handcuffs. Hotte's shots bring Terror, Nele, and Maik into the room. They rush to hug Hotte, and pull Tim off Manowsky.
At her wedding, Flo tells Konrad that she must leave. He protests, but she says she has no choice. She kisses him dispassionately and walks out of the party.In the basement, the friends remove Tim's handcuffs and use them to chain Manowsky to the cage. Tim roots through the reels of film and announces that he found the one that incriminates them. He takes it and the bomb and begins to run out. How far do you think you'll get? asks Manowsky. I'm a witness. Tim places the bomb in front of Manowsky and says There is no witness. The others tell Tim to forget Manowsky. I don't get it, says Hotte. Everyone's been a little crazy since then. Maybe there was something in the tear gas. Tim looks Manowsky in the eye and tells him Manowsky was right -- the battle lines are drawn between the winners and those who refused to sell out. He tosses the handcuff keys to the floor where Manowsky can reach them, and the friends rush out of the basement.An alarm sounds. Policemen wake up and don their uniforms as the friends put on masks. Tim carries Hotte on his shoulders. The police chase the friends across the courtyard, but the friends manage to get into a shed and lock it behind them. Outside, Henkel takes a megaphone and addresses them. He gives them thirty seconds to come out. Manowsky emerges from the basement and stares at the mob of police. They break open the shed and peer into the darkness. Suddenly a jet of water hits them, knocking them down on top of one another. The five friends emerge from the shed in a water cannon. Manowsky grins as he sees Henkel get drenched. The water cannon barrels straight through the security gate. This is shown multiple times. The friends jump out, and turn to see more police chasing them. A truck pulls up and Flo jumps out, calling for the friends to hurry. They pile into the truck and drive off. Henkel swears and orders an extensive manhunt. They won't get far, he tells Manowsky. He asks Manowsky if they were the Machnow Street gang, but Manowsky lies to Henkel that they were wearing masks and could not be identified. Henkel urges Manowsky to tell him, saying that Henkel and Manowsky will be heroes. I can't remember anything, says Manowsky. A real blackout -- all those years on duty. We breathed the same stuff as the anarchists. Maybe there really was something in the tear gas. Henkel says that there's still plenty of evidence in the basement, and orders Pritt to get forensics. Just then, there is an explosion, and Manowsky laughs heartily.The friends pile out of the van and run up a stairway towards a train platform. Hotte asks Tim to put him down. Tim does, and sits beside Hotte on the stairs. Hotte says that if Hotte learned to surf the internet, it would be a great career opportunity. I can't take care of you forever, he tells Tim. They chuckle and hug. From the top of the stairs, Maik calls to them.As the sun rises, all six of the friends collapse into a train car, laughing. Maik holds up the reel of film that incriminates them, and they laugh and unroll it. Tim piles up the film and pulls out his lighter. What to do in case of fire? he asks. Let it burn, they all answer, and Tim lights the film. Terror and Nele look at each other as if about to kiss, but Hotte stops them. Tim and Flo give each other the same look.
The friends step off the train, with Maik now carrying Hotte. Maik says Hotte is heavy for a half-pint, and Tim starts to say something, but Hotte jokingly says he'll get even with Maik. They all walk across a bridge, Maik now pushing Hotte in a shopping cart. Nele asks Maik to borrow a 20, and Hotte reminds Maik that Maik is broke now, just like the rest of them. They all turn to see Tim standing on the handrail of the bridge. Yes! he cries victoriously, holding out his arms. He runs to join them, and they all walk away together, laughing.

title: The Bell Jar
synopsis: Based on Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar Esther Greenwood (Marilyn Hassett) dances turning around and around. She speaks directly to the camera, saying that she has won a scholarship and that she is a very proper New England girl. She arrives to college by bike, and a friend wishes her luck. All the teaching body have gathered to hear the announced of the winner. The head of the English Department announces the winner of the Mary Elizabeth Harrison Award because that person has proved consistently an ability to write poetry along the year. All heads to Esther Greenwood, the winner of the award, but she doesn't look happy or satisfied about it - she just ignores the stares and keeps on dribbling on a notebook. Finally, she reacts, stands up and smiles to everybody in acceptance of the award.Later, she goes to meet the boy she likes Buddy Willard (Jameson Parker); they are alone in a bedroom, presumably his at his parents'. He proposes to her instead of having sex - this is the 50's, and premarital sex is very much frowned upon. He says that his mother says that marriage is the only way, living in sin is unthinkable and his mother says that people who have sex out of marriage end up in hell. They kiss and seem to be about to have sex, but she stops him. He has plans to study Medicine, and Esther worries that in his plans, there is no education for her. He says that she may go to college as well, and goes back to the topic of what will happen when he will have his practice. She inquires about his previous love affairs - he has had several, a waitress, another woman. He says that for a guy it is different, and sex may not always lead to have an emotional attachment. He assumes that she is still a virgin, and she finds it offensive. She finally admits that she has never sex with any man; this secretly relieves and satisfies him. He asks whether she has ever seen a naked man, and she says she hasn't. He asks her whether she would like to see one - referring to himself, of course. She finally says she is interested in doing that. He starts to undress while she munches on something. She laughs when she sees him on his undies. When he takes his underwear off, the light goes off, so she has to make do with the weak light from the street lamp coming in from outside the window. It's pitch dark anyway, and we don't get to see his willy. She laughs and directs his positioning. Immediately, he tells her that it's her turn to strip - she wasn't expecting that and argues that he has already seen a naked woman. She tries to laugh it off but he presses on. He tells her that she is really beautiful. He kisses her and wants to have sex with her. She finally stops him, screaming and crying. He asks what the matter was, as it seems an exaggerated reaction. She says that she doesn't know what the matter is.Esther speaks with her afraid about the incident. She found particularly annoying that he put away his clothes very neatly when he undressed. Esther saw his dick and his balls, and he compares everything with a turkey.
Esther is very excited because she has won a four-week trip to New York to work at a women's magazine, all expenses paid, including the hotel. Mrs Greenwood (Julie Harris), her mother, doesn't like the idea and can't wait to tell her - New York is a dangerous and dirty place, which could be either very hot or very cold. Esther doesn't appreciate the comments and becomes serious and detached. Mrs Greenwood and Esther are walking while pushing their bikes - they are going to have a picnic by the banks of a small river - the day is glorious, and they choose an area close to the water to the shade of trees. The mother says that her father would have been really proud of her. Esther was an A-student, and once she arrived home crying because she thought the teacher would give her a B, something which didn't happen. Her mother only regrets that Esther didn't have more friends. Esther denies to have been a lonely child. The mother takes a photo of her, and tells her to stop fooling around putting an apple on her mouth. The mother tells her that Esther has become la créme of the world, but Esther regrets not having so much money and silk sweaters as her classmates; some of them even had horses that they would take to school. Her mother says something obvious - that happened because those girls' parents were rich. The mother changes the subject, and says that she has joined a folk dancing class. Both laugh about the ridiculous hand-made hat she has made. Esther asks why she hasn't married again, and her mother says it's complicated. Esther says that she may find somebody during the dancing lessons, but the mother says that it would have to be somebody her daughter likes. Esther thinks that quite a ridiculous notion, as she doesn't even live at home anymore, but Mother says that during the holidays she lives there. Esther asks why she didn't let her go to Dad's funeral. Mother says that Esther was too young and that he didn't suffer. Mother doesn't want to keep on talking about that, but Esther complains that she doesn't even know what he died from. Mother ends up saying that some things are better left alone. Esther would do anything her father wanted, although on some other occasions she used to have a temper as a child. Mother seems to be jealous of Esther and her father's close relationship. She wants to know if there was any blood - finally, her mother starts crying.They finally go to a restaurant with John Gilling (Scott McKay), a rich man who has invited them and will pay. He makes Joan (Donna Mitchell) uncomfortable, even mentioned her alcoholic mother. Gilling stands up and asks for an ovation - he drunkenly sings; everybody joins in, even Mrs Greenwood - not Esther and Joan. Joan and Esther walk hand in hand in the night. Joan thinks that in ten years she will be dead. Esther cuts Joan when she speaks about death the same as her mother cut her. She mentions that it's possible that she ends up doing the same things than her mother. She wonders if she should marry a nice boy and get over with all worries.Another night, her boyfriend is pressing her again about marrying before leaving. She mentions that she wants to be a writer, and he tells her that they would lead a comfortable life with plenty of kids and that she could write while the children are in bed; he promises that he will wash the dishes for her. Later, they drunkenly walk. Esther watches a fashion catwalk.Esther is going to an elite college. Her mother is already preparing her. Esther and Joan speak about Mrs Tenner, their expelled old teacher, while they drink. Joan seats close to Esther, who starts thinking about ways of committing suicide. It is suggested that Joan is a Lesbian who is attracted to her.The editor tells about her professional life and old jobs, and tells Esther that her A marks won't help her in a professional life. When Esther insists that she wants to be a poet, but the editor seems to mock her off. Later, Esther throws all her toys to the floor and stays awake staring at the ceiling. Joan hugs and consoles her. Finally, they go to a party. Buddy and her dance. They go out to a garden and he tries to have sex with her - she rejects him and bites his face. He ends up screaming slut while she runs away. She arrives home and throws all her clothes away. She screams on the window, naked except for her undies. A dog is barking in the distance. She seems to be having a breakdown.Her mother recommends her to go outside more. Dr Gordon starts treating Esther, as he thinks she's mentally disturbed. Mrs Greenwood wants to teach Esther shorthand, so that she may take a job in the future, but Esther wants to go to university. Esther spills milk all over her mother's notebook - there is a tug-of-war between them two, with Mrs Greenwood screaming stop it!, stop it! This time it is electroshock for Esther; she is forced to take them; afterwards, she can't even walk on her own - she becomes a zombie. Dr Gordon thinks that she's improving. She cries and laughs because her mother won't take her to Boston.She writes on a mirror with lipstick that she is visiting Daddy. She looks around for the tombstones until she finds the right one; she gives him his old bad. Coming back home, she tries to cut her wrists, but later she gives up and has plenty of pills. She puts on red lipstick which makes her look like a clown. Finally, she is saved in the nick of time and sent again to the mental hospital.Dr Nolan (Anne Jackson) is more helpful, although after two months she realises that she has not improved. Dr Nolan puts her again on shock treatment, but this time she does it the right way. She gives her anesthetics, and when she wakes up she is already in bed. She feels a little bit better and she can have a normal conversation with Dr. Nolan.Her mother visits her. Esther tells her other to knock on the door. Her mother says I am your own other and enters anyway. Mrs Greenwood talks about the terrible trip. She has even brought a bouquet of roses for her. Mrs Greenwood asks what she has done wrong. Esther says she is sorry if she disappoints / embarrashes her. Mrs Greenwood leaves. Dr Nolan asks Mrs Greenwood not to visit for a while. Esther admits to Dr Nolan that she hates her mother.Joan visits Esther, who's returning from a biking trip. Esther is actually happy to see her. Joan is also staying at the hospital as well, as she couldn't handle living in the real world. She spoke to some of the people of the ladies' magazine. It looks like Joan's father is a crossdresser. Esther is a little nervous, and can't believe that Joan has realy tried to kill herself.Buddy visits Esther. He has started Medicine and hasn't found it easy. She hasn't forgiven him for the attempted rape. Buddy wants her to follow him to an internship in New Jersey, and takes for granted she will go with him. But she refuses - she still wants to be a poet. Buddy can't believes what he hears.Joan and Esther take a long stroll. Joan admits that he used her crossdressing father's razor to try to commit suicide. Joan hugs and kisses her tummy. Esther finally realises Joan's feelings for her. Esther stays frozen and eventually runs away, leaving Joan on her own, crying.Dr Richards (Gil Rogers) asks Esther to locate Joan. She finds her body - Joan had hung herself. Dr Nollan hugs her.The treatment will finally work.---written by KrystelClaire

title: Men in Black II
synopsis: The Columbia torch buzzes then flashes like a neuralizer.A video shows Mysteries in History: Episode 27 -- Men in Black (the host: Peter Graves narrates): Although no one has been able to prove their existence, a quasi-government agency known as the Men in Black supposedly carries out secret operations here on Earth in order to keep us safe from aliens throughout the galaxies. Here is one of their stories that (making quotations marks with his fingers) 'never happened', from one of their files that doesn't exist. Crude props and effects accompany the story:1978. Leaders of Zartha flee their planet in order to escape the clutches of the evil Kylothian Serleena. (Serleena is represented by a jumbled mass of hoses). Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring with them their greatest treasure -- the Light of Zartha -- a cosmic force so powerful, that, in the wrong hands, it could spell the annihilation of Zartha. The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna (Paige Brooks), beseeched the Men in Black to hide the Light from Serleena. But they had no choice. Intervention would have meant the destruction of the Earth. (Serleena's space ship lands. It looks like an 8-ft tall metal ice cream drumstick with three landing legs.) However, in an act of galactic bravery, the Men in Black subdued Serleena, allowing the Zarthans to escape so they might hide the Light on another planet. Serleena, released from her captors, vowed that the Light would be hers, and that she would destroy any planet that stood in her way. (The reenactment ends.)Peter Graves finishes: And so, never knowing what happened, the people of Earth were once again saved by a secret society of protectors known as the Men in Black.Over the opening credits, Serleena's space ship flies through space, destroying planets it passes. It finally reaches Earth in July 2002.A dog in New York Central Park barks at the sky. The dog runs and gets away from the owner. Serleena's ship crash-lands in Central Park. The landing legs protrude and then extend to upright the ship. Out of the bottom opening, a tiny creature (Serleena) ejects onto the ground. The dog catches up to the ship (which is only a few inches tall) and barks at the creature, which looks like a strange mouthless serpent. The serpent's head opens up and roars loudly, scaring the dog away. The serpent slithers across the ground, coming across a magazine. Wind blows the pages open to an ad for Victoria's Secret; the female model wears black lingerie. The head opens wide and then hundreds of serpents come out, screeching and shrieking, forming a full-sized replica of the model in the magazine (Lara Flynn Boyle). Immediately after Serleena fully forms, a rapist dressed in leather grabs her and holds a knife to her neck. He licks her and tells her that she tastes good, and then drags her to a nearby bush. Hidden from view, Serleena roars and eats the man, his legs visible as she eats him upside down. Serleena says, Yeah, you too. She walks back from the bush, her stuffed stomach sloshing and gurgling, and then looks at the ad again. She growls then walks back to the bush and vomits the rapist, then comes back out slim again, carrying his clothing, then walks away.Men in Black (MiB) Agent J, Jay, (Will Smith) and his latest partner, Agent T, Tee, (Patrick Warburton), encounter a flower protruding from a sidewalk grating. Jay tells Tee, Nothing fancy, no heroics, by the book this time. Tee replies, Got it, then kicks the flower. Jay talks into the grating, telling Jeff that they're wondering what he's doing here. Tee kicks the flower again, and Jay looks at him, irritated. Jay continues his rebuke of Jeff, reiterating their arrangement: as long as Jeff stays within the E, F, and R subway lines, he can eat all the inorganic matter he wants. Tee grabs the flower and pulls on it, asking worm boy what he's doing. The grating shakes and Jay tries to calm Jeff. Jeff, a giant worm hundreds of feet long, bursts through the grating. Jeff takes Tee screaming with it into the air, holding onto the flower on its head. As Jeff takes Tee up, Jay apologizes to Jeff for his partner, who is new and kind of stupid. Jeff throws Tee onto the ground, and then withdraws back into the hole. Jeff's tail bursts out of the ground nearby and knocks Jay screaming into a fruit stand.Jay jumps into the first hole, landing on Jeff as it speeds through a subway tunnel. Jay bumps his head on the overhead, and then holds onto the flower. Jay's head knocks into some passing overhanging metal, and then he injects Jeff with the tranquilizer. After dodging more overhanging metal and some signals he pokes his hand and bumps his head again. Commuters are waiting by a station. They watch a subway train pass by, then watch Jeff pass by shrieking the other direction with Jay yelling. The commuters look back at their phones, magazines, and newspapers as if nothing abnormal happened. Jay has the hypo ready and raises it up to inject Jeff again, but it throws him screaming through the window of the subway car up ahead. Jay gets up and shows his MiB ID card to the passengers, telling them that he's from the Transit Authority. He tells them to move to the forward car because there's a bug in the electrical system, but no one even notices him. Jay repeats his request, telling them that there's a bug in the electrical system, then looks back. On cue, Jeff takes a bite out of the rear of the subway car, then the passengers scream and run to the forward car. Jay sarcastically tells them to sit down because it's only a 600-foot worm. Jeff takes another bite of the subway car. Jay tells the motorman, Capt. Larry Bridgewater (Peter Spellos), to put the hammer down, but he tells Jay that he decides what happens on the train. Jeff then takes a bite out of that subway car, and Capt. Bridgewater rushes to the control console. Jay walks to the rear of the subway car and threatens Jeff with his blaster, so Jeff closes its mouth and stops chasing them. Sparking as metal drags the ground, the shredded subway car limps into the 81st Street Station. Jay announces the arrival to the passengers. He steps out and zaps the passengers with his neuralizer, then sarcastically thanks them for participating in New York City's drill; had it been an actual emergency, they would have been eaten. He then lectures them about not listening, being ignorant and seeing it all, and ignoring his request to move to the next car. They recover, and Jay zaps them with the neuralizer again. He thanks them for participating in a drill, and hopes they enjoy the new smaller, more energy efficient subway cars. Jay walks away and zaps the motorman too.Jay calls MiB headquarters to secure the perimeter and to send a clean up crew to 81st and Central Park West. He then orders MiB to revoke Jeff's movement privileges immediately and escort him back to the Chamber St. station. He finally requests a check of the expiration date on the unipod worm tranquilizer. When he climbs the stairs out of the station, he tells two men that the station is closed for a drill; they become indignant. Jay says, You're welcome.Jay sits on a bench and Tee comes back to sit with him. Tee knows that he didn't go by the book. Jay asks him when he last looked at the stars, and if he ever felt alone in the universe. Tee isn't much for conversation. Finally Jay takes Tee to eat some pie.Scrad (Johnny Knoxville), a two-headed humanoid alien, returns to his place after a night on the town. His other head grows out of his back on a tentacle -- it's his smaller twin Charlie (Johnny Knoxville) whom he keeps in a backpack; both are equally stupid. Scrad is scolding Charlie for talking behind my back and chasing away a woman at a bar. Scrad turns around and sees Serleena, but doesn't recognize her. Charlie tries his pick-up line on her. Serleena strangles them with her serpent tentacles, and Scrad finally recognizes her. She tells him that she got his message, and asks where the Light is. Charlie wants $50 million to tell her, but Serleena puts tentacles through their ears and noses. Scrad tells her that although they couldn't find the Light, they tracked it to a guy who might know where it is; he runs a pizza parlor on Spring St. They all leave.Jay and Tee eat pie at the Empire Diner. It has a flying saucer sticking out of the roof, as if it crashed. Tee starts blubbering because he knows that Jay's going to neuralize him. Jay tells him to stop making a scene, and then asks him why he joined MiB. Tee replies that after six years in the Marines, he likes to serve, likes the action, and likes to protect the planet. Jay tells him that since he likes being a hero, he joined the wrong organization. Jay asks Tee if he heard of James Edwards (himself), but Tee says no. Jay says that he saved the lives of 85 people on the subway, but no one knows that he exists; therefore, how can anyone ever love him. Tee sobs loudly some more. Jay zaps Tee with the neuralizer. Jay tells Tee to get married and have a bunch of kids. As Jay leaves, he tells a waitress that his buddy is kind of shy, but thinks that she is hot. The waitress and Tee smile at each other.At Famous Ben's Pizza of Soho, Ben (Jack Kehler) (Laura's boss) presents Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) with the Employee of the Month plaque on the wall. She gets a case of Mountain Dew from the basement. When she returns to the parlor, Serleena is holding Ben in the air, and is demanding that he give her information about the Light of Zartha. Ben claims that he doesn't know anything. Laura calls on the phone to report a robbery, then the back door pops open. Serleena repeatedly orders the dense Scrad to check on the door, so Laura hides under the counter. Scrad reports that the wind blew the door open. Serleena tells Ben that although she traveled the universe for 25 years looking for the Light, it never left Earth; they (the Zarthans) kept it on Earth. Ben still claims that he doesn't know what she's talking about. Laura peeks over the counter. Serleena tells Ben that even though they hid the Light, she will find it, and then Zartha will be theirs (the Kylothians). Ben finally answers in a deep alien voice that she's too late; at midnight the Light will leave the 3rd planet and be back home. Serleena growls then slashes him with a tentacle, splitting him in two and killing him, and his skin (a rubber-like suit) falls to the floor. Charlie complains that Ben is dead, and they didn't get any information from him. Serleena reminds the idiot that Ben said third planet. Serleena tells them that the Light is on Earth, and she knows who will tell her where it is. She takes a pan of pizza and they all leave. Laura cries silently while she sits on the floor behind the counter. Thunder rumbles then she looks up and it rains.Jay returns to MiB headquarters. The guard (Alpheus Merchant) wonders if Jay ever goes home and remarks that he neuralized another partner. When he goes to the customs bay, Jay immediately gives orders to various personnel how to do their jobs. He finally asks why a dead Tricrainasloph is going through passport control. (It looks like a giant pink blob with many tentacles.) Several men are trying to move it, including using a pallet jack. Jay goes to Zed's office, and Zed (Rip Torn) congratulates him on his work at the subway. Jay asks Zed what he has for him. Zed replies that others work at MiB too and can handle it. Jay asks again, but Zed refuses again. Jay tells Zed that he'll be in the gym if Zed needs him, so Zed finally tells him about the killing at the pizza parlor. Zed tells Jay to take Tee with him and make a report. Jay tries to tell Zed about Tee, but Frank (the alien talking pug) (voiced by Tim Blaney) comes in and interrupts them. Zed tells Jay to stop neuralizing MiB personnel, but Jay says that Tee was crying in the diner. Jay adds that Elle (Dr. Laurel Weaver, Linda Fiorentino, seen in Men in Black) doesn't count, because she wanted to go back to the morgue. Zed tells Jay that he needs a partner and Frank volunteers.In the garage, Frank, wearing a black suit, runs to keep up with Jay. Jay makes him remove the suit. Frank then talks endlessly as Jay brings his car out with a remote: a black 2003 Mercedes-Benz E-Class W211. A man (later revealed as the automatic pilot) is at the wheel. Jay drives down the street, and Frank hangs his head out the window while singing the song I Will Survive. Jay makes Frank come back inside the car, but he hums the song instead. Finally Jay makes him be quiet.When they reach Famous Ben's Pizza, Frank wants to do the good cop/bad cop routine, but Jay tells him to just shut up. Jay meets two MiB agents in the parlor, who tell him that there's a phosphorous residue on the wall and floor, which they sent to MiB for analysis. Frank makes a joke about Ben, still on the floor: Zero percent body fat. The two MiB agents laugh but stop when Jay stares at them. They tell Jay that there was a witness, Laura Vasquez, whose name they wrote on a napkin. The napkin shows a pizza slice pointing at the Statue of Liberty, whose torch points at a star in the sky. Another MiB agent in the kitchen is questioning Laura, who wants answers of her own. Jay goes to the kitchen to handle it, but makes Frank stay there and sniff around. The agent in the kitchen is telling Laura that everything will be all right, but Jay counters that and makes him leave. When she describes what she saw, Jay tells her that Ben's skin isn't really skin, but is a protoplasma polymer chemically similar to material used in baseball card gum. He then takes her to eat pie.At Empire Diner, Laura tells Jay that Serleena kept asking Ben about a light, the Light of Zartha. He asks her if she's OK, but she sarcastically tells him that an hour ago a man she's known her entire life vanished in front of her eyes because of a woman with things coming out of her fingers and a two-headed guy with the IQ of a cannoli, but everything is OK. Laura says that she knows what she saw, and asks Jay what she's supposed to believe. He tells her that he's a member of a secret organization that polices and monitors alien activity on Planet Earth; Ben was an alien, and so were the people who killed him. Jay says that he doesn't know why they killed Ben, but he will find out. Jay pulls out his neuralizer and points it at her, and she expects that he'll kill her. He tells her that it will flash and put everything back the way it was before. She wonders that after he flashes her, if she'll know it's him if she sees him again. He replies that he'll see her but she won't see him. He points the neuralizer at her, but she tells him that it must be hard and lonely. A bicycle bell rings, and Jay looks out the window to see two people riding a tandem bicycle again, their clothing and the bike covered with lights (as seen in Men in Black). One of Jay's devices beeps, and he puts away the neuralizer. She asks about the flashy thing, and he tells her that he'll flash her some other time. Jay goes outside and finds Frank in the car barking rhythmically to the song, Who Let the Dogs Out (by Baha Men). Jay turns off the radio and then gets in and starts the car. Frank asks Jay if he told the girl that he loves her, but he replies that she's just a witness to a crime. Frank knows that Jay is attracted to her, but Jay refuses to take his advice.Jay and Frank arrive at the park where Serleena landed and killed the rapist. Many MiB personnel are there and have secured the area. When Jay and Frank get out, Frank tries to act important, telling everyone that he's Agent Eff, Agent Jay's new partner. An agent laughs at Frank, so Frank attacks him. Jay goes inside a tent and finds Serleena's spaceship, then calls Zed on a communicator, which looks like a cross between a videophone, a Game Boy, and a PDA. Jay tells Zed that the space ship is Kylothian, Class C. Zed replies that it's Serleena's. Jay tells Zed that the witness said that the perps were looking for the Light of (Zed finishes) Zartha. Zed replies that it doesn't make sense, because the Light is not on Earth; they took care of that a long time ago. Jay retorts that obviously they didn't. Zed tells Jay that it's very bad news; 25 years ago the Zarthans came to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena. Jay says that they don't do that. Zed replies that it's why he ordered it off the planet. Jay asks Zed if he's sure the Light isn't still here, because of the Kylothian ship in the park. Zed replies that he's positive, because his best agent carried it out, just as if he ordered Jay to do it. Jay says that they should ask the agent, but Zed replies that they can't -- he's dead -- he works at the Post Office. Jay is shocked. Zed tells him that if Serleena gets to Kay before they do, he's dead; Earth's existence may depend on Kay's knowledge, but Jay wiped out Kay's memory of it. Zed orders Jay to bring Kay in.Jay and Frank go to retrieve Kay. Frank rambles on about how cool it is to get the great agent Kay, Jay's mentor. They arrive at the small town of Truro, Massachusetts, and Jay tells Frank to stay in the car. Inside the post office, Kay grins when he sees that the former Agent Kay, Kevin Brown (Tommy Lee Jones), is now the postmaster. Kevin is reminding customers to properly wrap their packages. Jay walks up and addresses Kevin as Kay, but he replies, C, Express Mail, two-day air. Jay tells Kevin that although he doesn't remember Jay, they used to work together. Kevin replies that he never worked in a funeral home and asks slick how he can help him. Jay tells him that Kay is a former agent of a top-secret organization that monitors extraterrestrials on Earth; they are the Men in Black, have a situation, and need his help. Kevin tells him to go to the free mental health clinic. Kevin calls the next customer, a girl (Chloe Sonnenfeld) who wants to buy some Rugrats stamps. Jay picks up the girl and sets her back in line. He tells Kevin that there was no coma; it was a cover up. Kevin orders him to leave, but Jay calls him Kay again. Kevin walks to the back office and Jay follows him in. Kevin informs the postal employees that they've had a breach, then orders them to cordon off the area and do a full wipe down, and to escort nonessential civilian personnel off the site (acting like he still works at MiB). As Kevin looks on, Jay researches one of the employees on his communicator. Jay speaks to him in an alien language that sounds like beatboxing. The man (Biz Markie responds in the alien language. All the other employees (including one that looks like Howard Stern) stop work to observe the conversation. Kevin looks around in disbelief as the other employees reveal themselves to be aliens too. Jay tells Kevin that the reason why he's so comfortable there is that just about everybody who works in the Post Office is an alien. Jay opens the mail-sorting machine, revealing a eight-armed alien (Jeremy Howard) instead of machinery. (The song Speed Demon plays.) Kevin removes the alien's cigarette and tells him, No smoking. When Kevin gets back up, the alien puts another cigarette in his mouth and continues sorting mail. Jay catches up to Kevin, who is trying unsuccessfully to start his Jeep. Kevin tells him that in Las Vegas he and his wife saw Siegfried and Roy fly a white tiger around a room; Jay's act is nothing special. Jay responds that when Kevin looks up at the stars he feels like he doesn't know who he is, like he knows more about what's going on out there than down here. Jay tells him that it's why his wife left him and Kevin punches Jay in the nose. Jay tells Kevin that if he wants to know who he really is, to come ride with him; otherwise he can give people their TV Guides. Kevin gets in the car and tells Jay that he's just going for a ride; if things don't add up he will leave. Frank asks Kevin, How's it hanging, but he just stares at the dog.At MiB headquarters, the guard greets Kay, but he doesn't recognize the guard. In the main bay, two men and a flying device greet Kay. Agent Gee (Sid Hillman) is awestruck by Kay, the legend, the most respected agent in the history of MiB, the most feared human in the universe -- in the flesh. He goes to get coffee for Kay, but runs away before Jay can give him his coffee request. Michael Jackson (Michael Jackson) calls Zed from amongst a flock of penguins in Antarctica. He reports that the Drolocks are gone and the treaty is signed. Zed tells him that it's good work. He asks Zed about the position at MiB that Zed promised him, but Zed replies that they're still working on the alien Affirmative Action program. He tells Zed that he wants to be Agent M, but Zed hangs up. Zed greets Kay and tells him that the Earth might be in trouble and he's the only one who can save it. Kay starts quoting the Post Office motto (Neither rain nor sleet nor snow...). Zed tells Jay to get Kay armed, up to speed, and to deneuralization. As Jay and Kay leave, Zed makes Frank stay behind because he needs Jay and Kay together on this assignment. Zed tells Frank that he's looking for a new assistant; although it's not fieldwork, it provides better dental coverage. Frank smiles appreciatively, showing his bad teeth.Jay takes Kay into the tech unit, which holds the most advanced technologies from all over the universe. Kay sees a blue globe on a stand and sticks a finger in the globe. The globe is actually a miniature planet full of tiny aliens, who scream at the finger coming from the sky and run away. Jay hears the screams and tells Kay not to touch it; he quickly removes his finger and says that he didn't do anything. Jay tells Kay to put his hands in his pockets. Jay opens the armory and gives Kay his favorite weapon: the Noisy Cricket (the same weapon Kay issued Jay in Men in Black). Jay then takes Kay to put on the last suit he'll ever wear -- again.After Kay gets his suit, Jay takes Kay to a room with plain white walls. The deneuralizer hangs from the ceiling over a hole in the middle of the floor. Jay explains its operation to Kay: In a few moments, transverse magneto energy will surge through your brain, unlocking information hidden deep and dormant that could hold the key to Earths very survival. Kay points to the deneuralizer (which is the only thing in the room) and asks what it is. Jay replies that it's the deneuralizer, then he sighs.At Earth customs, Scrad/Charlie wait while a customs agent (Peter Spruyt) asks for Serleena's name and planet of origin. She replies, Sylona Gorth. Planet Gorn. Kaluth system. When the agent asks if she has any fruits or vegetables, she motions to Scrad/Charlie and replies, Yeah, two heads of cabbage. The agent asks for her reason of visit, and she replies that it's for education, that she wants to learn how to be an underwear model. She unzips her vest and flashes her bra at the agent. Scrad/Charlie faint; Charlie recovers and yells for help, then attempts CPR on Scrad. Other MiB agents, who were watching Martha Stewart (Martha Stewart) on the big screen TV, run over to help. Serleena shoots her tentacles out and snares the agent who was waiting on her. The alarm sounds and a female voice announces Lockdown. Code 101. on the P.A. system. When Frank hears the alarm he hides behind the tentacles of the dead Tricrainasloph, which has been stuffed into a corner. Serleena subdues the rest of the MiB agents with her tentacles.Jay hears the alarm and tells Kay that there is a breach, and that they're being firewalled and flushed. He helps Kay out of the deneuralizer before it starts. Jay tells Kay that being flushed is like going to a water park, but Kay doesn't know if he ever went to one. There is a loud flushing noise, then blue liquid floods the room. The overhead view shows that the room is shaped like a giant toilet bowl, complete with a seat (and the deneuralizer has retracted). The water swirls through the drain hole, taking Kay and Jay with it. They shoot through clear tubes and end up in two metal capsules in Times Square. The capsule doors open and the water pours out. Jay jokes with Kay, telling him that when Kay was an agent he loved to be flushed. He tells Kay not quit on him. Kay responds with, I save the world, you tell me why I stare at the stars.Jay brings his car to the curb with the remote. He presses a button on the remote, and the automatic pilot gets sucked into the steering wheel. Kay asks if it's standard, and Jay replies that it came with a Black dude, but he kept getting pulled over.Serleena has stuffed the MiB agents in some offices, subdued by her writhing tentacles. As she walks away, she remarks that she could rule this silly little planet with the right set of mammary glands. While driving, Kay brings up MiB surveillance on the computer, which shows that MiB is deserted -- lockdown. He calls Frank on the communicator. Frank tells Jay that some hot-looking biker chick did it. Jay tells Frank to stay where he is, and that he'll keep in touch. Serleena asks Scrad/Charlie if they found Kay. They reply that he's a civilian; he was here to be deneuralized because his memory was erased, but he's gone. They assure Serleena that they will find Kay.Kay finds an old photo of himself in his coat pocket and shows it to Jay. It's the left half of a picture that was cut off, and Kay is smiling and pointing to his right. They both wonder what is means. Kay asks Jay if there is another deneuralizer besides the one at MiB. Jay replies that it's the only official one; the plans leaked out on the Internet a few years ago. Jay finds one for sale on eBay by Jack Jeebs (whom they went to in Men in Black).Jay and Kay arrive at Jeebs' pawnshop at night. Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) greets Jay enthusiastically but is surprised to see Kay, because he thought Kay was retired. Jay tells Jeebs that they need the deneuralizer, but he looks at Kay and asks if Kay remembers him. Kay replies that he doesn't, that he's pretty good with faces, and would remember that (pointing to Jeebs nose). Jeebs laughs because Kay is a neutral. Kay tells Jeebs that he's in the way of his memories, and asks Jeebs if he has the deneuralizer. Jeebs says that he doesn't have it. After a stare down by Kay and Jay, Jeebs remarks that even if he did have it, Jay would blow his head off if it doesn't work and Kay dies, and Kay would blow his head if it works. Jay holds a fission carbonizer to Jeebs' head, so he takes them downstairs to the deneuralizer.Serleena has released MiB's alien prisoners, the scum of the universe, to help her get Kay: a guy with a funny chin and wearing a scarf; a White guy; a bald guy with pointy ears, a misshapen nose, and tendrils on his face; and a Black Guy. She tells them that she needs the Light of Zartha and Kay knows where it is; whoever brings Kay to her gets Earth. She tells Scrad/Charlie to find a deneuralizer because Kay needs it to get his memories back. She then greets Jarra (John Alexander), a very tall alien, who glides forward to meet her.Kay is seated and strapped down in the deneuralizer and Jeebs is giving him safety instructions. Jeebs sticks a tube in Kay's mouth. Jeebs delays by asking Kay irrelevant questions, but Jay shouts at him so he starts the deneuralizer (with an outboard motor). Jeebs tells Jay that he only used the deneuralizer once, to make hot air popcorn with the exhaust. Clamps come down against Kay's head. A strobe light flashes in Kay's face and a large fan spins above the chair, then the chair shakes. Jeebs presses a key on the keyboard, then some eggbeaters spin and a bowling ball goes down a ramp around the deneuralizer chair. A alarm sounds and flashes, then the deneuralizer stops, then all the power there and in New York City goes out. After a few seconds, the power comes back on and the deneuralizer starts back up. The chair shakes violently then tilts back, then ejects Kay gasping (with the seat back) onto the floor. Jay and Jeebs lean over Kay to check on him, and then Kay blows off Jeebs' head with the Noisy Cricket. Jay thinks that Kay is back, but he says that he's not. Jay asks him how he knew that Jeebs' head would grow back, but he didn't know that it would. As his head grows back, Jeebs says that it's the last time he helps out a friend. Jay asks Kay if he remembers anything, but he just says goodbye. As Kay rushes up the stairs, Jeebs tells him that that he never got the updated software for the deneuralizer, and that Kay's brain needs to reboot.Jeebs apologizes to Jay, and hopes that it doesn't affect their friendship, all those years of loyalty and trust, respect for one another. Immediately afterwards, Serleena's henchmen break through the walls, and Jeebs directs them to Jay. They shoot at Jay then ask for Kay, but Jay shoots Jeebs' head then tells them that Kay retired and he's his replacement. The alien with face tendrils jumps through the ceiling and they subdue Jay, throwing him to the floor. Scrad asks Jay where Kay is, but Jay feigns ignorance. The White alien grabs Jay but Jay punches his face, knocking the mask off. The alien looks like the Creature from the Black Lagoon with a lumpy face & head (Corn Face) (Michael Garvey). Jay tells him that he looks like crap, then another alien laughs (the one that looks like a dog with a poop-covered head) (Dog Poop) (Sonny Tipton). Jay corrects himself, saying that that the other alien looks like crap. The Black alien orders that they bend him. Corn Face picks up Jay over his head and starts bending him. Kay walks outside and looks around. He sees: the two lighted guys on the tandem bike; a homeless man pushing a shopping cart, with a crab-like creature with lights for eyes peeking out from under a blanket; two hookers dressed for Halloween; and a USPS mail carrier with a tail hanging out from his shorts. Kay then sees a cockroach crawling on the ground and goes to step on it, but he changes his mind. The roach thanks him. Kay looks up at the stars for a while, and then finally smiles. Corn Face is still bending Jay. Scrad tells the thugs that he thinks Jay is telling the truth, so Corn Face says that he's no good to them. Kay comes in and shoots Dog Poop and Corn Face. He defeats the other thugs using Jay's advice on their weaknesses. The Black guy is Pineal Eye (Kevin Grevioux); Kay removes the hat and pokes his eye. The alien with tendrils on his face is Mosh Tendrils (Derek Mears); Kay pulls his tendrils and slingshots him into the ceiling. When Kay kicks the last thug between the legs, it makes a metallic clank. Jay tells Kay that he's a Ball-Chinnean (Michael Dahlen); Kay pulls down his scarf, revealing testicles, and kicks them, knocking him out. Kay has his memory back and is Jay's partner again. Jay asks Kay what's going on, and what is the Light of Zartha, but Kay doesn't know.Outside, Jay asks Kay why he doesn't remember what the Light of Zartha is. He replies that he must have neuralized himself to keep the information from himself. Kay goes to the driver's side of Jay's car, telling Jay that he always does the driving. Pointing to Kay and himself, Jay replies that Kay and his car are old and busted, and Jay and his car are new hotness. Kay stares at Jay until he gives him the remote.At MiB, Serleena is holding Zed in the air with her tentacles. She releases her tentacles and he falls to the floor, then she kicks him. She tells him that they both need the same thing, and then she kicks him again, knocking him into his chair. She shoves Zed's cell phone to him, but he refuses to bring Kay in. She reminds him that the Light will self-destruct if it's not off the Earth by midnight, annihilating the planet. She tells him that they can both lose or both win, because he doesn't want the Light on Earth any more than she does. Zed dials his phone and hands it to her, telling her that she wins. Michael Jackson answers, still asking Zed if he could be Agent M. Zed knocks Serleena over the head with his lamp then jumps and flips over her. He kicks her in the face several times, but nothing fazes her. She knocks him to the floor with a tentacle, then kicks him in the face and knocks him out. She then notices a tentacle of the dead Tricrainasloph move.Jay tells Kay what the fastest way to MiB is but he passes it. Jay tells him that they need to go to MiB because headquarters has been breached; they have to bust in there, and peel some caps, and split some wigs up in that joint. Kay replies that he's not ready. Jay says that Kay's been gone for five years, which is a long time in this game; he understands if Kay is scared, because he is too. Kay replies that he's not scared, so Jay says that neither is he; he thought they were bonding. Kay tells him that after five years, he's still acting like a rookie by talking about splitting wigs and stepping on caps; it's no wonder Zed brought him back. Jay counters that Zed brought Kay back because he messed up. Kay says that Jay's attitude is creating a very stressful work environment. Jay says that MiB has a stressful work environment. Kay says that Serleena thinks that Kay knows where the Light is, so she broke into MiB to lure him back. Jay adds that it's a trap -- which is why they shouldn't bust into MiB. They go to the scene of the crime: Famous Ben's pizza.Jay tells Kay that he's going to talk to the witness. Kay wonders why he didn't neuralize her, according to MiB procedures, which he quotes. Laura swings a pizza tray at Kay, but he ducks and she hits Jay's face instead. Jay introduces Kay to her. She thanks Jay for sending some agents to watch her last night. Kay rebukes Jay again, quoting MiB procedures. Jay talks about the crime, then Kay notices a photo of Ben holding a large fish. The clouds over the fish were removed, as if done by Photoshop. Jay takes Kay's picture and places it over the photo, matching it perfectly. Jay notices that Kay left himself clues. Kay is pointing at something, so Jay puts his head against the wall (bumping a green key & key ring hanging on the wall), and follows the direction across the room. Kay sees the key and sighs, and tries to stop Jay. Jay reaches a photo on the wall of an astronaut pointing, and repeats his procedure. Kay just shakes his head in disappointment. Jay reaches some pizza boxes stacked on their corners, and wonders who would stack pizza boxes like that. He deduces that the stacker was leaving clues, and that the pizza slice is an arrow. The camera zooms in on the photo then on the key, which is labeled GCT. Kay again tries to stop Jay, but he says that Kay is slowing him down. Jay finally reaches a steel cabinet and takes out a can of anchovy fillets in virgin olive oil. Kay shakes the key and tells Jay that he hopes he's not slowing Jay down. Kay pulls out his deneuralizer but Jay stops him, saying that Laura could be important to him -- to them, and could help them later. Kay puts away his deneuralizer but says that she can't stay there because they (the aliens) will be back, then he walks out. Jay takes her to stay with some of his friends.Jay takes Laura to the Worms' place, a large suite with a low ceiling, and he bumps his head. Jay tells them that MiB is Code 101, and introduces Laura. He stops their catcalls and apologizes for them, but Laura replies that she's dated worse. Jay tells her that the Worms are under suspension right now for stealing from the duty-free shop. Kay comes in and reminds Jay that the car is double-parked. Jay tells the Worms that Laura is very important to him, then adds to them (Jay and Kay), to the stuff they're doing. Kay then leaves. Jay asks them to watch Laura. They are very enthusiastic about it. Jay hands her his communicator in case she needs it and she kisses him. All the worms wooo and laugh. Jay tells her to watch out for Neeble, but has to ask them which one is Neeble; the Worm in the jacuzzi (voiced by Thom Fountain) answers. Jay tells her that it's safe but not to fall asleep, then leaves. The worms start a game of Twister, and Laura smiles.Jay catches up to Kay and reviews Kay's plan because it confuses him: since Kay neuralized himself and erased his memory of the Light of Zartha, he left himself clues; the photo from an old suit points to a key in a pizzeria; the key opens a locker at Grand Central Terminal, which will give them another clue. Kay replies that it's right, because he likes to keep his enemies confused. Jay says that they're all confused.At Grand Central Terminal, Kay tells Jay not to slow him down, and then sends him to get them coffee while he opens the locker. Jay becomes indignant, but Kay says that he doesn't know what's in there and Jay could get hurt. Kay opens the locker, revealing hundreds of tiny aliens in a tiny town. The town is full of discarded ordinary items from Earth, plus miniature buildings from a department store. The aliens hail Kay, and then start to sing the Star Spangle Banner, with Kay's name inserted. Kay asks them if he left anything there. They say that he did: the timekeeper (Kay's watch) -- to illuminate their streets and their hearts. Kay takes back his watch from the clock tower and puts it on, and they panic. Jay takes off his watch and puts it on the clock tower, so they now hail Jay. Kay starts to close the locker, but they tell him that he forgot the commandments on the tablet. They chant, The tablet! The tablet! The mayor (Peter Siragusa), an alien that looks like Moses, says that they have lived by its word, and peace has reigned throughout their world; pass it onto others, that they too may be enlightened. The others chant: Be kind. Rewind. Kay takes the tablet, which is a business card from Tapeworm Video Store. The mayor tells Kay to go back and reconcile his past so that he can move tranquilly into his future. The others chant Two for one, every Wednesday, then Large adult entertainment section in the back. All the aliens then turn around and laugh and rush into a XXX fun zone. Jay says that it's just nasty, and closes the locker. Jay asks Kay what the video card is for, but he doesn't know. Jay then asks Kay what the watch is for. Kay replies that it's to remind him that they have until midnight, which according to his watch is less than an hour away.Kay and Jay arrive at Tapeworm Video. Jay wants to stop chasing ridiculous clues. He wants to get a couple of fission carbonizers and take back headquarters, but Kay tells him that it's all about to make sense. He gives his card to the clerk (Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine), but she says that it hasn't been used in years, before she was born. Kay tells her that he's been away on business. Jay adds, billions of frequent flier miles. The clerk says that it's hard to use them, and then rambles on about wanting to go to Cambodia, how you can get a lobster dinner for a dollar. Kay stops her, so she tells him that he never checked out a video, but reserved one and didn't pick it up. She calls her boyfriend Newton (David Cross), the manager, who comes back from the bathroom. He's paranoid about aliens. He tells Kay that he reserved Episode 27: Light of Zartha, and tells Kay that they've got it.At MiB HQ, Serleena asks Jarra why he was locked up. He replies that Agent Jay caught him siphoning the Earth's ozone to sell it on the black market. She tells him that she needs a spacecraft that can go 300 times the speed of light. He tells her to give him Jay and it will be even. She agrees and gives him until midnight, and then he glides away. Serleena calls Gatbot, which looks like a steel cylindrical trash can, for a special job.Newton takes Kay and Jay upstairs to his bedroom, which he has devoted to aliens. He lives with his mother. Newton's girlfriend tells him that she wants to have his baby. His mother yells to him offering him mini pizza, and he offers some to Kay and Jay. They just stare at him. Newton yells back that they don't want any, then gets the videotape. Jay is relieved that they finally have some hard evidence. Newton starts rambling about aliens and anal probing, but Jay prods him to play the tape.As the video plays, Jay remarks that it looks like Spielberg's work. Newton starts saying the words along with the video, but Kay and Jay stare at him so he stops. When the video talks about the Keeper of the Light, Kay says softly, Lauranna, and Jay looks at him. Kay also says, No. It was night... and it was raining.The scene changes to a black-and-white flashback of the way it actually happened. Serleena tells Kay, You've been very wise. Ambassador Lauranna (Linda Kim) says, Kay, please, if Serleena gets the light, it's the end of our world. Kay replies, Madame Ambassador, if we extend the protection of the light beyond the Earth, we put the Earth itself in jeopardy. We have no choice. We must remain neutral. Serleena asks, Where is it? Kay replies, We're neutral, remember? You want it, go get it. He uses his watch to launch a spaceship. Serleena shouts No! She shoots Lauranna, killing her, and then chases after the spaceship with her own spaceship. Kay bends over Lauranna, and then opens his hand to reveal a bracelet.Back in the present, Kay is crying silently as the video finishes: And so, never knowing it happened, the people of Earth were once again saved by a secret society of protectors... Kay turns off the video and says that he shouldn't have. Jay deduces correctly that they didn't send the Light off the planet and hid it on Earth. Kay says, The Worm Guys, and goes downstairs; he neuralizes Newton's mother. Newton recognizes the neuralizer just before Jay neuralizes Newton and his girlfriend. Jay tells Newton to get contacts instead of his glasses, then to take his girlfriend to Cambodia for a lobster dinner (and to pay more than a dollar); when he gets back from Cambodia he should move out his mom's house. Jay finishes with saying that there are no such things as aliens or Men in Black. Newton takes off his glasses and asks his girlfriend if she wants to go to Cambodia, and she agrees. Newton picks up a shovel as they go downstairs and he calls his mother.While Kay drives, Jay calls Laura on his communicator. She tells him that they (she and the worms) are playing Twister. Jay asks her if she's wearing a bracelet. She replies that she is. Kay asks her if it's glowing, and she replies that it never did that before. (The bracelet is the same one that Kay held in the flashback; the triangle shape on it is glowing now.) Jay tells her that they're on the way. Jay calls Frank and tells him to deactivate the lockdown because they're on the way to the worm guys and they found the Light. Frank is tied up and Serleena acknowledges in Frank's voice. Serleena leaves Frank and calls for Scrad. Frank mumbles, Bitch.Kay asks Jay why he didn't tell Laura that he loved her. Kay knows that Jay is in love with her, which is why he didn't neuralize her; he got emotionally involved. Jay retorts that Kay did the same with Lauranna. Kay tells Jay that he (Kay) put Earth in danger because he got involved, and doesn't want to see Jay make his mistakes.Kay and Jay arrive at the Worm Guys' place; it's wrecked and the Worms are seriously injured. Jay asks them where Laura is. They reply that some dumb two-headed guy took her to MiB headquarters. Kay says that they (Serleena and the others) have the bracelet, and that there's only 39 minutes left, so Kay and Jay leave. The Worm Guys chase after them. Jay asks Kay why she took Laura if she has the bracelet. Kay replies that she also wants him (Kay). They go get some wig-splitting weapons.A man, his wife, and their daughter are watching Martha Stewart on TV. Kay and Jay barge into their apartment. Kay tells them that he used to live there and came to pick up a few things, then moves the thermostat control left and right and left quickly. The back wall of the living room slides up, revealing walls and cabinets full of weapons. Mannix the Worm (voiced by Brad Abrell) remarks that it's a nice place. The Worm Guys, Jay, and Kay get some weapons. Kay closes the back wall with the thermostat then Jay neuralizes the family.Inside MiB headquarters, Jarra has completed constructing a spaceship; pieces of rockets and machinery litter the room. Laura is in the spaceship. A female voice announces on the P.A. that there's 4 minutes to launch. Jarra informs Serleena that her ship is ready, so she tells him to send it to Kyloth now.Outside MiB headquarters, Jay aims his weapon to shoot a hole in the building, but Kay tries to stop him. Jay fires anyway, and they get sucked in and lose their weapons. Kay rebukes Jay for shooting MiB because it's in Code 101 lockdown. A hot dog stand gets sucked in too, and the umbrella plugs up the hole. The guard calmly picks a hot dog off his suit and says that it's about time they got there, because that pretty lady in there is causing all kinds of hell. He resumes reading The Weekly World News.The elevator opens to the MiB main bay, and Gatbot opens up, extending its rotary machine guns. It shoots the elevator full of holes, but Kay, Jay, and the Worms are hiding against the ceiling. Kay tells Jay to get to the launch pad on the roof; the bracelet shows the departure point. He also orders Jay not to come back for him. Kay hangs down and gives cover fire against Gatbot with his blasters while Jay runs to the other elevator, which leads to the roof. Kay then sends the worms through the elevator ceiling to shut off the power to the launch pad so that the spaceship can't take off. Gatbot enters the elevator and Kay throws a grenade down, and then jumps out of the elevator before the doors close and the grenade explodes. Serleena is waiting for him, and captures him with her tentacles.Jay reaches the spaceship, but Jarra blocks his way. Jarra has been locked up for 5 years and 42 days. Jarra drops his cloak to reveal that he's made up of four parts: one large flying ship and three smaller flying ships -- all with his head and torso, and metal tentacles hanging down. One of the smaller Jarras takes away Jay's blaster.Kay tells Serleena that he should have vaporized her when he had the chance. She remarks that he really loved Lauranna. She calls him a silly little man and sticks her tentacle tongue into his ear.Jay tries unsuccessfully to reach the larger Jarra because of the smaller ones. A female voice announces on the P.A. that there's two minutes to launch. Laura tells Jay to go and that she'll be fine, but Jay replies that he's winning. He tells Jarra that he's arresting him for being that ugly and making copies of himself. Jay picks up a scrap pipe and bats away one of the small Jarras, knocking it against a wall and destroying it. Another small Jarra takes Jay away and drops him, but he lands safely on some large clear tubing.The Worm Guys -- Mannix, Neeble, Sleeble (voiced by Greg Ballora), and Gleeble (voiced by Carl J. Johnson) -- walk down a passageway. They forgot Kay's instructions on where to shut off the power.Jay and the large Jarra charge at each other and collide, then Jarra takes Jay around the room. Jay punches a small Jarra and it hits a machine and gets destroyed. Jay covers large Jarra's eyes, then grabs the control lever, then large Jarra crashes into the remaining small Jarra, destroying them both. Jay jumps away in time and lands on the tubing. As Jay struggles to get off the tubing, a female voice announces on the P.A. that there's 30 seconds to launch. Jay finally gets off the tubing then turns off the countdown before it reaches zero. He releases Laura and tells her that he didn't leave her because he never runs out on a fight.Serleena has Kay in the air. She calls Kay an insignificant speck and tells him that he lost. She says that he wasted 25 years of her time for the complete and total annihilation of Zartha, because he went mushy. Kay tells her that she has one last chance to surrender. Serleena asks him how he can stop her, but Kay says that it's not him. Jay shoots her with a large weapon, telling her that her flight has been cancelled, and vaporizing her. Kay falls to the floor.Mannix lands in the control room and presses a random button, turning off all the power in MiB. Kay brings the car over with the remote. Jay tells Laura to give him the bracelet. She tells him that she's going with them, and Kay tells him that she should get in the car too. They drive away, revealing that Serleena was only stunned. The tiny creature sends out tentacles again.As they drive, Laura remarks that it's hard to believe that everyone is after her charm bracelet. Jay replies that she would be surprised how often it's something small like that. Kay tells him them that it's not the Light -- it shows the departure point; if they don't reach the departure point in 11 minutes & 15 seconds the bracelet will go nuclear and destroy all life on Earth. Suddenly Serleena rams the back of the car with her spaceship. Jay tries to stop him, but Kay presses the red button on the shift lever. The car transforms into a flying rocket car, slamming them against the seats. They fly through Times Square with Serleena chasing them. Jay tells Kay that the car is modified to hyper speed. Kay tells them to put on their seatbelts, but they don't. A handle-type steering wheel (with controls similar to that of a game console) comes out of the dash and Jay tells Kay that it's the navigational stalk; he has to use it during hyper speed. Kay grabs the navigational stalk and sends the car upside down; Jay and Laura didn't put on their seatbelts and fall to the ceiling. Serleena shoots the car several times as they fly over New York Harbor. Jay tells Kay how to use the controls and he rights the car; Laura and Jay fall onto the back seat. Jay climbs back into his seat and calls the worms at MiB. Frank and the Worm Guys are drinking martinis and smoking cigars, and Frank is telling them about one of his chicks. Jay tells Frank to use the computer to lock onto Serleenas ship and destroy it. Serleena shoots the car, breaking the communication. Frank says that Jay was the best damn partner a Remoolian could ever have. Kay activates the automatic pilot, which pops up in front of him, but it doesn't work. Jay tells him that it doesn't operate at hyper speed and retracts the automatic pilot. Kay replies that he's used to a steering wheel, but Jay says that it's all they have. Jay asks Kay if his mother ever gave him a Game Boy, buy Kay asks what that is. Jay and Kay switch seats in mid flight. They fly into the subway with Serleena still shooting at them and she calls them idiots. Kay tells Jay that the subway is not the best place to lose her, but Jay shushes him and wonders where Jeff is. Kay asks who Jay is talking about and they see Jeff straight ahead. Jay lands the car at the last second and Serleena flies into Jeffs open mouth, who then chews and swallows her spaceship. The automatic pilot pops up in front of Jay.They land on the rooftop of a tall building. The car transforms back to normal and they get out. Jay tells Kay that they're running out of time and asks him where the Light is, and Kay says that Laura is the Light. Laura is incredulous. Kay tells her that she has a planet to save, but she replies that he has her confused with somebody else; she works part-time at a pizzeria. Kay tells her that two days ago he was running a post office in Truro, Massachusetts; you are who you are. While Kay explains Laura's purpose on Earth, Jay sees the triangular-shaped skylight, which matches the triangle shape on Laura's bracelet, and then pulls out the napkin from Famous Ben's Pizza. Kay is telling Laura that she is the Light; she's the leader of her people, their spirit and their hope; the power is within her to save the planet; I protected you until it was your time. Your time is now. You were hidden on Earth 25 years ago to... Jay looks at the Statue of Liberty then looks up and sees the star. Kay continues: You are going to save a world. You know things before they happen. She replies that she can't; she's a Libra. Kay tells her that she is a Zarthan; when she gets sad it always seems to rain. She replies that lots of people get sad when it rains. Kay tells her that it rains because she's sad. The star emits a bright beam of light onto a large egg-shaped object on the roof, transforming it into a transport pod, and it opens up. Jay leans against the car dejectedly, and then he and Laura look sadly at each other. Even though they realize it's not fair, Jay and Laura accept her destiny. Suddenly Jeff bursts through the skylight, roaring and baring his teeth. Jay shouts at Jeff, saying that he's not in the mood for him, and orders him to get back in the subway. Jeff bursts apart, revealing a giant serpent: Serleena. As Kay takes Laura to the transport pod, Serleena shoots out tentacles toward Laura. Jay jumps in front of Laura, so the tentacles get him instead. Jay shouts at Laura that she has to go. Kay shoots at Serleena with his blaster and assures Laura that Jay is fine and does this all the time. As Jay struggles with the tentacles, he shouts at Laura that it's her destiny. Kay shoots at Serleena then tells Laura that if she doesn't go they will all die. He shoots at Serleena again without looking, and then tells Laura that she's just as beautiful as her mother. Laura gets into the transport pod and it closes. Kay shoots many times at Serleena and it finally retracts, releasing Jay. It rains in the transport pod as it takes her into the sky to the star. Serleena flies after Laura, a giant face visible in the front of the tentacles, so Jay and Kay take two large weapons from the car's trunk. Kay thanks Jay for bringing him back. Jay asks Kay why he didn't tell him about Laura. Kay rhetorically asks if Jay would have let her go. They shoot at Serleena, hitting her/it just before she/it reaches the transport pod. Serleena explodes over the Statue of Liberty, creating a giant fireworks display lasting several seconds. Jay asks Kay what it's like on the outside, you know, not doing this every day? Kay answers, It's nice. Sleep late on the weekends. Watch the weather channel. Kay sighs and says that he missed this city. The transport pod has disappeared into the star and the bright light fades. Jay asks Kay that if Laura is Princess Lauranna's daughter, did they...? (Jay surmises that Kay is Laura's father.) Kay ignores him and tells him that they have to go because MiB is a mess. They put the weapons back in the trunk. As they walk to the elevator, Jay asks Kay how they can go because thousands of people in New York and New Jersey just saw this event; they need a cool thought out plan. Kay puts on his sunglasses, prompting Jay to put on his. Kay presses a button on his watch, and then the torch on the Statue of Liberty buzzes and flashes: a giant neuralizer. Kay tells Jay that he'll get him trained yet. Jay gets jealous of Kay's watch.Back at MiB in the locker room, Kay sits down next to Jay, who is getting dressed. Kay tells Jay that they've all been there; the girl is gone and it hurts. He asks Jay if he wants to talk about it, because he can help. Jay replies, No. Zed sits down opposite them and thinks that Jay is still sulking, but Jay says that he's not. Zed says that Jay misses her; it happens to all of them. Zed then starts talking about how he and his girlfriend were entwined in positions from the Kama Sutra, which grosses out Jay so he makes Zed stop. Frank comes in from the shower and tells Jay about dames, about what they really want. Frank shakes off, forcing the others to stand. Frank asks Jay if he's still sitting shiva. Jay tells Frank No advice; he tells Kay No talking; he tells Zed Hell no. Jay swears that he's fine. He opens his locker; the tiny aliens are in it with their town, and they hail him; he quickly closes his locker. Kay tells Jay that he brought them over from Grand Central Terminal and put them in Jay's locker because he thought it would put things in perspective for Jay. Jay tells Kay that they need to let the aliens out of his locker so they will know that the world is a bigger place than that. Kay takes him to a black door marked: DANGER! NO EXIT. DO NOT OPEN. NOT AN EXIT! UNAUTHORIZED USE WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE REVOCATION OF ALL M.I.B. ACCESS CLEARANCES. IN CASE OF EXTREME EMERGENCY DO NOT OPEN. Kay sighs and tells Jay that he's still a rookie. Kay kicks the door open, revealing to Jay and Frank a giant room full of aliens; their door is actually a door to a locker that contains Earth, among hundreds of lockers at an alien type of Grand Central Terminal.Will Smith sings Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head) during the closing credits.Synopsis written by Mu_Ve_Watchr_89.

title: Phone Booth
synopsis: Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is an arrogant New York City publicist who is contemplating cheating on his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell). He calls Pam (Katie Holmes), a young actress, from a phone booth on a side street. When a delivery man (Dell Yount) tries to deliver a free pizza to the booth, Stu rudely dismisses him. After the phone call with Pam, the phone rings and Stu answers it. The caller (voice of Kiefer Sutherland), says that Stu should have accepted the pizza as it would have kept his strength up for what comes next. He warns Stu not to leave the booth. Stu, again dismissive, is skeptical toward the mystery caller. The caller says that he will say 'hi' to Kelly for him, then hangs up, leaving Stu visibly concerned.The unseen man calls back and reveals that he had previously setup two other dishonest individuals in a similar situation, where he gave them a chance to redeem themselves but since both refused he had to kill them. One was a pedophile, and the other was a business executive who used inside information to cash in his stock options before the company share price collapsed (and refused the caller's request to share the proceeds with regular investors who got burned on that stock). The caller tells Stu that he must tell Kelly and Pam the truth: that he is cheating. The man calls Pam, puts Stu on speakerphone, and he tells her that Stu is married and does not want anything with Pam except to sleep with her. He then tells Stu to call his wife and tell her the truth, or else he will. Angrily, Stu does so.Before he has a chance to tell Kelly the truth, Stu is distracted by three prostitutes who want to use the phone. The prostitutes become hostile due to Stu's refusal to leave the booth, and they start banging against the glass. Stu becomes agitated and finally hangs up on his wife and yells at the prostitutes to leave him alone. As the three girls leave, the man calls and warns Stu that if he hangs up again, he will shoot him. Stu does not believe him but is convinced when the man cocks his rifle. Stu gets scared, warning him that if he shoots, the cops will arrive. However, the sniper proves him to be wrong by shooting a toy robot next to the booth without anyone noticing. The caller continues to mock Stu's faith that the caller is not capable.The situation escalates further when the prostitutes and their pimp, Leon (John Enos III), approach the booth and demand that Stu leave. Terrified that he will be shot, Stu refuses. The impasse between Stu and Leon escalates to the point of Leon breaking into the booth with a bat and attacking Stu. The sniper tells Stu he can help him and Stu says yes. Leon is shot in the back by the sniper, horrifying the prostitutes, who accuse Stu.The police arrive and Stu is instantly the suspect. He doubts that they will find any evidence to suggest his guilt to the murder, but later finds out the sniper has planted a gun in the phone booth's roof, on top of the light panel that could be used as evidence in Leon's murder. Captain Ed Ramey (Forest Whitaker) arrives tries to negotiate with Stu to exit the booth but he says he cannot get off the call and he is talking to his psychiatrist. Multiple news vans arrive, and reporters begin filming the situation, putting pressure on the police to deal with the situation without appearing trigger-happy. The caller continues to taunt Stu by telling him to take hold of the planted gun, or he would Blow him (Ramey) Away! but Stu refuses, knowing the police will likely shoot him.Kelly arrives at the scene and the sniper makes Stu confess to her about his infidelity, which Stu does. The man asks Stu to choose between Pam and Kelly, threatening to kill one of them to eliminate further temptation. The unseen caller tells Stu that there are policemen right now trying to tap into the call, but will never succeed as the caller has taken precautions to avoid it.Stu pleads with the sniper while at the same time using his cell phone to call Kelly, who secretly informs Captain Ramey of the sniper's presence when Ramey hears the conversation. Stu confesses his bad character to the crowd, telling his unpaid assistant, Adam (Keith Nobbs), who looks up to Stu, not to become a publicist and admitting his $2,000 watch is a fake, like himself. Stu explains he grew up in the Bronx and he wanted to put his past behind him by buying expensive clothes. He is also not as rich as he seems.
The police finally track down the sniper by tracing the call the sniper made to Kelly, and Ramey tells Stu through a cryptic message that they have done so. Stu informs the sniper that the cops are coming to get him and the now enraged sniper chooses to take Kelly with him, seeing as she is the most important thing in his life. Panicked, Stu takes the planted gun, runs out of the booth and yells, it's me you want! Stu is shot and falls down just as police break into a hotel room, discovering a dead body, a phone, and a sniper rifle. It is then revealed that Stu had been hit by a rubber bullet from a police sniper, leaving him relatively unharmed. Kelly runs over and kisses Stu who is still on the ground. The police wheel the body they found in the hotel room down onto the street, and Kelly insists on seeing the sniper's body. Stu identifies the body as the pizza delivery man.Stu is recovering under morphine in an ambulance which makes him drowsy. A man carrying a large suitcase walks up to him, and compliments his shoes. The man says that he regrets killing the pizza deliverer and warns Stu that if his newfound honesty does not last, he will be hearing from him again. He walks away and smiles as he passes the phone booth, revealing himself to be the caller. Stu falls unconscious.The caller, now the narrator, says, Isn't it funny? You hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it? The view goes from an aerial view of the city way into space with a satellite passing by turning to black with a ring once again, and the film ends with a man answering, Hello? The murderous caller has apparently resumed his crusade to rid the world of wrongdoers.

title: Hare Ribbin'
synopsis: The short opens with a dog with a Russian accent (a la Bert Gordon's Mad Russian) hunting for a rabbit by sniffing a trail. He happens upon Bugs who begins to torment the dog. This prompts a chase, which leads to a nearby lake where the rest of the story continues. Most of the action takes place underwater.
Eventually, after a few gags, with Bugs dressed up as a mermaid, playing tag with the dog and throwing the dog into a rock, leaving his feet sticking out and Bugs disguising himself as Elmer Fudd, the dog corners Bugs and demands he gives him a rabbit sandwich. Bugs obliges, and the rabbit places himself between two giant slices of loaf bread with his legs curled next to his body. The dog takes a bite and Bugs screams and fakes his death. The dog becomes instantly grief-stricken and sobs, declaring that he should be the one to die. With this statement, Bugs springs back to life asking, Ehhhh...do you mean it?, and obliges the dog's death wish (see Alternate endings below). The dog falls to the ground, Bugs plants a flower on his chest and dances away into the distance. As the cartoon is about to iris out the dog sits up (revealing that he is still alive), holds the iris before it closes, and declares This shouldn't even happen to a dog!. He then lets the iris go, but it closes on his nose in the process, making him yelp in pain.

title: 'Breaker' Morant
synopsis: In Pretoria, South Africa, in 1902, Major Charles Bolton (Rod Mullinar) is summoned to a meeting with Lord Kitchener (Alan Cassell). He is told that three officers of the Bushveldt Carbineers—Lieutenants Harry Morant (Edward Woodward), Peter Handcock (Bryan Brown), and George Witton (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) -- have been arrested and charged with murdering captured Boers and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the Kaiser has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to India and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.
Meanwhile, Major James Francis Thomas (Jack Thompson) meets Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which don't look good. A small town solicitor from New South Wales, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Lieut. Handcock quips, Might come in handy.
As court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the Australian Army can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt.-Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the Bushveldt Carbineers. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Visser and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Furthermore, Lts. Morant and Handcock are also charged with the murder of the Reverend C.A.D. Heese.
Maj. Bolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting, and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Maj. Thomas, however, manages to damage their credibility during cross examination. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in flashback.
On 5 April 1901, Lt. Morant's close friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at Duiwelskloof intending to capture or kill Boer Commando Field Cornet Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire, and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat.
When the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain Alfred Taylor (John Waters) suggests Morant avenge Captain Hunt. After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with heavy losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a firing squad and shoot him. They obey his order.
Back in the courtroom, Maj. Thomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot all Boers captured wearing khaki. To the shock of Maj. Thomas and his clients, Maj. Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a ruse of war. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the rules of engagement justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the caliber of his rifle, Rule 303. That night, Maj. Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.
Captain Taylor testifies that, prior to his death, Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Lt. Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Col. Hubert Hamilton, decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, The gentlemen's war is over, Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies, however, that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Maj. Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners.
According to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing white flags. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. When one prisoner attacks Witton, he kills him.
In response, Maj. Thomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients only followed orders, all charges must be dropped. Lt.-Col. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the British Empire, would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Maj. Bolton privately tells Maj. Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Maj. Thomas not to insist.
In a private conversation, Kitchener tells Col. Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging total war. Now, however, he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the Afrikaner people and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers have to be sacrificed for the misdeeds of the whole British Army. He orders Col. Hamilton to testify in his place and, when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, I think you know what to do.
The following day, Col. Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and screams that the Colonel is a liar. Lt.-Col. Denny, however, comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Maj. Thomas, however, explains that Col. Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients believed that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese.
A Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Rev. Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Lt. Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him, and then ridden off, looking agitated, in the same direction as Rev. Heese. Maj. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.
Upon taking the stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Maj. Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, It was for security reasons. When Morant had confronted the Reverend, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot to death, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He smugly adds, I don't mind waiting.
After Morant stands down, Maj. Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Lt. Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Maj. Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder the most serious charge. At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts.
The following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women and slept with them. As Maj. Bolton eyes him, Maj. Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.
Later, in the prison courtyard, Lt. Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Rev. Heese. Handcock smiles and says, Me. To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his two lady friends happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Maj. Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare for a new century. As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, and even missionaries. That is why, after Rev. Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards Leydsdorp. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese, and shot him.
After a powerful summing up speech from Maj. Thomas, the defendants are found guilty of shooting the prisoners but acquitted of murdering Rev. Heese.
As they celebrate their probable evasion of the death penalty, Captain Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to Portuguese Mozambique, take ship from Lourenço Marques, and see the world. Unmoved, Morant says, I've seen it.
The next morning, all three defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to life in penal servitude. Desperate to save his clients, Maj. Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation. Upon arrival, he learns that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that both Whitehall and the Australian Government have expressed support for the verdict and sentences. Furthermore, there now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will soon be going home.
The next morning, as Lt. Morant's poem Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday is recited in voiceover, both he and Lt. Handcock are led before a firing squad. Moments before being executed, Morant shouts, Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it! The final shot shows the bodies of both men being loaded into coffins.

title: Wait Until Dark
synopsis: The film opens in a Montreal apartment during a cold wintery morning, where a woman named Lisa (Samantha Jones) waits for an old man to sew bags of heroin into the cloth body of an old-fashioned doll. As she leaves the apartment with the doll, we see the man watching her leave, then dialing someone on the phone. Lisa takes the doll with her on an airline flight to New York City, but when, on disembarking, she sees a man watching her, she becomes worried and gives the doll for safekeeping to a man she'd spoken with on the plane, professional photographer Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.). The man who'd been watching Lisa then roughly escorts her away. Later, when Lisa calls Sam to ask for the doll, Sam and his wife are unable to find it.Some time afterward, small-time con artist Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and his partner Carlino (Jack Weston) arrive at the basement apartment where Sam lives with his wife Susy (Audrey Hepburn), who is blind. The two men watch until both the apartment's occupants have left, then enter. The con men have an appointment with Lisa, who'd been their partner in crime prior to the recent imprisonment of both, but they are met instead by Harry Roat, Jr. (Alan Arkin), whom the audience recognizes as the man from a distance who watched and met Lisa at the airport. He offers them $2,000 each if they find Lisa's doll which is somewhere in the apartment.After discovering Lisa's dead body hanging in a garment bag, Talman and Carlino want to make a quick exit, but Roat points out that they have left their fingerprints all over the apartment, while he has worn gloves. Roat is then able to prevail upon the two to help him dispose of Lisa's body (he claims that he killed her because he caught her going into business for herself). Roat firmly tells Talman and Carlino help him try to find the heroin-stuffed doll.The next day, Susy's neighbor leaves for the weekend, and Sam leaves for a business trip to New Jersey. Once Susy is alone, the criminals begin an elaborate con game: In order to gain entry into the apartment, Talman arrives posing as a friend of Sam's, Carlino poses as a policeman, and Roat poses first as an old man and then as the man's son. Using first an innocuous story about Sam and the doll, then a darker one implying that Lisa has been murdered and that Sam will be suspected, the men persuade Susy to help them find the doll. Talman gives her the number for the phone booth across the street as his own after falsely warning her of a police car stationed outside.During this time, Susy has grown suspicious of Carlino and Roat, and Gloria (Julie Herrod), a girl who lives upstairs and is paid by the couple to help Susy with errands, has been going in and out of the apartment, sometimes without Susy's noticing that she is there. After Talman leaves, Gloria sneaks into the apartment carrying the doll, which she stole some time earlier. She tells Susy there is no police car outside, and Susy discovers the doll. Wanting to confirm her suspicions about Carlino and Roat, Susy tells Gloria to go home and watch the phone booth that is next to Roat's van parked outside on the street. If a man goes into it, Gloria is to phone Susy, let the phone ring twice, and hang up. Gloria tells Susy she can signal her by banging on the pipes.On Carlino's next visit, after he calls Roat at the phone booth, Gloria sends Susy the telephone signal, and she sends the signal a second time after Susy calls Talman to tell him she has the doll. Finally realizing that Talman is a criminal in cahoots with the two others, Susy hides the doll. When he walks in with Corlino and Roat following quietly, she tells him the doll is at Sam's studio. The three criminals leave after Roat cuts the telephone cord.When Susy bangs on the pipes, Gloria comes in and Susy sends her to the downtown bus station in a taxi to wait for Sam. When Susy discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by putting the criminals in the dark along with her, breaking all the light bulbs in the apartment's light fixtures. She also pours a chemical into a bowl.When Talman returns, she refuses to cooperate when he demands that she hand over the doll. Talman has spent the most time with Susy and he has come to admire her for her quiet strength and ability to stand up to the three criminals, despite her disability. He admits to her that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot and that Sam, as Susy suspected, is completely innocent of any involvement, while Roat is a particular danger. Susy needn't worry, though, Talman says, as he has sent Carlino to kill Roat.However, Roat has killed Carlino instead outside by running him over (anticipating exactly that they would turn against him). As Talman prepares to leave, pausing to say something to Susy as he stands in the doorway, Roat suddenly appears and stabs him in the back.Intent on acquiring the doll, Roat chains the door shut in the dark apartment, pours gasoline on the floor, and sets a piece of newspaper on fire. A desperate battle follows in which Susy throws the chemical solution in Roat's face and she forces him to put out the fire as well as smashes the last lightbulb in the apartment. But the battle ends when Roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. Susy, weeping (that she forgot about the refrigerator), pulls the doll out from its hiding place and hands it to him. While Roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, Susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a butcher knife.Roat then announces his intention to rape Susy, but, as he leads her to the bedroom, she manages to stab him in the belly. As she stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, (in the movie's most shocking scene) Roat suddenly leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. Screaming, Susy wrenches free, but the dying Roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. Susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. She then gropes for the refrigerator's cord, murmuring desperately, Where is it? As the reeling Roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife the refrigerator light finally goes out, and Susy's scream merges with the sound of a police siren...The scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. When the police enter with Sam and Gloria, Sam finds an unbroken light bulb and we see the room littered with the bodies of Talman and Roat, but no Susy. Finally, as Sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and Susy emerges from behind it, shaken but alive.

title: It Should Happen to You
synopsis: The script, by Garson Kanin, is about a naive young woman named Gladys Glover who yearns for fame. Strolling through Central Park, she meets a young handsome man named Pete Sheppard (Jack Lemmon). He is a maker of documentaries (apparently equipped only with a handheld 16mm camera). He is taking brief shots of people in the park. He films Gladys feeding pigeons and introduces himself.
In a rapid piece of exposition, we learn Gladys has been in New York City for two years, coming from a job at a shoe factory in Binghamton, New York. She has just lost her job as a model of girdles, because her hip size is 3/4 larger than it should be, and still has the $1000, which she saved up. Gladys is discouraged at having gotten nowhere in two years and she wants to make a name for herself. It is clear Pete is taken by Gladys. He gets her address by offering to drop her a postcard when the documentary is finished so she can see herself in it. Really? she says, I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies. You don't need to give me your right arm, says Pete, just give me your right address. Pete encourages Gladys to follow her dreams: Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a way there is a will. The two then part ways.
Wandering despondently, Gladys' attention is caught by a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle with the notice, This space for rent. Choice location. Inquire Horace Pfeiffer Co, 383 Madison Avenue. She fantasizes about her name being on the billboard and gathering up the nerve she goes to 383 Madison Avenue to inquire about the billboard. Gladys asks for Mr. Horace Puh-feiffer, pronouncing the letter P, and is corrected by the receptionist who tells her there is no Mr. Pfeiffer. Determined, Gladys obtains an interview with a busy man conducting a telephone conversation, who brusquely tells her the sign is available, demands to know whom she represents, and says I'm really too busy for this sort of thing. The spunky Gladys pulls $1000 in cash from her purse, complains that the man is too stuck up to listen to her, asks What sort of place treats people that way and starts to leave. The representative relents and tells her the sign is $210 per month, three months minimum. Gladys pays $630 in cash and arranges to have her name put on the billboard.
Within a few days the sign is up and she is thrilled. However, it turns out the Adams Soap company has traditionally booked the sign and is upset to learn that another client has obtained it. The Pfeiffer company calls Gladys to a meeting where Evan Adams III (Lawford) attempts to induce her to give up the sign by offering her more money. Gladys is not interested. She is called to another meeting and is offered six signs in exchange for the one. This time, she accepts. Now, there are six huge signs in New York, one in lights, each saying simply Gladys Glover.
Meanwhile, Pete Sheppard has taken an apartment adjacent to Gladys, a move which does not seem to rouse her curiosity, and the two become platonic friends. Sheppard is, however, exasperated by Gladys' fascination with her signs and her requests he tour the city with her to see them. Citygoers are intrigued by the mysterious signs. Gladys shops in a department store (Macy's), and when she gives her name, the word spreads quickly and dozens of people flock around to get the autograph of the famous Gladys Glover.
Soon, she is being asked to appear on television shows. However, the round of publicity begns to take an unpleasant turn. Gladys explains she obtained the signs simply in order to, Make a name for herself, but does not seem to be aware she is being treated as a figure of fun. Evan Adams III, however, decides she is ripe for exploitation as, The average American girl, and hires her to do a series of advertisements for Adams Soap. As Gladys pursues what is becoming a lucrative career, relations between her and Pete become strained. At the same time, Adams is showing an increasing interest in her. The situation reaches a crisis when Gladys breaks a date with Pete in order to attend what Adams says is a business conference to discuss a cross-country publicity tour. The conference turns out to be an attempted seduction. As Adams reaches to embrace Gladys, she accidentally or intentionally spills a full glass of champagne down the back his neck, breaking the spell. Gladys says, I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly. What I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled. Adam then says, Maybe I am. Oh, sure, if you want to make it into a sort of business proposition. That's what you're doing, isn't it? Gladys says, The way it looks to me, Mr. Adams, is that there are two sorts of people. The people who will do anything to make a name for themselves, and the people who will do almost anything. Soon there will be signs all over saying I'm the average American girl. That was your idea wasn't it? Well, I don't think the average American girl should do... this then Gladys walks out.
When she arrives home she finds a 16 mm movie projector in her room with a note from Pete telling her to run it. A film plays complete with titles and synchronized sound, entitled Goodby, [sic] Gladys. The charmingly self-deprecating Pete confesses he loves Gladys, acknowledges that his profile is not as good looking as Adams', and says goodbye.
Gladys' advertising career continues, but she finds its emptiness more and more frustrating. She recalls Pete's frequent questions as to why she wants to be above the crowd instead of being happy being part of the crowd.
In the meantime, Pete continues to make a go of his documentary film career. In a cage at a zoo, he makes a documentary showing how the visitors appear to the animals. He coaches the crowd to react to him as if he was a chimpanzee and he jumps around in the cage, filming the crowd, as they throw him peanuts. Suddenly, the crowd's attention is distracted by the sound of an airplane. Puzzled, Pete looks up and sees the plane has skywritten the message, PETE CALL GLADYS PLEASE. He grins, the film cuts to Gladys and Pete driving in a car and discussing plans for the future. Gladys spots an empty billboard with a message, THIS SPACE FOR RENT. Apply Acme Realty Co. Gladys looks to be pondering the possibilities; seeing this a concerned Pete says What are you looking at! Gladys quickly reflects all her troubles that started with her name placed on signs and as she lovingly embraces Pete responds, Nothing, absolutely nothing!

title: The Medium
synopsis: === Act 1 ===
The medium's parlor
Monica, Madame Flora's daughter, and Toby, a mute servant boy rescued from the streets of Budapest play dress-up. When Madame Flora, or Baba as they call her, arrives home drunk, she violently chastises them for not preparing for that night's seance. Soon the guests arrive, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau, regulars, and the widow Mrs. Nolan who is attending for the first time. With Madame Flora in a trance in her chair, a fake seance is held where Mrs. Nolan speaks with what she thinks is her deceased sixteen-year-old daughter but is really Monica behind a screen. As Monica disappears, Mrs. Nolan rushes toward the figure and is restrained by the Gobineaus. When order is restored, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau communicate with their deceased two-year-old son Mickey who does nothing but laugh. After they say goodbye to him, Madame Flora suddenly, with a loud gasp... clutches at her throat with both hands. She feels a phantom hand clutching her throat and is terror-stricken. After demanding that the guests leave, she calls for Monica and tells her what she felt, eventually blaming Toby who was in the other room the whole time. In an effort to calm Baba's drunken rage toward Toby, Monica sings her the dark lullaby The Black Swan which is interrupted by a voice that Baba hears causing her to fly into a terrified rage at Toby for not telling her where the voice is coming from. The act ends with Monica again singing the lullaby while Baba recites her Hail Marys.
=== Act 2 ===
A few days later
Toby is giving a puppet show for Monica. Their mutual love becomes more obvious. When Baba comes home, she resumes her accusations on Toby, sure that he knows what went on that night. The guests again arrive, expecting another seance but are driven away by Madame Flora who tries to convince them that the whole thing was a sham by revealing all the tricks that she and Monica used. But the guests are not convinced and leave claiming that while she might have thought she was cheating them, she in fact was not. Once the guests are gone, she drives Toby out despite Monica's pleas on his behalf. With everyone gone, and Monica in her room, Baba pours herself another drink and questions her own sanity, becoming wild with drink and eventually passing out. Once she has fallen asleep, Toby sneaks back in and tries to get into Monica's room, but finds it locked and eventually goes to the trunk to find his tambourine. While searching, he knocks the lid of the trunk down waking Baba. Toby quickly hides in the puppet theater. As Baba tries to see where the noise came from and fetches a revolver from a drawer in the table. Hysterically she shouts out Who is it? Speak or I'll Shoot! and the puppet theater curtain moves.  Baba screams and fires at it several times. As Toby's bloody body collapses grasping the curtain, Baba says I've killed the ghost! I've killed the ghost! Monica, hearing the gunshots, enters, sees Toby's lifeless body and runs for help. As the final curtain falls very slowly Baba asks, in a hoarse whisper, Was it you?

title: What's Cookin' Doc?
synopsis: The plot centers on the Academy Awards presentation. The action begins with actual color film footage of various Hollywood scenes (edited from A Star Is Born), narrated by Robert C. Bruce. It leads up to the Big Question of the evening: Who will win the Oscar? The film shows the stereotypical red carpet arrivals of stars, as well as a human emcee starting to introduce the Oscar show.
At this point the film switches to animation, with the shadow of a now-animated emcee (and now voiced by Mel Blanc) continuing to introduce the Oscar, and Bugs (also Mel Blanc's voice, as usual) assuring the viewer that it's in da bag; I'm a cinch to win. Bugs is stunned when the award goes instead to James Cagney (who had actually won in the previous year's ceremony, for Warner's Yankee Doodle Dandy). Shock turns to anger as Bugs declares the results to be sa-bo-TAH-gee and demands a recount.
Bugs then tries to make his case by showing clips from Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt (which includes clip of Hiawatha attempting to cook the rabbit) as proof of his allegedly superior acting (an inside joke, as the cartoon had actually been nominated for an Oscar and lost). He hurls a set of film cans off-screen and tells someone named Smokey to roll 'em! Bugs tells the audience that these are some of his best scenes. Immediately a stag reel (with the title card depicting a grinning stag) starts to roll, and the startled Bugs quickly stops it and switches to the right film.
Finally, he pleads with the audience, What do you say, folks? Do I get it? Or do I get it? (echoing Fredric March's drunken appeal to the Academy Award banquet audience in A Star Is Born). The emcee asks the audience (in an affected nasal voice), Shall we give it to him, folks? and they yell, Yeah, let's give it to him! whereupon they shower Bugs with fruits and vegetables (enabling him to briefly do a Carmen Miranda impression)... and an ersatz Oscar labeled booby prize, which is actually a gold-plated rabbit statue. Bugs is so pleased at winning it, he remarks, I'll even take youse to bed wit' me every night! The statue suddenly comes alive, asks in a voice like that of radio character, Bert Gordon, Do you mean it?, smooches the startled bunny, and takes on an effeminate, hip-swiveling pose. The screen fades out, Clampett's famous vocalized Bay-woop! is heard, and the That's all, Folks! card appears.

title: The Two Mouseketeers
synopsis: Jerry and Nibbles are two mouseketeers who decide to help themselves to a lavish royal banquet. Tom has been ordered to guard the spread from the King's Mouseketeers with his life, under threat of execution by beheading from the guillotine. Jerry and Nibbles enter the castle hall through a stained-glass window. Jerry releases the rear-end cover on a suit of armor, making a small drawbridge to the windowsill; they sneak into the armor, emerge from the helmet's faceguard, and then parachute onto the table. They unwittingly catch Tom's attention by showering him with champagne.
After hiding from Tom by wearing white paper decorations from the standing rib roast to look like two ribs, Jerry runs off, but the little mouseketeer Nibbles begins making a ham sandwich while singing Alouette to himself. Tom emerges behind him and pokes him with his sword, and Nibbles yells in protest. The little angry mouse says He, attention-la! Vous pourez faire mal a quelqu'un, Monsieur Pussycat!...Pussycat?! Au secours! Au secours! Le pussycat! Le pussycat! (Hey! Watch it! You could hurt someone like that, Mister Pussycat. Pussy Cat!? Help! Help! The pussycat! The pussycat!). But before he can get away, Tom captures him by putting his rapier through Nibbles' cape. Jerry manages to stab Tom in the rear-end to rescue Nibbles, and throws a custard in Tom's face for good measure. This launches a swashbuckling fencing display against Tom, ending in Tom catching Jerry. Nibbles tips a long-handled axe toward Tom and it shaves the tabard and all the fur off Tom's back from head to hind end, (and revealing ruffled white underwear), while Nibbles hides in some fruit.
Nibbles runs away, but is sent flying by Tom into a full wine glass – but Jerry saves him by hurling a tomato at Tom, followed by multiple vegetables. After impaling each of the vegetables on his rapier, Tom then heats and eats them like a shish kebab. Nibbles climbs out of the glass, now drunk. He pokes Tom in the rear-end, making him yowl and jump up, as Nibbles waves his sword, saying, Touché, pussycat! But as he runs away, Tom catches him. Jerry makes the save by hitting Tom on the head with a mace so hard that Tom falls through the table, which leads into Tom and Jerry resuming their sword fighting. While this goes on, Nibbles brings along a cannon and stuffs it with everything on the banquet table. He lights the cannon and it violently explodes.
As the smoke disappears, Jerry and Nibbles are seen walking triumphantly down the street with stolen banquet food. Suddenly, they see in the distance a guillotine, and with a drumroll the blade comes down, strongly suggesting that Tom was executed (although off-screen in order to comply with the Hays Code). Both mice gulp, and then Nibbles sighs Pauvre, pauvre pussycat! (Poor, poor pussycat!). Then he shrugs, saying C'est la guerre! (Such is war!). With that, the two Mouseketeers continue their victory march off into the night.

title: Play It Again, Sam
synopsis: Set in San Francisco, the film begins with the closing scenes of Casablanca, with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. We then see that the main character, Allan Felix (Woody Allen), is watching the film in a cinema, mouth agape. He leaves the cinema regretting that he will never be like Rick.
Apart from apparitions of Bogart he also has frequent flashbacks of conversations with his ex-wife, who constantly mocked his sexual inadequacy.
Allan Felix has just been through a messy divorce. His best friend, Dick Christie (Tony Roberts), and Dick's wife, Linda (Diane Keaton), try to convince him to go out with women again, setting him up on a series of blind dates, all of which turn out badly. Throughout the film, he is seen receiving dating advice from the ghost of Humphrey Bogart (played by Jerry Lacy), who is visible and audible only to Allan. Allan's ex-wife Nancy (Susan Anspach) also makes fantasy appearances, as he imagines conversations with her about the breakdown of their marriage. On one occasion, the fantasy seems to run out of control, with both Bogart and Nancy appearing.
When it comes to women, he attempts to become sexy and sophisticated, in particular he tries to be like his idol, Bogart, only to end up ruining his chances by being too clumsy. Eventually, he develops feelings for Linda, around whom he feels relatively at ease and does not feel the need to put on the mask.
At the point where he finally makes his move on Linda (aided by comments from Bogart) a vision of his ex-wife appears and shoots Bogart, leaving him without advice. He then makes an awkward move. Linda runs off but returns, realizing that Allan loves her. The song As Time Goes By plays as they kiss, with flashes from Casablanca.
However, their relationship is doomed, just as it was for Rick and Ilsa in Casablanca.
Dick comes home early from Cleveland and confides to Allan that he thinks Linda is having an affair, not realizing that her affair is with Allan. Dick expresses to Allan his love for Linda.
The ending is an allusion to Casablanca's famous ending. Dick is catching a flight to Cleveland, Linda is after him, and Allan is chasing Linda. The fog, the aircraft engine start-ups, the trenchcoats, and the dialogue are all reminiscent of the film, as Allan nobly explains to Linda why she has to go with her husband, rather than stay behind with him.
Allan quotes a closing line from Casablanca, saying, If that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life. That is beautiful, Linda says, causing Allan to admit, It's from Casablanca. ... I've waited my whole life to say it! His journey is complete. The music from the scene in Casablanca resumes the theme As Time Goes By, and the film ends.

title: First Men in the Moon
synopsis: The narrator is a London businessman who withdraws to the countryside to write a play, by which he hopes to alleviate his financial problems. Bedford rents a small countryside house in Lympne, in Kent, where he wants to work in peace. He is bothered every afternoon, however, at precisely the same time, by a passer-by making odd noises. After two weeks Bedford accosts the man, who proves to be a reclusive physicist named Mr. Cavor. Bedford befriends Cavor when he learns he is developing a new material, cavorite, which can negate the force of gravity.
When a sheet of cavorite is prematurely processed, it makes the air above it weightless and shoots off into space. Bedford sees in the commercial production of cavorite a possible source of wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we fancied; we might own and order the whole world. Cavor hits upon the idea of a spherical spaceship made of steel, lined with glass, and with sliding windows or blinds made of cavorite by which it can be steered, and persuades a reluctant Bedford to undertake a voyage to the moon; Cavor is certain there is no life there.
On the way to the moon, they experience weightlessness, which Bedford finds exceedingly restful. On the surface of the moon the two men discover a desolate landscape, but as the sun rises, the thin, frozen atmosphere vaporizes and strange plants begin to grow with extraordinary rapidity. Bedford and Cavor leave the capsule, but in romping about get lost in the rapidly growing jungle. They hear for the first time a mysterious booming coming from beneath their feet. They encounter great beasts, monsters of mere fatness, that they dub mooncalves, and five-foot-high Selenites tending them. At first they hide and crawl about, but growing hungry partake of some monstrous coralline growths of fungus that inebriate them. They wander drunkenly until they encounter a party of six extraterrestrials, who capture them. The insectoid lunar natives (referred to as Selenites, after Selene, the moon goddess) are part of a complex and technologically sophisticated society that lives underground, but this is revealed only in radio communications received from Cavor after Bedford's return to earth.
Bedford and Cavor break out of captivity beneath the surface of the moon and flee, killing several Selenites. In their flight they discover that gold is common on the moon. In their attempt to find their way back to the surface and to their sphere, they come upon some Selenites carving up mooncalves but fight their way past. Back on the surface, they split up to search for their spaceship. Bedford finds it but returns to Earth without Cavor, who injured himself in a fall and was recaptured by the Selenites, as Bedford learns from a hastily scribbled note he left behind.
Chapter 19, Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space, plays no role in the plot but is a remarkable set piece in which the narrator describes experiencing a quasi-mystical pervading doubt of my own identity. . . the doubts within me could still argue: 'It is not you that is reading, it is Bedford—but you are not Bedford, you know. That's just where the mistake comes in.' 'Counfound it!' I cried, 'and if I am not Bedford, what am I? But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions like shadow seem from far away... Do you know I had an idea that really I was something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and out of space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole through which I looked at life...
By good fortune, the narrator lands in the sea off the coast of Britain, near the seaside town of Littlestone, not far from his point of departure. His fortune is made by some gold he brings back, but he loses the sphere when a curious boy named Tommy Simmons climbs into the unattended sphere and shoots off into space. Bedford writes and publishes his story in The Strand Magazine, then learns that Mr. Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has been experimenting with certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America, has picked up fragments of radio communications from Cavor sent from inside the moon. During a period of relative freedom Cavor has taught two Selenites English and learned much about lunar society.
Cavor's account explains that Selenites exist in thousands of forms and find fulfillment in carrying out the specific social function for which they have been brought up: specialization is the essence of Selenite society. With knowledge the Selenites grew and changed; mankind stored their knowledge about them and remained brutes—equipped, remarks the Grand Lunar, when he finally meets Cavor and hears about life on Earth. Unfortunately, Cavor reveals humanity's propensity for war; the lunar leader and those listening to the interview are stricken with amazement. Bedford infers that it is for this reason that Cavor has been prevented from further broadcasting to Earth. Cavor's transmissions are cut off as he is trying to describe how to make cavorite. His final fate is unknown, but Bedford is sure that we shall never… receive another message from the moon.

title: Case of the Missing Hare
synopsis: A bald-haired magician named Ala Bahma is nailing self-promoting posters on every conceivable surface, including a tree in which Bugs is living. Bugs protests having his home encroached and his right to private property compromised, until the magician apologizes and offers Bugs a blackberry pie. The rabbit's expression momentarily changes to joy as Ala Bahma magically brandishes a blackberry pie from underneath his cloth, then suddenly splatters the pie in Bugs's face. As the magician walks away laughing, What a dumb bunny!, an enraged Bugs decides that it is time for revenge and says his famous line: Of course you realize, this means war!
Bugs exacts his revenge through a series of public humiliations at the Bijou theater, where Ala Bahma is performing. First, Bugs replaces himself with a carrot during Ala Bahma's hat-trick and gets into his outfit. Despite Ala Bahma's objections, Bugs claims he will to help the magician. He goes into his hat and repeats Ala Bahma's hat trick and accepts brief applause. Bugs gets into Ala Bahma's hat, kisses the magician and ties up his mustache. When Ala Bahma unties his mustache, he sees a sign posted by Bugs to tempt him with a carrot. Next, Bugs grabs Ala Bahma's mallet and hits him as he grabs the carrot and eats it. Ala Bahma puts his hand in the hat, only for Bugs to pull the magician in. As Bugs emerges, however, Ala Bahma grabs him and after they fight off-screen, the magician barricades his own hat with wood planks and nails to make sure that Bugs does not get out.
Later, Ala Bahma does an Indian Basket Trick performance with Bugs posing as a volunteer. During his trick, he puts the knives in the basket. When Ala Bahma discovers that Bugs has snuck out from behind him while feigning pain, Bugs runs and attempts to jump into his hat but hits it on the barricade. Ala Bahma charges at Bugs to kill him, but Bugs plays a statues game on the magician. Once Ala Bahma gets close enough, Bugs dresses up as a fencer for Ala Bahma to fight him. Bugs escapes to the balcony to heckle Ala Bahma. Realizing that he has been tricked again, Ala Bahma uses a shotgun and fires at Bugs. However, Bugs appears from Ala Bahma's hat and places a cigar in his mouth, which promptly explodes. After kissing Ala Bahma, Bugs brandishes his own blackberry pie. He says to the audience, quoting Red Skelton's Mean Widdle Kid, If I dood it, I get a whippin'...I DOOD IT! and splatters the pie in Ala Bahma's face. Bugs ends his performance with Aloha 'Oe on a ukulele as he descends into the hat.

title: The Big Snooze
synopsis: In this cartoon-within-a-cartoon, Bugs and Elmer are in the midst of their usual hunting-chasing scenario. After Bugs tricks Elmer into running through a hollow log and off a cliff three times (a comic triple of sorts originally used in Avery's All this and Rabbit Stew. In fact, the same animation sequence was recycled for The Big Snooze, with the stereotypical black hunter being redrawn into Elmer Fudd), Elmer becomes enraged and frustrated that the writers never let him catch the rabbit in the pictures they both appear in. He tears up his Warner Bros. cartoon contract and walks off the set to devote his life to fishing, stunning Bugs, who piteously protests and effortlessly tries to ask him to reconsider. During a relaxing fishing trip, Elmer falls asleep.
Bugs observes Elmer's nap and takes sleeping pills in order to rock Elmer's dreamboat (Bugs sang Beautiful Dreamer, by invading his dream and continuing to drive Elmer crazy when Bugs uses the Nightmare Paint. Symbolic of his dreamland plight, Elmer appears nearly nude, wearing only his derby hat and a strategically placed loincloth consisting of a laurel wreath. Elmer's dream is invaded by ziwwions and twiwwions of wabbits dancing on his head and singing The rabbits are coming. Hooray! Hooray! in a parody of the Pink Elephants on Parade sequence from the 1941 Disney film Dumbo with Bugs Bunny literally multiplying them from an adding machine. Looking for another way to torment Elmer, Bugs consults the book A Thousand and One Arabian Nightmares, exclaiming, Oh, no! It's too gruesome! before peeking over the book to cheerfully tell the audience, But I'll do it! Elmer realizes what Bugs has in mind, pleading No, no! No, not that! Not that, pwease! as Bugs ties him to railroad tracks, just as the Superchief (Bugs in an Indian chief's headdress, leading a conga line of baby rabbits) crosses over Elmer's head.
Elmer's anger at a failed pursuit through the surreal landscape, down connected rabbit holes, is promptly used against him by Bugs who inquires What's the matter doc, ya cold? Here, I'll fix dat. Before Elmer can protest, Bugs dresses him like a woman by wrapping his body with green material from the right, slapping a wig on him, and applying lipstick. Bugs inspects his handiwork, then lifts the backdrop to reveal a trio of literal wolves, lounging by the sign at Hollywood and Vine. When the trio notice Elmer, one wolf hollers Hooooow old is she?!, right before another wolf begins flirting with Elmer. Bugs enjoys watching the male wolves hit on Elmer, who yells Gwacious! before he grabs the hem of his gown and flees from the wolves, who give chase, briefly stopping to ask the audience Have any of you giwls evew had an expewience wike this?.
In an attempt to help, Bugs persuades Elmer to follow a mad dash towards stage right, as Bugs plays the old gag run 'this way'!, putting Elmer through a bizarre series of steps which include running on his feet, flipping upside down to run on his hair, hopping like a frog, as well as Russian folk dancing.
As Bugs and Elmer dive off a cliff, Bugs drinks some Hare Tonic (Stops Falling Hare) and screeches to a halt in mid-air, while the dream Elmer continues to careen toward earth, finally crash-landing into the real Elmer's snoozing body as he wakes up with a start, exclaiming Ooh, what a howwible nightmare!.
Elmer dashes back to the cartoon's original set, pieces his Warner contract back together, and agrees to finish what he started. The chase through the log begins anew. Bugs faces the audience in a closeup, closing with the catchphrase from the Beulah character on the radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, Ah love dat man!

title: The Sheltering Sky
synopsis: Three Americans from New York arrive in Tangier in 1947. Port Moresby (John Malkovich) and his wife Kit (Debra Winger) are accompanied by their friend George Tunner (Campbell Scott) on a trip that will take them deep into the Sahara Desert. Tunner observes We're probably the first tourists they've had since the war, to which Kit replies We're not tourists. We're travelers. While Tunner plans to return home in a few weeks, Port and Kit plan on staying for a year or two.
While awaiting transport to a hotel, the group meets a pair of English travelers, the Lyles – Mrs. Lyle (Jill Bennett), a travel writer, and her adult son Eric (Timothy Spall). Eric's mother keeps him constantly short of money so he is always asking for credit and loans. After arriving at the hotel, they sit in the hotel bar and are observed by an older man sitting alone at a table. This character is played by the story's author, Paul Bowles. The man narrates to himself an extract from the novel on which the film is based,
“Because neither Kit nor Port had ever lived a life of any kind of regularity, they had both made the fatal error of coming hazily to regard time as non-existent. One year was like another year. Eventually everything would happen.”
Port invites Kit to accompany him for a walk in the city. After she refuses and rebuffs his romantic advances, Port angrily leaves. During his walk he meets a pimp who introduces him to a prostitute (Amina Annabi) in a berber encampment. The two have sex and the prostitute attempts to steal his wallet. Port quickly leaves and is chased by a mob from the camp.
The next morning Tunner arrives at Kit's room to take her shopping. Not wanting Tunner to know that Port stayed out all night, she removes the covers from his bed to make it appear that he slept there. As Kit and Tunner are preparing to leave, a disheveled Port arrives. Seeing his bed, he assumes that Tunner spent the night with Kit.
Port and Kit once again encounter the Lyles and are offered a ride in their car to Boussif, their next destination, but are informed that there is no room for Tunner. Port accepts the ride with the Lyles while Kit takes the train with Tunner. Tunner and Kit drink champagne throughout the journey and awake the next morning, naked, in Kit's hotel room after a drunken tryst.
Suspicious of Kit's relationship with Tunner, Port arranges for Eric Lyle to provide Tunner with transportation to Messad on the pretext that Port and Kit will meet him later. Eric agrees but also steals Port's passport.
In Bounoura, Port discovers his passport missing. Even after being informed by local officials that the passport can be recovered in Messad, Port decides to proceed by bus to El Ga'a with Kit in order to avoid a meeting with Tunner. On the journey Port contracts typhoid. The hotel won't accommodate them from fear of infection. Kit transports the delirious Port to a French foreign legion post, but it has no doctor and she nurses him herself, becoming increasingly desperate at his condition. He eventually dies alongside her in their room. Kit leaves the body and sets off alone into the Sahara.
Kit wanders in the desert until she begs a ride from a camel caravan led by Belqassim (Eric Vu-An). After the caravan arrives at Belqassim's home far to the south in Niger, he disguises Kit as a boy and locks her in a guest house. Although held captive, Kit welcomes Belqassim's advances and the two begin an affair. Kit is soon discovered by Belqassim's wives, who order her to leave. Kit finds herself disoriented in the local marketplace and is set upon by a mob. She is eventually found, mute and almost insane, in a Catholic mission hospital by staff of the American embassy, who have been prompted to search for her by Tunner, who has found Port's grave. She is transported back to Tangier, where she began her journey, and is told that Tunner is waiting for her there. After arriving at the hotel, Kit flees into the city before Tunner can meet her.
The film ends with a quote from the novel spoken by Paul Bowles, the narrator, still sitting in the hotel bar,
“Death is always on the way, but the fact that you don't know when it will arrive seems to take away from the finiteness of life. It's that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.”

title: Human Highway
synopsis: Employees and customers spend time at a small gas station-diner in a fictional town next to a nuclear power plant unaware it is the last day on Earth. Young Otto (Dean Stockwell) has received ownership of the failing business by the Will of his recently deceased father. His employee, Lionel Switch (Neil Young), is the garage's goofy and bumbling auto mechanic who dreams of being a rock star. I can do it! Lionel often exclaims. After some modest character development and a collage-like dream sequence there is a tongue-in-cheek choreographed musical finale while nuclear war begins.
At the destroyed gas station-diner post nuclear holocaust Booji Boy (Mark Mothersbaugh) is a lone survivor, but after his cynical prose the opening credits are a return to present time prior to apocalypse. [Some edits of the film place this scene at the end, including the most recent Director's Cut.]
At the nuclear power plant nuclear garbage persons (members of Devo) reveal that radioactive waste is routinely mishandled and dumped at the nearby town of Linear Valley. They sing a remake of Worried Man Blues while loading waste barrels on an old truck. Meanwhile, Lionel and his buddy Fred Kelly (Russ Tamblyn) ride bicycles to work. Fred states that Old Otto's recent death was by radiation poisoning. They remain unaware of the implications as Lionel laments it should have been himself that died because he has worked on almost every radiator in every car in town.
Early in the day at the diner Young Otto announces he must fire an employee for lack of money. He chooses waitress Kathryn (Sally Kirkland) who has a tantrum and refuses to leave. She sits down weeping at a booth that has a picture on the wall of Old Otto (also Stockwell) and chooses on the juke box the song The End of the World. Later, waitress Irene (Geraldine Baron) overhears Young Otto's plans to fire everybody, destroy the buildings and collect on a fraud insurance claim. Irene demands to be included in the scheme and to seal the deal with a kiss.
Although Lionel has a crush on the waitress Charlotte (Charlotte Stewart), she has a crush on the milkman Earl Duke (David Blue). After an earthquake Duke, dressed in white, enters the diner with a delivery. He flirts with her saying, Charlotte ...on my way over here this morning I thought about you and the earth moved. She replies, You felt it too! He also offers her a milk bath. While he is there a dining Arab sheik offers him wealth in return for his whiteness.
A limousine stops at the gas station. After Lionel learns his rock star idol, Frankie Fontaine (also Young), is in the limousine he insists the vehicle will need work. After meeting rock star Frankie, who appears to lead an opulent, sequestered and drug influenced life-style, Lionel says to the wooden Indian in his shop, Now there's a real human being!
Lionel receives a bump on the head while working on Frankie's limousine and enters a dream. He becomes a rock star with a back up band of wooden Indians. Back stage he is given a milk bath by Irene. Lionel travels with his band (the wooden Indians) and crew (all people from his waking life) by trucks through the desert. The wooden Indians become missing.
During Goin' Back (a song by Young) the entourage recreates in the desert near a Pueblo. Native Americans prepare a bonfire to burn the wooden Indians which had been missing. Soon Lionel is playing music and dancing around the bonfire which appears to have become the center of a Pow-wow. Goin' Back ends gazing into the bonfire of burning wooden Indians. Hey, Hey, My, My is a ten-minute studio jam performance of Devo and Young.
Lionel wakes from his dream surrounded by concerned friends much like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Soon there is the start of global nuclear war. No one is sure what is happening until it is announced by Booji Boy, as the hour of sleep. He then provides shovels and commands everyone to dig that hole and dance like a mole! The cast then enters a choreographed adaptation of Worried Man. The planet is engulfed in radioactive glow and the cast, still festive, climbs a stairway to heaven accompanied by harp music.

title: Number Seventeen
synopsis: Detective Barton is searching for a necklace stolen by a gang of thieves. In the beginning, the gang is in a house in London, before going on the run.
The film starts off with Detective Barton (John Stuart) arriving at a house marked for sale or rent. The door is unlocked and he wanders in. An unknown person with a candle is wandering about and a dead body is found. When confronted the mysterious person claims innocence of the murdered person. Barton (who introduces himself as Forsythe) asks the stranger what he has in his pockets (handkerchief, string, sausage, picture of a child, half a cigarette), before the shadow of a hand is shown reaching for a doorknob. The stranger (who later introduces himself as Ben) searches the body of the dead person and finds handcuffs and a gun which he takes.
The detective returns from investigating the weird sound and finds the handcuffs which the stranger left on the ground. A person is seen to be crawling on the roof through shadows, who then falls through the roof. This is a woman called Miss Ackroyd (Ann Casson) who is revived and cries out for her father. She explains that her father went onto the roof and that they are next door in number 15.
The bell tolls half past midnight and the dead body has disappeared. Three people arrive at the windswept house, Mr. Ackroyd (Henry Caine), Nora (Anne Grey) (who is deaf and dumb) and a third person. Ben draws out the gun. Ben accidentally shoots the governor. Mr. Ackroyd draws out a gun and asks him to search the gentlemen, Ben and Miss Ackroyd. The telegram is revealed to Mr. Ackroyd. Sheldrake (Garry Marsh) gets the diamond necklace, which he has hidden in the upper portion of a toilet. Ben causes a commotion and is locked away with Sheldrake.
The two hands of Sheldrake reach out and appear to strangle Ben who is only pretending to be knocked out. More members of the gang arrive. They suggest tying up Miss Ackroyd and 'Forsythe'. The three thieves all have to catch a train. However, one of the thieves is Miss Ackroyd's father—a police officer—who locks away two of the thieves and frees Miss Ackroyd and Doyle. He opens the door where Ben is locked away with Sheldrake and gets into a fist fight with Sheldrake.
The other man reveals himself as Sheldrake (the supposed 'corpse' from earlier) and frees the others. Miss Ackroyd and 'Forsythe' are tied up again. Nora reveals herself to be able to speak and says I'm coming back. She comes back and frees Miss Ackroyd and Doyle. Miss Ackroyd faints but recovers. Nora returns to the basement to allay the suspicions of the other thieves and buy time for the rest to get away. They free Ben and Miss Ackroyd's father. The thieves arrive at the train yard, and board a freight train that is departing. The train says Deutsch-Englischer Fahrverkehr Ferry Service between Germany-Great Britain.
The train departs with Ben aboard and he stumbles onto crates of wine. The thieves, after dispatching the conductor, go to the front of the train, shoot the fireman, and catch the Driver as he faints. 'Forsythe' failed to get on the train before it departed and commandeers a bus. Ben is revealed to have the necklace. Sheldrake discovers he doesn't have the diamond and the thieves fight each other. Sheldrake claims that 'Barton' a detective posing as a thief. A chase scene occurs on the train as the thieves go after Barton. Barton escapes and handcuffs Nora. The bus that 'Forsythe' is on races after the train. The thieves, realising the train is accelerating, try to find the brakes. They turn dials helplessly and notice the bus that 'Forsythe' is on.
Pushing levers and turning dials does nothing, indeed, it only makes the train go faster, leaving the thieves unable to escape. At the dock, the ferry pulls up. As 'Forsythe' watches, the train hurtles through the dock, crashes into the train currently on the ferry at full speed, and pushes it out to sea, dragging the remaining cars into the ocean. People are rescued from the water. Henry Doyle tells Forsythe that he is posing as Detective Barton. But Forsythe is actually Detective Barton, who says to Doyle, You can't be Barton because I am. All of the thieves are apprehended by the police who are on the scene. Nora asks Barton, What are you going to do about it? Barton replied You better come along with me. Nora says Where? To breakfast. Barton says, and they laugh. Ben then reveals he has the diamond necklace.

title: The Haunting
synopsis: The film opens with narration over a silhouette of Hill House at night. The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone. Title and credits follow, then narration continues, Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted... The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton).Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find. Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson's lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House? Markway replies, Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name).Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor's plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, I think you should have a vacation, Nell. Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive.Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. What do you want? he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her.The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won't stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora's sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, The house, it's alive. Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell.Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old. Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo's ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway. Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, Help Eleanor Come Home. Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother's sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake.Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... like sisters. That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won't register on any thermometer. Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, Theo, you're breaking my hand. The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won't allow that to happen. She yells, Stop It! Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, Whose hand was I holding?The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone's nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an unnatural thing as well as a nature's mistake.At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John's wife, arrives. She informs her husband, A reporter's been telephoning all day. He's on your track. He's heard about you renting this place. Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, to join the ghost hunt. When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is. Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, You insult my intelligence. You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me. Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone's warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife.Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell's car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree.The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, I didn't want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John. She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor's accident, Luke takes a different view. Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree. Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that we who walk here... walk alone. The end title comes up as well as the final title card 'The Haunting' followed by eerie piano music.

title: Psycho II
synopsis: Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after being pronounced of sound mind by his psychiatrist, Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia) after 22 years. At the hearing preceding Norman's release, Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) shows up to protest, producing a petition that she's been circulating with signatures of 743 people who do not want to see Norman return to society. Lila is the sister of Marion Crane, one of Norman's victims (from the first film), and the widow of Sam Loomis, who was Marion's boyfriend at the time of her death. When the judge refuses to acknowledge Lila's petition, she vows to see Norman returned to the institution to pay for his crimes.Dr. Raymond takes Norman back to his old home, the gloomy mansion on the hill behind the Bates Motel. A car is parked by the motel, which belongs to Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz)--the current owner of the motel. Dr. Raymond offers to introduce Norman to him, but Norman says it can wait until later. Walking up the steps to the house, Norman thinks he sees someone in his mother's bedroom window. Dr. Raymond says there hasn't been a tenant in the house for years. Norman admits he is just nervous about being back after such a long time away.Inside the house, all the furniture is covered up with sheets. Dr. Raymond asks Norman if he wants to stay somewhere else, but Norman insists on being back at home. Dr. Raymond reminds Norman that, with him living back at home, the memories from his past are likely to reoccur, but he is confident that Norman can handle it now. Dr. Raymond regrets that there won't be a trained social worker to check in on Norman occasionally, due to budget cutbacks, however Norman says that at least Dr. Raymond will come by from time to time to see him. Dr. Raymond informs Norman that the telephone has been reconnected, and that he is to report to work at noon for a pre-arranged job as a short-order cook and dishwasher at a diner down the road from the motel.After Dr. Raymond leaves, Norman takes his suitcase upstairs, and picks up the phone receiver and hears the dial tone. He sees a piece of paper under the phone, and picks it up. It is a note from Mother. It says, Norman, I'll be home late. Fix your own dinner. Love, M. Suddenly, Norman is startled when he hears Mother's voice calling to him from her room. Norman then has a memory from his childhood. He sees his adolescent self reflected on the doorknob. Mother says, Norman! What did you put in my tea? (sounds of a glass breaking) I'm gonna get you for this, Norman. I'll show you what happens to bad little boys who poison their mothers--I'm gonna kill you! Her door slowly opens, and then a hand falls to the floor, writhes for a few seconds, and then lays still. Her door slams shut and Norman lets go of his suitcase, which tumbles down the stairs, his clothes spilling out.Norman arrives at the diner, and introduces himself to a kindly old woman named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar) who works as a hostess, waitress and cashier. She takes him back to the kitchen to meet Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne), the owner and short-order cook. Norman's other co-workers include a grouchy waitress named Myrna (Lee Garlington), and Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress who is less than stellar at her job, only having worked there for the past four days. Emma Spool gets Norman an apron and tells him to take the meal orders while dishwashing and helping Ralph around the stove. When Mary accidentally knocks a pie plate off a table, sending a piece of pie and a large knife to the floor. Ralph angrily asks her what happened. Norman covers for Mary and says that he did it. Ralph lets Norman off the hook and gets him started with some duties, including reading off orders that the waitresses bring back.Later that night, Norman leaves the diner and starts to head back home, when he hears Mary shouting on a payphone, arguing with her boyfriend. She hangs up the phone, and when Norman asks what happened, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a temporary place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel for free. They start walking just as a thunderstorm is forming in the sky. They get back to the motel just as the rain starts pouring down. Norman goes into the office and reaches for the key to cabin #1, but he grabs a different key instead. He tells her to wait there while he checks the bed linen in the cabin. Then, Warren Toomey enters, startling Mary. He asks her if she wants to rent a room, but she says that Norman is taking care of it. Norman comes back, and tells Mary to go up to the house and wait for him. She leaves, and Norman puts a handful of drug paraphernalia down on the desk and questions Warren about it. Norman discovers the motel is now a sleazy hookup location run by the equally sleazy Mr. Toomey. Norman fires Toomey and tells him to be gone by the next night.Back in the house, Norman makes a sandwich for Mary. She finds a knife in a drawer and asks him to cut it for her, and he is very nervous about holding a knife again. He reluctantly cuts the sandwich, but Norman's odd behavior is creeping out Mary. She initially decides against staying with him, but Norman convinces her to stay by telling her that this is the first night back in the house after being institutionalized for so long, and is scared to be alone by himself. Norman takes her upstairs and gets some bedding for her to use. Mary goes into Norman's mother's room, but Norman suggests she sleep in his room. Norman is apprehensive about going into his mother's room, because he tells her that is where some of his troubles happened. Mary coaxes Norman into the room by reassuring him there are no ghosts in there. The room is mostly bare, except for some of the furniture which is all covered up with more sheets. The bed mattress is rolled up as well. Norman goes into his room and tosses the bedding on top of his bed and closes the door so she can get settled in for the night. Norman says goodnight, turns the lights off, and sleeps on the couch downstairs. Mary jams the door shut from the inside by putting a chair underneath the doorknob.The next morning, Norman is at the diner chopping lettuce when Mary comes in. She tells him she has decided to stay with a friend in town, rather than with Norman. Just then, a drunk Warren Toomey walks in, and goes to the kitchen window and talks to Ralph and mockingly inquires about Norman's job performance and then he sits down in a booth. Norman is reading off more orders that are placed on a wheel, while Ralph prepares the food. Mary starts to take Warren's order. Instead, Toomey insults her and suggests that she and Norman had slept together the previous night. Norman is slowly becoming angry at Warren's remarks, but tries to maintain his composure. Norman grabs an order off the wheel, but instead it is a note from Mother! It says Don't let that whore in my house again! Norman is shocked by this, and bumps into the french fry fryer, spraying hot oil on Ralph's arm.Enraged, Norman confronts Toomey, and Toomey picks a fight with Norman in front of the customers. Norman sees a knife laying nearby and Warren goads Norman into picking it up and using it. Norman doesn't pick it up, and Warren calls him a chicken, and then leaves. Norman is so traumatized by seeing the note, that he quits his job.Later that night, Mary comes back to the house and tells Norman she has reconsidered and would like to stay with him. She was very impressed with how he handled Toomey earlier. Mary goes upstairs to take a shower. Afterward, she has a funny feeling that she is being watched. In fact, there is a small peephole cut into the wall opposite the shower, and someone's eye is seen looking through the hole at her.Norman is playing the piano in the living room and is startled to hear a loud car horn blaring below. Warren Toomey is outside and he is very drunk, and he is honking the horn to get Norman's attention. He shouts that he is packing his things and moving out. Then the phone rings. Norman answers it, and after a pause, he says angrily, What? Who is this? My mother is dead! Mr. Toomey, if this is you, you're sicker than I ever was! Norman hangs up and looks out the front window. The lights to the office are still on, and Norman is convinced it was Toomey who called. Just then, a figure in a black dress comes into the office and murders Toomey by stabbing him as he packs to leave the motel. The murder goes unnoticed, as Mother spends all night in the motel parlor cleaning up the evidence of her crime.The next day, Norman's doctor, Dr. Raymond, pays a visit asking Norman why he quit his job at the diner and Norman tells Dr. Raymond that he has decided to dedicate himself to fixing up his motel to make it a legimate business. Norman also tells Dr. Raymond that he has been receiving notes as well as annymous phone calls from someone claiming to be his late mother. Dr. Raymond agrees to look into it.Up in the house, Mary is putting on makeup when she sees a flicker of light relfected in the bathroom mirror and realizes that there is a small hole in the wall leading to Mother's bedroom. Worried, Mary runs out of the house and down the hill where she meets with Norman still talking with Dr. Raymond. She casualy introduces herself to Norman's doctor and explains that she used to work at the diner as well and is now staying on the property to help Norman fix up his motel. Dr. Raymond thanks Norman for his time and drives away.Dr. Raymond goes to the police station in nearby Fairview where he meets Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) and tells him about Norman telling him about receiving prank phone calls from someone claiming to be his mother and wants a tap put on Norman's phone, but the sheriff refuses because there are no grounds for that nor has there been any evidence of a crime being committed as of yet. Dr. Raymond leaves and says that he will get to the bottom of what is going on at the Bates Motel.Later that day, while painting part of the motel building, Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he sees a figure standing in the window of this mother's old bedroom. He walks up to the house, where he enters his mother's old bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him into the attic, where he is locked in by an unseen person.While he is up there, another murder happens in the basement of the house: two teenagers sneak into the basement to smoke pot and make out, but suddenly the figure in the black dress appears and knifes the boy to death. The girl escapes and later returns with the sheriff. In the meantime, Mary finds Norman sleeping in the attic, but the door is unlocked.The sheriff and his deputy arrive at the Bates house where they ring the doorbell and they question Norman and Mary (both of them clearly acting very tense) about the alleged murder. The sheriff investigates the fruit cellar where the killing took place hours earlier, but finds it suspiciously neat and orderly. Norman is confused and wants to admit that something strange is going on, but Mary interjects and claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. Mary also give Norman an alibi by saying that she was with him all afternoon and they both were not in the house when the alleged murder took place. After the sheriff and deputy leave, Norman is aghast. Why did you lie to the sheriff like that? he asks. Mary says, I had to say something, they were going to arrest you!All the evidence suggests that Norman is back to his old ways, but Mary is insistent. It couldn't have been you, you're not like that anymore. Later that evening, Mary is startled when she discovers someone looking at her through the peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, but Norman is downstairs and out of reach... so it can't be him. Mary draws a gun and starts checking the house, but the gun saddens Norman. That's because of me, isn't it? he says. They are horrified to find a bloody rag that someone has stuffed down the bathroom toilet. Norman is despondent, convinced that his blackouts are re-ocurring and that he is responsible for the bloody rag, and whatever crime it is connected with.Mary says she's going down to check the motel, and one of the film's many plot twists occurs. In the parlor of the motel is Lila Loomis--Mary's mother. She's the one who has been calling Norman saying she's his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window, before disappearing and adding to his frail mental state. Mary has been helping her, and was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic as well as leaving all of the notes from Mother for Norman to find at the house and at the diner, but Mary's growing feelings for Norman have been causing her to reconsider her actions. It also explains how she knows Norman could not have been responsible for the murder of any young boy in the basement of the house because he was locked in the attic during that time. However, Lila sees the murder as a happy coincidence, not caring if Norman would be re-committed over a murder that wasn't his crime.The next day, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's true identity and informs Norman exactly who has been living with him. He also orders Norma Bates' body to be exhumed, just to prove to Norman that she can't be the one haunting him.Back at the house, when Norman confront's Mary, she admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, but that Lila won't stop. Why did you stop? Norman asks. Just then the phone rings, and Norman angrily answers it right away, saying Hello, Mrs. Loomis? Suddenly Norman's tone changes and he says I'm sorry... Mother. Mary gets angry and picks up an extension to confront Lila, but there's nobody on the line with Norman as whoever was on the other line hangs up when Mary speaks into the phone.Mary goes to Lila's hotel and they have a big fight that's overheard by a hotel bartender. Mary tells Lila that she wants her to stop bothering Norman, and Lila accuses her of being in love with a psychopath. Lila, convinced that she's winning the good fight, hurries over to the house for one final push over the edge for Norman. She is being followed by Dr. Raymond.Lila sneaks into the cellar and removes her Mother costume from under a loose stone in the floor. However, she is confronted by another Mother figure in a black dress and is killed with a butcher knife through the mouth. Dr. Raymond enters the house looking around, and sees the cellar door wide open. He enters the cellar, but no one is in sight (implying that Mother may have hid the body and slipped away through the cellar exit which is never locked). Norman enters the cellar and asks Dr. Raymond what is he doing there. The doctor tells Norman that he has been following Lila Loomis, but Norman seems oddly disinterested, making Dr. Raymond leave.Meanwhile, Mary discovers that Mr. Toomey's car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Sheriff Hunt questions Mary about being the daughter of Lila Loomis and that Dr. Raymond had visited him to inform him about his suspicions about her. When Mary overhears the sheriff talking to his deputies about bringing Norman in for questioning she slips away.Mary returns to the house and tries to get Norman to escape with her. They'll lock you up again! she pleads. Norman refuses to run, and instead tries to get Mary to admit to what she's been doing to him. The phone rings at the house and Norman answers and starts to speak to his Mother. But it is Dr. Raymond on the other line calling from the motel parlor who tells Norman that he contacted the local phone company and they had traced the phone calls to the house from the parlor phone at the motel. Once again, Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman (Dr. Raymond hangs up). But then, Norman begins talking about Mary to the voice on the phone and says Oh no, Mother. You can't make me... KILL her...Terrified, Mary goes down to the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with a large butcher knife, and goes to confront Norman in the outfit. It is at this point that things rapidly spiral out of control. Norman refuses to acknowledge Mary standing in front of him in the costume, so Mary instead goes upstairs to the extension phone and tries to talk Norman into hanging up. But she hears on the other end that Norman is only talking to a dial tone... for there is no one on the other line. Mary realizes that Norman has turned completely insane again due to her and Lila's manipulation of events.Losing sight of Norman, Mary is startled when someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house to expose Norman's tormentors. Stabbed, Raymond's body falls over the balcony and lands in the foyer. Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a now deranged Norman, who swears to cover up for Mother. Norman, I am not your mother, I am Mary! she frantically tells him. Norman tries to reach for the knife, but Mary stabs him in the chest. Norman backs Mary down the steps into the basement, and Mary keeps stabbing Norman, once in the palm of each hand. Norman grabs the knife blade firmly with both hands, with Mary still holding onto the other end, which severely cuts Norman's palms even further and a lot of blood pours out. Norman is weak from blood loss and stumbles on a pile of coal, knocking it loose and revealing Lila's body. Mary, distraught at seeing her mother's dead body, attacks him and is killed when the police enter and shoot her dead.At the police station that evening, the sheriff puts together a fairly inaccurate account of the what we know has happened, identifying Mary as the murderer of the teenage boy as well as Toomey, and that she may have killed Lila as well. Having received medical treatment for his wounds, Norman is sitting a short distance away in a daze and goes along with the story... and the movie goes on to its final twist.Norman returns to the Bates house where he shovels coal into the house furnace as well as wanders aimlessly around the house, now alone. A little later, Norman makes a sandwich for himself when a woman walks up the steps. Norman has boiled water and set a place for a meal when there is a knock at the back door; he answers the door to find Emma Spool, from the diner. Ms. Spool sits at the table and Norman gives her a cup of poison tea. Out of the blue, Norman asks her, Are you really my mother? She tells him that she is his real mother and that Norma Bates was her sister and his aunt. I was too young to have a baby, besides I had problems of my own, she tells him, alluding to the fact that she as well was institutionalized. You had already been put away by the time I got out. So I decided to wait for you. She reveals that she's the one who has been killing anybody who would make trouble for her son. As she sips the poison tea, she begins to gag.Norman suddenly kills her with a blow to the head with the coal shovel. Emma's chair collapses underneath her and she tumbles onto the floor. As she lies dying, Norman closes the curtains to the kitchen and then picks up her body and carries her upstairs to his mother's room. The audience hears the familiar voice of Mother, warning Norman not to go messing with filthy girls again. The final shots show Norman (murderously psychotic once again) reopening the Bates Motel and standing in front of the house... waiting.

title: Black Christmas
synopsis: On a snowy winter night on Christmas Eve, in the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house, Lauren (Crystal Lowe) is getting changed into her pajamas. In the next room Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is writing a Christmas card to her half-sister, Leigh (Kristen Cloke). Suddenly she hears something from her closet. She goes over to the closet door and looks inside. Nothing but clothes. She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing. Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head. In the struggle, the figure stabs the pen into her eye.At a mental institution not far away, Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) is being served his Christmas dinner. He is locked away, rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair, safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights. The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children's ward. Security guard J. Bailey (Ron Selmour) makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year. The orderly and Santa walk away, leaving the security guard alone in the hall. Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard. The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting, except on the newspaper is written I'll be home for Christmas. The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy's chair rocking back and fourth. He quickly opens the cell and goes inside, to find a hole in the wall. He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole, as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane. Billy leaves the cell and kills the man dressed as Santa. He steals his outfit, stuffs his body in a bag, and leaves the institution, dumping the bag in the dumpster with the man's hand sticking out from the bag.Outside of the sorority house, Kelli Presley (Katie Cassidy) and her boyfriend Kyle Autry (Oliver Hudson) are talking in his car. She tells him that she is going to spend Christmas with her roommates but that she will make it up to him. He is disappointed because this is their first Christmas together. She kisses him goodbye and goes inside the house. As she does her fellow sorority sister Megan Helms (Jessica Harmon) calls Kyle on his cell phone. Meanwhile, Megan is in her room, watching an old home made porn movie that features her and Kyle. Kyle hangs up the phone. Kelli goes inside and greets everyone, including Melissa Kitt (Michelle Trachtenberg), her best friend. Heather Fitzgerald (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dana Mathis (Lacey Chabert), Lauren Hannon and Ms. MacHenry (Andrea Martin), the house mother who loves all of the girls and accepts their flaws.They have a secret santa gift giving thing going and Ms. Mac wants to know who got Billy. According to her, Billy (Cainan Wiebe) killed his family here. When Billy was born, he has a liver disorder that makes his skin yellow. His father loves him regardless but his mother is disappointed and wants nothing to do with him. They live in the house that is now the sorority house. As Billy gets a bit older he is treated even worse by his mother, who has become an alcoholic. On Christmas his mother tells him Santa was shot down by the Russians. His father, however, tells him he has a present for him hidden in a stow-away space in Billy's closet. Billy goes into his room, which will become Eve's in the present day, and finds a telescope, maing him very happy. A few years later his mother and father are not getting along very well, and his mom is having an affair. Billy hears them arguing and looks under their door to witness his father with a bag over his head and his head being bashed in with a hammer. Billy runs back to his room as his mother and her lover take the body outside and begin to bury it in the crawl space under the house. Billy is watching this and is discovered. His mother chases him into the attic and locks him in there.All of the girls are horrified by this story but Ms. Mac assures them it is all true. Heather says she was the one who drew Billy's name for secret Santa but she thought it was wrong to buy him a gift because he was a murderer and it was offensive to the birth of Jesus to make a mockery of gift giving. Heather starts to go upstairs to her room but runs into Eve Agnew (Kathleen Kole). Eve has been upstairs the whole time and is leaving to go visit her family. She gives Heather her secret santa gift, a crystal statue of a unicorn. Heather is less than impressed and bids Eve farewell. Eve goes towards the door but Ms. Mac tells her she has a present for her. Before she can find it, Eve leaves, obviously disappointed by Heather's reaction.Kelli and Lauren go upstairs to tell Clair and Megan they are going to open the presents. Clair obviously doesn't answer. Lauren pounds on the door and says she is going to steal her presents if she doesn't get down here. Laughing, Kelli does this on Megan's door. Megan tells them to go away and she doesn't want to open presents. They leave and Megan hears a snow globe tune playing in the attic. She goes into the attic and asks if someone is playing a joke. She gets more then she bargained for when she finds Clair's body by the window in a rocking chair. Someone comes from behind and smashes the snow globe into her head. She falls onto the ground as a bag is put over her head. She fights back, but the figure rips out one of her eyes with their bare hand!The home phone rings, Melissa answers it and puts it on loud-speaker. The caller is making all sorts of weird noises. Lauren teases him, and the caller threatens to kill Lauren before hanging up. Heather says someone is obviously sick in the head and doesn't need to be provoked by Lauren. Melissa checks the caller ID and is surprised to see it's coming from Megan's cell. They assure themselves it's just a joke.They open their presents, with Ms. Mac getting some lingerie as a gag gift. Everyone laughs and Kelli goes back upstairs to check on the girls. Kyle suddenly pops out of Megan's room. Kelli screams and the other girls rush upstairs. Kyle apologizes and says he wanted to surprise her. Ms. Mac asks if Megan is in her room and Kyle says he doesn't know. Lauren asks him how he could have just been in her room and not know if she is in there. He explains that it's really dark in there. He makes a joke about Billy getting her. He then tells everyone another story about Billy's past.Billy was kept in the attic for many years. His mother and stepfather lived happily without him. Everything was wonderful except his mom couldn't get pregnant by his step-father...so she crept into the attic and had sex with Billy, her own son! Nine months later she gave birth to a baby girl named Agnes (Dean Friss). As Agnes grew older, Billy became jealous. One Christmas, Agnes got a doll for a present. A jealous Billy releases a tantrum and breaks the attic door open and rushes to the living room, attacking Agnes and pulling out one of her eyes, stabbing his stepfather in the face and beating his mom to death with a dough roller. When the police arrive on the scene, they find him eating a cookie made from his mother's flesh. Agnes was put into an orphanage and no one knows where she is today.The girls are freaked out by the story. Kelli goes inside Megan's room and finds the porn video on the computer. She breaks down and Kyle tells her it was from a long time ago. Kelli screams for him to leave the house and he becomes enraged, calling the women spoilt bitches. Ms. Mac goes off on him about treating Kelli like that, pushing him towards the stairs. As Kyle leaves, a figure is standing by the tree looking at the presents. Ms. Mac asks who the person is. Clair's half-sister, Leigh tells the girls that Claire never called her, telling her she was ready to be picked up and she is worried. Dana says she even had no idea Clair had a sister. Leigh explains they are only half-sisters and are trying to get to know each other.Suddenly the power goes out in the house. Dana says the circuit breaker is under the house and she will go turn it on. She goes outside and smokes, dropping her cigarette into a hole on the porch. She hears someone underneath it. Taking her flashlight she opens the door to the crawl space and looks inside. Suddenly someone grabs her, pulling her in. The two struggle as the figure grabs a gardening tool and stabs Dana in the head. Lauren is beyond drunk now, having been drinking booze the whole night. Melissa tells her she smells and needs to shower. As she showers, someone watches from a broken tile in the floor. After the shower, Lauren goes to bed.Everyone starts asking where the other girls are, since Clair, Megan and Dana have disappeared. Kelli questions what is taking Dana so long, and is even more startled when someone calls from Dana's cell number and hangs up. The rest of the girls go outside to look for Dana. Heather and Leigh find Eve's car still parked outside. They open the car door and scream as Eve's severed head rolls out. The girls scream and run back into the house, locking the door behind them. Kelli calls the police but because of the snow it may take over two hours for them to arrive. Ms. Mac tells everyone that they can pile into her car and try to find help. Kelli says that they won't get far and that they need to stick together. Heather says she wants to leave, and Ms. Mac tells the girls that they can stay and she will go with Heather to find help. The two go outside and get in the car. Ms. Mac gets out of the car to scrape the ice off of the windshield. As she begins to scrape Billy's yellow eye comes into view inside the car. Ms. Mac gasps as he kills Heather, her blood spraying all over the windshield. Ms. Mac falls against the garage door, causing an icicle to fall from above which impales her head.Leigh notices that Ms. Mac hasn't left yet. She decides to go see what's going on. Kelli decides to go out with her, leaving Melissa and a sleeping Lauren behind. As they leave the house a figure grabs Heather's unicorn statue and walks down the hall. In the garage, Leigh slips on Ms. Mac's blood and screams. Upon hearing this Melissa rushes towards the stairs. A figure grabs wraps a bag over her head, slamming her into a wall. She rips the bag off and rushes through the house and into her room. She grabs a stick and hits the figure with it. Melissa opens a window and is going to climb out but the figure throws an ice-skate at her, cutting off the back of her head.Kelli and Leigh rush inside and call for Melissa. There is no answer and they go to Lauren's room, closing the door behind them. But someone is on the other side of the door and kicks it open. It's Kyle. Leigh attacks him and he throws her against Lauren's bed, causing the covers fall off of Lauren, who is very much dead with her eyes gouged out! Everyone screams and Kyle insists he isn't the killer. Kelli calls Lauren's cell phone and hears it ringing in the attic. She explains that the killer might be in the attic with her phone. Kyle opens the attic door and is pulled inside. Kelli and Leigh try to get into the attic but the door is slams shut. Kyle fights back as a bag is put over his head. Kelli breaks the door open and witnesses Kyle being stabbed with the unicorn statue, then one of his eyes being ripped out and eaten! Leigh attacks the figure and is thrown across the attic, discovering her half-sisters body still in the rocking chair. The figure attacks Kelli and Leigh tries to help but is knocked into a hole in the floor. A bag is put over Kelli's head but she grabs a fork and stabs the figure in the eye. She gets up and sees the figure has a glass eye. It's Agnes. Kelli tells Agnes everything is okay and she doesn't have to do this. She tells him her brother isn't here, he is still locked away. Agnes tells her that she doesn't have a brother, only a father. Billy comes from behind and lights a candle.Agnes attacks Kelli but is knocked into another hole in the floor that pins her between the walls! Billy pushes Kelli into the same hole, accidentally knocking over the candle. Kelli has grabbed onto a string of Christmas light attached to a small tree, trying to keep from falling completely in. She screams for help as Agnes starts to crawl up the hole. Leigh comes to her rescue, smashing open the wall. Agnes grabs Leigh's head but she manages to fight her off. Leigh runs through the house and smashes out another wall, finally reaching the spot where Kelli is trapped. Billy is climbing into the hole and Agnes is crawling up it! Leigh grabs Kelli and pulls her to safety as the Christmas tree catches fire (along with the rest of the attic) and falls into the hole, burning Agnes and Billy. The two survivors rush outside.At the hospital Kelli is going to have some tests done to make sure she is okay. Leigh has a present in her hand from Clair. She tells Kelli she wants to open it now because she won't be able to open it in front of her family. She says that she is glad she got to know Clair before all of this happened. She opens the present and finds a watch engraved with Family Forever. She starts to cry as a nurse comes in and tells Kelli they need her for some x-rays.Some time later Leigh goes back to Kelli room to see if she is back from the x-rays. A body with blonde hair lays in the bed, but as she approaches the person turns over to reveal Agnes. Leigh screams as Agnes grabs her by the throat and snaps her neck.Kelli comes back into the room and feels something is wrong. She finds Leigh's new watch. She sees blood on the ceiling above her and starts to leave the room, but Agnes grabs her from behind the curtain and starts to strangle her. Kelli grabs a defibrillator paddle and shocks Agnes in the head with it, killing her. This is the ending for the UK version. The US version continues from here when Billy comes down from the ceiling, as Kelli rushes from the room. She grabs some crutches that are in the hall and starts to beat him with it. She turns to run, thinking he is unconscious but he grabs her foot, causing her to fall over a medical cart. Billy grabs a scalpel from the pile of medical supplies now on the floor and takes chase. Kelli rushes to the stairs as Billy comes from behind, slashing her with the scalpel. She grabs him and throws him over the stairway, causing him to fall on top of the Christmas tree below, impaling him. His intestines spew out, he is very much dead, and Kelli is left to look on in shock as the credits start...

title: Halo 3
synopsis: The following occurs directly after the events in Halo: Uprising. Background: The Covenant currently occupies Earth, and is amassed at an excavation of an artifact of Forerunner origin.It is a night sky: several bright pinpoints of white lights hang in the center. It's a tranquil forest, with lust forestry and a winding river. A fireball hurtles through the sky. Then, Cortana's voice begins whispering:Cortana: They let me pick. Did I ever tell you that? Choose whichever Spartan I wanted. You know me. I did my research. Watched as you became the soldier we needed you to be. Like the others, you were strong and swift and brave. A natural leader. But you had something they didn't. Something no one saw... but me. Can you guess? Luck. Was I wrong?Sergeant Major Johnson and his squad find the Master Chief lying on the jungle ground after having fallen through the atmosphere. It seems that the Chiefs armor is in partial lockdown, with its owner unconscious. Just as the Sergeant radios for extraction, Master Chief surprises the squad by regaining consciousness. Johnson rebukes the Chief, saying, You crazy fool, why do you always jump? One day you're going to land on something as stubborn as you are! After a quick systems check, the Marines and their new found ally, the Arbiter, head out towards the river for evac. They reach the river and the Pelicans, but before they are able to board, the drop ships are attacked by Banshees. Johnson and his squad disappear in the ensuing chaos and are presumably captured. It is now up to the Chief and the Arbiter to rescue him. They eventually come across an UNSC outpost, which has been taken over by the Covenant. Both the Chief and the Arbiter push though waves of enemy to take back the outpost and rescue the captured Marines. Their victory is short lived, however; only moments after the fight, Covenant reinforcements arrive and the outpost falls under attack once again. Just as it seems like they are about to be overrun, Pelicans arrive and spray the Covenant ranks with missiles.The Pelicans bring the Chief, Arbiter, Johnson and his squad to a concealed base deep in the jungle. Master Chief meets up with Commander Miranda Keyes in the Ops Center, and they begin to discuss tactics with Admiral Hood. With only a few ships left, the Admiral has little choice but to throw everything he has at the remaining Covenant hovering over the artifact. However, to do so, the Chief has to clear all anti-aircraft batteries from the city of Voi. Halfway through the discussion, the transmission is interrupted by the Prophet of Truth, who claims that Earth will burn until its surface is but glass, and that not even the demon will survive. Realizing that an attack is imminent, Keyes orders an evacuation, telling all able bodied Marines to prepare to fight. The Covenant begin to invade the bunkers, so the Master Chief and the Arbiter set off to repel the enemy while Johnson and his squad set up a bomb to destroy the base- and the invaders. Halfway through the battle, Johnson is driven out of the Ops Center by Brutes. The Chief is forced to return to the Ops Center and rearm the bomb, and then make a speedy getaway via the elevator in the hangar.Following the plan of attack outlined by Lord Hood, the Master Chief must clear a path into the city of Voi. Using spare Warthogs from the barracks, the Chief, Arbiter, and some Marines fight their way through the Tsavo Highway. After several moments of high-speed travel and copious amounts of fighting, the team comes across a destroyed section of the highway and must continue on foot. This is hardly a favorable circumstance for the Marines, as they are massively outnumbered by the Covenant. The Chief is forced to fight through waves of Brutes on foot while waiting for re-supplies. Eventually, a Pelican circles ahead and drops some supplies as well as a Warthog. They finally reach the end of the highway and encounter a gigantic Brute barricade, complete with energy barriers, turrets, and several Wraiths. Taking out the Brutes one by one, the Chief and the Arbiter finally are able to destroy the barrier blocking the tunnel and drive through.Having reached the outskirts of Voi, the team comes across the first anti-aircraft battery. It just so happens that the entire area is swarming with Ghosts and Wraiths, giving the Chief and the Arbiter no choice but to jump into battle. The field turns into general pandemonium as explosions blow craters into the ground and vehicles explode into blue flames. Eventually, all anti-aircraft batteries are neutralized... but a scout report tells the Chief that something big is on its way. A Scarab suddenly looms overhead, firing beams of plasma at the Marines. Master Chief boards the Scarab and, with a few well placed rockets to the power core, destroys the walking tank. With the Scarab out of the way, the Chief and the Arbiter receive orders to take out the anti-aircraft cannon in the vicinity. They head in that direction, rescuing several workers and killing a pair of hunters. They reach the heavily guarded cannon and take out all the opposition. Again, a few well placed shots into the core of the cannon destroy it, rendering the skies clear for an aerial assault on the Covenant war ships. MAC cannons boom as Human gun ships open fire on the Covenant, while the Chief and the Arbiter watch. But the attack is cut short by the abrupt activation of the artifact. Blown back by the shock wave, the Chief and the Arbiter rise to their feet to witness the Covenant ships entering into a gigantic, stable slipspace portal. As the Human ships are recovering from the shock wave, another, smaller slipspace portal opens and a Flood-controlled Covenant ship crash-lands nearby:Arbiter: What is it? More Brutes?Chief: Worse.The Flood immediately begins to spread though the city and hoards of combat forms attack all that move. The Elites begin to deploy drop pods to help manage the outbreak, and tip off the Master Chief that Cortana may be somewhere in the ship. The Chief wades through the sea of zombies and manages to get inside. He locates a memory module only to meet 343 Guilty Spark, who insists on transporting the module for safekeeping and repairs. Recalling the events on the first Halo where Guilty spark tried to kill him, he reluctantly lets Spark carry it. The Master Chief escapes the ship, and the Elites proceed to glass the continent in order to contain the Flood. They regroup in the Elite carrier Shadow of Intent, high above Voi, where Guilty Spark manages to repair the module and deliver Cortanas disturbing message:Cortana: High Charity... the Prophets' holy city, is on its way to Earth, with an army of Flood. I can't tell you everything. It's not safe. The Gravemind... it knows I'm in the system. But it doesn't know about the Portal, where it leads. On the other side, there's a solution; a way to stop the Flood, without firing the remaining Halo rings. Hurry, Chief! The Ark... there isn't much time.Master Chief insists on following Cortanas advice against a reluctant Admiral Hood. Both fleets prepare themselves and follow the Covenant through the portal.The fleet exits slipspace at the Ark, which is surrounded by the Covenant fleet. The Elite fleet engages the Covenant while Pelicans filled with ODSTs, the Chief, and the Arbiter stream towards the Ark. Upon landing on the surface, Guilty Spark announces that the Prophet of Truth has barricaded himself in the core of the facility and has activated a barrier around it. Destroying the generators will drop a portion of the shield, and allow the Marines and the Elites to punch through. Johnson heads towards the third generator, the Elites go to the second and the Chief and the Arbiter fly to the first. Master Chief is gazing out of the back of the Pelican when all of a sudden the rear Pelican bursts into flames. The entire fleet goes down, destroying lots of supplies and the only Warthog. The Marines are forced to destroy the anti-aircraft batteries before re-supplying, rushing to the tower and disabling the generator. The Elites turn off the second generator immediately after. Everyone turns to observe the final tower, but it does not turn off:Johnson: Brute reinforcements, ma'am. We're pinned down!Miranda Keyes: I'm on my way!Johnson: Negative! Fire's too heavy! Everyone fall back! Now! (Static and cut-off)Miranda Keyes: Sergeant Major?! Johnson?! Can you hear me?!The Marines mobilize on the beach for an assault on the third tower. Master Chief climbs into a Hornet attack craft and escorts the Pelicans and Phantoms to the generator. After taking out several anti-air batteries and enemy Phantoms, the troops drop off on the towers platform. Fighting through the entire building, they finally reach the top and shut off the generator. As Shadow of Intent begins its bombardment of the core, the now Flood city of High Charity shoots out of a slipspace portal, showering the area with debris. Shadow of Intent is shredded by this shrapnel, which render its weapons systems useless. Moreover, the Flood is now outside of the galactic target area; the Halos wont stop them anymore. Dispatching the local Flood threat, the Chief regroups with the rest.
A quick journey by Hornet, interrupted only by two Scarabs, brings Master Chief, the Arbiter, the Elites and the Marines into the core of the Ark.As the Chief and the Arbiter rush as quickly as they can to the top, Sergeant Johnson is being beaten by his Brute captives. Seeing as how the Prophet of Truth is about to use Johnson to activate the rings and Master Chief isn't anywhere near the top, Miranda Keyes crashes a Pelican through the upper window. She is quickly outnumbered however, and reaches a mutual understanding with Johnson. She needs to kill them both so none of them can be used to activate the rings. Just as she is about to shoot Johnson, she makes eye contact with him and hesitates- then falls to the ground, dead, her back riddled with spikes. The Prophet drops his spiker with disdain:Truth: Your forefathers wisely set aside their compassion... Steeled themselves for what needed to be done... I see now why they left you behind. You were weak, and Gods must be strong.Truth grabs Johnsons hand and forces it on the activation button. Instantly the Control Terminal begins to change and seven holographic halo rings light up one by one. At the end of the corridor, the Chief and Arbiter emerge from the lift just in time to witness the activation. As they are about to rush in, two pure Flood tank forms drop from above:Flood: Do not shoot, but listen! Let me lead you safely to our foe. Only you can halt what he has set in motion!The unlikely union of Flood, Human, and Elite rush down the corridor to Truth. With flood forms swarming over every inch of the terminal and the combined efforts of the Chief and the Arbiter, all Brute opposition is quickly put down and the Prophet cornered. Truth continues to spew his religious speech even when threatened at sword point, declaring at the end that he is the voice of the Covenant. The Arbiter retorts that because Truth is the voice, he must be silenced, and plunges his sword through Truth. As the Prophet crumples to the ground, a sinister laugh echoes through the facility and the Flood forms turn to face the Chief and the Arbiter. We trade one villain for another, the Arbiter observes. Johnson rushes to the Pelican with Keyes's body and starts to fly the ship out. Master Chief and the Arbiter try to grab hold but are knocked off Flood forms. They fight their way back to the lift and upon finding it broken, jump down the dark shaft.The room is dark, with exposed wiring lighting up the area in intervals with a shower of sparks. They are scanning the room for hostiles when a purple flicker catches Master Chiefs eye. He jumps up and chases it around the corner. The purple flicker forms into an image of Cortana, which keeps on walking. Chief follows the image of Cortana until it stops at a panel. He presses the button and an observation panel opens up to reveal a giant, incomplete Halo rising out of the fog:Arbiter: A replacement. For the ring you destroyedMaster Chief: (To Guilty Spark) When did you know?343 Guilty Spark: Just now. But I had my hopes. What will you do?Master Chief: Light it.343 Guilty Spark: Then we are agreed! A tactical pulse will completely eradicate the local infestation! I will personally oversee the final preparations. Though it will take time to fabricate an activation index.Arbiter: How will you light it?The Chief turns and looks at High Charity, deep in thought.Two banshees land gingerly on the floor of the Flood hive, the former Covenant holy city of High Charity. The Chief and the Arbiter dismount. The entire city is built out of organic material that squishes under boot; gaping, pulsing, oozing orifices and corridors reminiscent of the inside of an intestine. Master Chief and the Arbiter do little more than shoot Flood forms while rushing to find Cortana. Along they way, they are assaulted with transmissions from a tortured Cortana and an aggravated Gravemind:Gravemind: Child of my enemy, why have you come? I offer no forgiveness... For a father's sins are passed to his son. Of course, you came for her. But we exist together now. Two corpses in one grave.Cortana: A collection of lies; that's all I am! Stolen thoughts and memories!Cortana: It was the coin's fault!* I wanted to make you strong, keep you safe. I'm sorry, I can't.Cortana: What's your name? It's very nice to meet you. You like games? So do I.*Cortana: I'm just my Mother's shadow... don't look at me, don't listen! I'm not what I used to be... *Gravemind: Time has taught me PATIENCE. But basking in new freedom, I will know ALL THAT I POSSESS!Cortana: I have walked the edge of the abyss. I have seen the future. And I have learned. There will be no more sadness. No more anger. No more envy.Gravemind: SUBMIT! END HER TORMENT AND MY OWN! You will show me what she hides! Or I shall feast upon your BONES!!The Chief begins to reach the end of the hallway.Cortana: This is UNSC AI Serial Number CTN0452-9. I am a monument to all your sins.The Chief rushes to the end of the hallway, to find Cortana in a Stasis Shield in on of the panels in the room. He beats and bashes the shield until it finally breaks. On a holographic projector lies Cortana. Master Chief tells Cortana that when he makes a promise, he keeps it; referring to Halo 2 where he promised to return for her. She slowly gets up, recovering her strength and presenting the Chief with the activation index from Installation 04. Asking him how he was going to get out, the Chief responds, saying Thought I'd try shooting my way out, mix things up a little. He then inserts Cortana into his armor. As they head out, Cortana remarks with tenderness, Just keep your head down, there's two of us in here now, remember.**Cortana advises that they destroy High Charity. With practiced ease, Master Chief takes out the reactors and sends them into critical meltdown. Running and gunning, they make it to a downed Pelican and board. With Flood tentacles clawing at the ship and explosions rocking it back and forth, they craft struggles for every bit of altitude. They just barely escape a massive explosion, and head towards the new Halo ring.*These lines refer to the prequel, The Fall of Reach. The coin and the game is a test that Dr. Halsey performed with John 117 as a small boy. She would flip the coin and John would demonstrate his incredible ability of always winning (or luck); he is able to discern what side of the coin would land on top when it was flipping too fast to have possibly been seen. Cortana is an imprint of Dr. Halsey, a collection of her brainwaves and personality.**This is the line of dialogue spoken by Cortana in Halo: Combat Evolved when you loose your first health bar in combat. She speaks it with rebuke in Halo 1, and with nostalgic love in Halo 3.The Pelican crash lands into a snowy bank, revealing an area that looks remarkably like the control room from Combat Evolved. Sergeant Johnson is bringing the frigate Forward unto Dawn closer to the control room for their escape strategy. Gravemind has more than half a mind to stop them, however, and sends waves of dispersal pods at them. With Flood forms rushing up at them from every direction, the Chief and the Arbiter haul as fast as they can to the control room, with Johnson providing cover with a spartan laser. They reach the top and Guilty Spark opens the door for them, shutting them just in time to block the Flood. Guilty Spark excitedly explains that the ring would be ready to fire in a few days. Its incompletion renders its destruction imminent should it be fired now, but of course, thats what the Chief needs. Upon hearing this, Guilty Spark goes crazy and attacks Johnson, Master Chief, and the Arbiter. Spark reveals a bit of Forerunner history at this point, saying You are the child of my makers. Inheritor of all they left behind. You are Forerunner. But this ring is mine!The armor of Master Chief and the Arbiter disperse most of Guilty Sparks energy, but it cuts straight through Johnson's ballistic armor. Master Chief opens fire on Guilty Spark, and watches as his bullets ping off Spark uselessly. Suddenly, a laser beam lances through the air and Spark is blasted across the room. A mortally wounded Johnson hands an overheated Spartan laser to Master Chief, telling him to kick Sparks ass. Several shots from the Spartan laser later and Spark explodes in a shower of... sparks. Master Chief tries to revive Johnson, but it is clear that he is dieing. Johnson tells chief to keep Cortana with him always, and to never let her go... send me out with a bang. Cortana activates the ring, and everyone runs back outside. Getting into the Warthog that Johnson used to get here, they speed away with Halo crumbling around them.* The Warthog just barely makes a jump into the hangar of the frigate Forward unto Dawn as the Installation crumbles around them. The Chief inserts Cortana into the ship as Scorpions, Warthogs, and supply boxes are sucked out by the explosion. The frigate begins to lift off into the portal when a Warthog clips the Chief, and he starts to fly out. He punches a handhold for himself into the floor, and slowly is able to crawl back into the hangar and take refuge behind a pillar:Cortana: If we don't make it...Master Chief: We'll make it.Cortana: It's been an honor serving with you, John.The Installation fires and subsequently explodes, and everything goes blank.*This is a remake of the last level in Combat Evolved.The front end of the Dawn crash lands into an ocean on earth. Rescue workers recover the half ship and pull the Arbiter from the wreckage. There is no sign of the Chief. After several days, a memorial service is held for those fallen in the war:Admiral Hood: For us, the storm has passed. The war is over. But let us never forget, those who journeyed into the howling dark and did not return. For their decision required courage beyond measure, sacrifice, and unshakable conviction that their fight; our fight, was elsewhere. As we start to rebuild, this hillside will remain barren, a memorial to heroes fallen. They ennobled all of us, and they shall not be forgotten.Admiral Hood: I remember how this war started. What your kind did to mine. I can't forgive you. But...you have my thanks, for standing by him to the end.The Arbiter shakes Admiral Hood's hand.Admiral Hood: Hard to believe he's dead.Arbiter: Were it so easy.The Arbiter leaves the Memorial. His Phantom heads back to the Shadow of Intent, hovering above. The Arbiter meets Shipmaster Rtas 'Vadum on the bridge, looking at a holographic image of Earth:Shipmaster Rtas 'Vadum: Things look different. Without the Prophets' lies clouding my vision. I would like to see our own world. To know that it is safe.Arbiter: Fear not. For we have made it so.The Arbiter clenches a fist to his chest.Shipmaster Rtas 'Vadum: By your word, Arbiter.Arbiter: Take us home.The Shadow of Intent leaves Planet Earth. Going back to the memorial, underneath the print UNSCDF March 3 2553, the numbers 117 are scratched in, to dedicate to the Master Chief, who had no picture, or belongings to be remembered by.(After the credits, deep in space) The back half of the Dawn is floating deeper into unexplored space:Cortana: Chief? Can you hear me? I thought I lost you too.Master Chief: What happened?Cortana: I'm not sure. When Halo fired, it shook itself to pieces. Did a number on the Ark. The Portal couldn't sustain itself. We made it through just as it collapsed. Well... some of us made it. But you did it. Truth and the Covenant. The Flood (she's plugged into the panel and appears). It's finished.Master Chief: It's finished.Cortana: I'll drop a beacon. But it'll be a while before anyone finds us (The Chief places himself in one of the Cryotubes). Years even... Ill miss you.Master Chief: Wake me. When you need me.Cortana smiles. The Cryotube seals, freezing the Chief.Legendary Segment: The back half of the Forward Unto Dawn is seen drifting to the night side of an unknown planet. The sun suddenly shines onto the planet, chasing away the dark and revealing the Marathon symbol on the planet side.

title: Queen of Outer Space
synopsis: We open with a long shot of a rocket awaiting launch. Captain Neal Patterson (Eric Fleming), Lt. Mike Cruze (Dave Willock) and Lt. Larry Turner (Patrick Waltz) wait outside the Colonel's office. When admitted they are introduced to Professor Konrad (Paul Birch) and told their next assignment is to take Konrad to the Space Station. They express disappointment at such an unimportant assignment, but Col. Ramsey (an uncredited Guy Prescott) cryptically tells them, There are indications of serious trouble up there. Professor Konrad will tell you about it when you're underway.The crew prepares for launch when Konrad arrives. He explains the importance of the Space Station as a launching point for all future space missions. Outside, Larry is saying goodbye to his girlfriend (an uncredited Joi Lansing). With Larry back on board, Prof. Konrad is strapped into his bed for launch. The crew grimaces with the G-forces of acceleration until they reach orbit. They navigate towards the Space Station. Konrad tells Patterson about the true nature of the mission, They've made some disturbing observations from the Space Station. Apparently we have some deadly neighbors in outer space. The Earth may be in mortal danger. At that a ray of energy from an unknown origin flashes across the screen. Multiple shots get closer to the Space Station until one makes a glancing blow. The next shot is a direct hit and the wheel-shaped craft is destroyed. The beams are approaching the spaceship, Starfire. They try to outrun the energy force and are struck. The force accelerates the craft to an incredible speed. Later they will discover the speedometer broken above the maximum pegged value. Capt. Patterson was injured by a piece of flying debris.Title and credits roll [15 minutes into the movie] over a star field. They approach a planet and crash land in the snow. The crew awakens to take stock of their situation. They deduce they are on the planet Venus and discover the air is breathable. Below the snowline they enter a jungle with strange plants and no sound at all. A strange pulsating sound pierces the silence and Prof. Konrad correctly observes, My guess is that was an electronic signal of some kind. They build a camp fire and bed down for the night. Larry takes the first watch. Mike took the watch that brought morning, but he dozed off. As a result, he didn't notice until too late the crew were surrounded by the inhabitants of the area. Women in short shirts, clear plastic high-heel shoes, and carrying ray guns take them hostage. They are marched back to the city. Once inside the city they get the impression that strangers, and particularly male strangers are not welcomed. They are brought into the Council Chamber for an audience with the rulers of Venus.A curtain parts and Queen Yllana (Laurie Mitchell) and her council, all wearing masks, take their seats at a table on a raised platform. Yllana introduces herself, I am Yllana, ruler of the city of Kadir and queen of this world. Next she asks, Why are you here? Patterson introduces himself and his colleagues, then explains, We came from Earth on a peaceful mission, but our ship was thrown off course, and we crashed here. The Queen does not believe the Earthmen. She and her council adjourn to decide their fate. Motiya (Lisa Davis), the blond woman that Larry found so captivating, leaves to tell Talleah (Zsa Zsa Gabor) of the Earthmen. Talleah, the leader of the resistance movement on Venus, decides to visit the Earthmen and decide for herself if they can be trusted to help her cause. The Earthmen are returned to the Council Chamber to hear the decision. The Queen pronounces that, You came here to spy on us, to prepare for invasion. What is the plan of attack? You will die! They are returned to the prison quarters.Konrad voices his concern, I have a sense of foreboding about them. A feeling of something monstrous, evil. Patterson adds, I'm beginning to think our being here isn't an accident. He concludes the energy beam originated on Venus. Talleah visits the Earthmen. She tells them their lives are in great danger. She confides that she is one of many who want to overthrow the Queen and makes a deal, If you help us, we are going to help you. Then she drops the bombshell, The Earth is going to be destroyed. Talleah tells of an interplanetary war Venus had ten years earlier with Mordo. Most of the cities were destroyed and lost to the jungle. Yllana led the revolt and took over from the men. Many were killed, but the men she needed are kept on a prison colony moon, Tyrus, that orbits Venus.An escort detail comes to take Capt. Patterson to see the Queen. Konrad noticed the Queen had an interest in Patterson and advises he try to charm her. Betraying her true feeling for Patterson, a jealous Talleah says, I hate her! I hate that Queen! Yllana joins Patterson in her bed chamber. She tells him, Bring me a glass of wine, Captain, and one for yourself. She sits, provocatively on the edge of the bed, showing a lot of leg. They drink. The charm appears initially to be working until she warns, If you do not give us a truthful explanation of your visit here, the Council sentence will be carried out to the letter. She does provide an escape provision for the handsome Captain. She admits to a desire for him. He asks her to take off her mask, but she refuses. By way of warning, she shows him preparations of the Beta Disintegrator that will be used to destroy the Earth. In a moment of weakness she allows Patterson to unmask her. He is shocked by the visage. Severe radiation burns have left the angry Queen with a scarred face of blue and black skin, with open red sores. For that you will die, she proclaims. Yllana replaces her mask and calls her guards to escort Patterson back to his cell. When alone, she removes her mask, looks at her face in the mirror and sobs uncontrollably. Patterson explains to his colleagues, It was atomic radiation that disfigured her. I think its affected her mind. The four are taken to see Talleah in her lab. She introduces another of her circle, Kaeel (Barbara Darrow). Talleah tells Patterson they have no time to waste. She has learned that the Queen plans to destroy the Earth in two days. They plan to walk through the jungle to the site of the Beta Disintegrator and destroy it. Before they can leave, the guards search the lab. Since Talleah is still considered loyal she continues to work as the others hide. When the guards leave, Talleah frees her comrades and the Earthmen and they make their way through the city and escape outside.Odeena (Marilyn Buferd), who brought the Earthmen to see Talleah, has been captured and brought before the Queen. She protests her innocence, and is lulled into a sense of safety when the Queen reassures her, Odeena has always been loyal to her queen. Release her. You may go. As she turns to leave, Yllana pulls a ray gun from a guard and blasts her into smoke. Outside the city, Talleah, Patterson and the others are under radar and searchlight detection. They conclude they are safest in a cave. The guards are searching in the jungle for them. Larry leaves the safety of the group to explore the cave system. Larry is observed by something that watches from a rock ledge above him. A giant red-eyed spider pounces down on him. He screams and fights it off. The commotion draws the rest to his aid. A blast with a ray gun soon reduces the spider to a smoldering shadow on the ground. They build a fire and wait in the cave. Patterson, Larry and Mike get to know their female companions on a more intimate basis. Konrad remains unattached, so he volunteers to go gather more wood for the fire. Outside he discovers the search party of guards have found their trail and are closing in fast. They devise a plan to have Talleah pretend to capture and march them back to the city.The Queen oversees final preparations on her Beta Disintegrator. She returns to the city to confront the Earthmen, unaware Talleah is no longer loyal. But Talleah reveals herself, I don't want your reward. One move and I kill you. Patterson orders Yllana to give orders to suspend all work on the Beta Disintegrator. Talleah adds an order of her own, You will contact the guards on Tyrus and tell them to free all the men. Yllana pretends to comply, goes to her bed and pulls a ray gun out from under a pillow, but is quickly disarmed. Patterson pulls her mask off and gives it to Talleah to masquerade as the Queen to give the orders. They tie up the Queen and hide her behind a screen. Motiya and Kaeel leave to warn their partisans at the weapon site. The masked guards enter the Queen's chamber. Talleah orders them out, but Yllana kicks over the screen revealing the plot. Talleah is disarmed and unmasked. The Queen is restored to power. Yllana delays the execution of the traitors until after she destroys the Earth, but promises, For her treachery, Talleah will die last, and most horribly of all. Yllana makes one more appeal to Patterson for his love and attention, but her disfigured face even repells her guards.The Earthmen are taken to the jungle site of the weapon. While Yllana gloats, Motiya and Kaeel signal their mission is completed. On a giant screen the Earth is seen suspended in space. The Queen threatens, It took untold millions of years to create the planet you call Earth. Watch it closely Earthmen. It will be destroyed in a matter of seconds. Watch it! Yllana presses the button to start the machine. It whirrs up to speed, then makes an unexpected sound of distress. The Queen presses the button again, but all that happens is a screeching sound. She pounds on the button but still nothing happens. The machine explodes and a small fire erupts inside. The Queen enters the main operating room to work it manually. Every lever she throws only makes things worse. More explosions and more fires. A fight between the loyalists and resistance breaks out. A final fireworks display reduces the Queen to a burnt out carcass.Sometime later the Earthmen and citizens of the city assemble in the Council Chambers. A new Queen, Talleah, and her court assume their places on the dais. Talleah announces that the ship has been repaired and the Earthmen can now leave for home. They prepare to depart, but are delayed by a message for the Queen, The electronic tele-viewer is working. Earth answers us. Colonel Ramsey tells the crew that their orders are, Not to attempt a return flight in the Starfire. I will not risk his life or the lives of his men in a patched-up ship. Therefore, Captain, you and your crew will remain on the planet Venus until a relief expedition can reach you. We close with Patterson and Talleah embracing, then each principle cast member gets a credit and close-up.

title: Sex Tape
synopsis: Annie Hargrove (Cameron Diaz) is a 30-something blogger who starts off her latest post by asking readers if they remember the first time their man saw them naked. She recounts the earlier years she had with her boyfriend Jay (Jason Segel) when they were constantly having sex, regardless of who's watching or where they were. It reached the point where Annie got pregnant and she married Jay. As they had two kids, their time for sex just disappeared, and even as they look at each other naked today, even Annie doesn't want to think about it. She muses as to how they can get that drive back into their lives.Today, Annie and Jay have to deal with their bratty, ill-behaved son Clive (Sebastian Hedges Thomas) and their younger daughter Nell (Giselle Eisenberg). Even the two children can see that their parents are feeling bored at home. After dropping them off at school, Jay goes to work at a radio station where he talks to his friend Max (Nat Faxon) about Max's girlfriend and their sexting to each other while also commenting on how weird it is that Jay sends Annie pictures of his penis. Their assistant comes in and brings two iPads for Jay, since he uses separate tablets for different tasks. Any other he has left are given away.Meanwhile, Annie goes to the Piper Brother company where a team led by Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe) are looking to purchase Annie's blog, despite some of the content she puts in her posts (mentioning Jay's erections multiple times, for instance). Still, Hank is very enthusiastic about bringing Annie on board.To celebrate, Annie calls her mother Linda (Nancy Lenehan) to take Clive and Nell to her house so that Annie and Jay can have the house to themselves. Annie surprises Jay by dressing in a see-through T-shirt and pink panties while wearing roller skates. Jay becomes excited, but when they try to get into it, they are both clumsy and cannot seem to get active for sex. They try going to the kitchen and the couch, but they are unable to feel pleasure. They decide to pop open a bottle of tequila, when Annie finds one of Jay's iPads and gets the idea to make their own porno after having a chat about watching today's porn, inspired to try something new. Jay agrees, and after a couple shots of tequila, the two of them set up the iPad and try out positions from the book, The Joy of Sex. After 3 hours, the tape is done, and Annie tells Jay to delete the video as they fall asleep.The next day, the couple hosts a party at their home for Clive's upcoming graduation ceremony. They invite their friends Robby and Tess (Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper), and their other couple friends, Punit and Kia (Kumail Nanjiani and Artemis Asteriadis), both of whom are not very happy with their married life and their two babies. After the party, Jay is outside cleaning up when he gets a text from an unlisted number that says Enjoyed your video. Thanks for sharing. Xoxo. Jay tells the person he's got the wrong number, but the person says he's got the right number and he has seen Jay's sex tape. He panics and runs to his Apple products (iPad, MacBook, Mac computer) to find that the sex tape synced to everything, including the iPads he gave out to his friends. Annie overhears the tape being played, forcing Jay to come clean about not deleting it. They realize they gave iPads to Robby and Tess, Linda, Hank, and even the mailman. They begin to grab any iPad they gave away, starting with Clive's. They grab the boy's iPad out of his hands and throw it out the window. Annie calls her mother to come watch the kids and to bring her iPad. When Linda gets there, Jay takes the iPad and deletes the video from her tablet, and he and Annie run out to stop others from seeing the tape.The couple drives over to Robby and Tess's home, as Annie suspects the xoxo is something Tess would do as a joke. When they get to their friends' house, they see that Robby and Tess are celebrating their 12th anniversary by watching the first season of Breaking Bad. Jay asks to see their iPad, and Robby jokingly asks if they made a sex tape. Jay blurts out Did you guys watch it? He and Annie then go inside and are forced to explain everything to Robby and Tess. They agree to help Annie and Jay find the next iPad, which is in Hank's possession. Tess gets his address from her sister since she is Hank's florist. Before they leave, Jay asks Robby for the iPad, and he begrudgingly hands it over to him.They get to Hank's fancy home, with Annie and Jay pretending to be collecting money for charity. Annie goes to talk with Hank while having Jay excuse himself to the bathroom by pretending he has food poisoning. In Hank's home, we see multiple ridiculous paintings of himself as characters from Disney movies (like Rafiki, Peter Pan, Geppetto, and a dwarf), and he plays some music for Annie. As Jay goes through Hank's rooms, Hank's German shepherd attacks Jay. Despite whacking it over the head with a book and causing it to run onto a moving treadmill that throws it against a wall hard, the dog continues going after Jay. Meanwhile, Hank invites Annie to do cocaine. She reluctantly agrees to it so that Hank doesn't find Jay sneaking through his place. Robby and Tess then ring the door posing as a mayor and wife from another town that are collecting used iPads. Hank gives them the one that Annie gave him, just as Jay falls out the window with the dog, and he is chased to the front door, bloodied and limping. Hank calms the dog down by saying Hakuna Matata.With that situation resolved, Annie and Jay walk back to the car, arguing about this mess. Jay admits that he decided not to delete the tape because he was happy with it and what it added to their love life, while Annie has just been frustrated with all that has been keeping them from having sex. They make up and go back to the car to find Robby and Tess getting it on in the backseat after having viewed Annie and Jay's tape.The friends drive back to Robby and Tess's house so Robby can give Jay a new shirt. The couple's obnoxiously precocious son Howard (Harrison Holzer) comes downstairs when Jay is alone to reveal to him that HE is the one that sent him the texts. Howard blackmails Jay for $25,000 so that he can take the tape off YouPorn. The boy mocks Jay for not having realized that he could have remote-wiped the tape to get it out of everyone's iPads easily instead of having gone through all the trouble.When Jay gets home, he calls Robby back to tell him about Howard's scheme, but Robby trusts his son too much to believe what Jay has said. Jay then goes to remote-wipe the tape, but then tells Annie about what Howard told him. Instead of giving in to his demands, Annie gets the address of YouPorn headquarters from their website. They grab Clive and Nell since they can't call Linda back at that time.They drive to the YouPorn building, which is closed. Jay drives the car into the door to break in. They find the control room and Jay whacks one of the servers with a bat, triggering the alarm. Before they can get out of there, the YouPorn manager (Jack Black) comes in with his wife, two bodyguards, and two attack dogs. He mistakenly believes Annie and Jay are from rival porn sites, but then deduces that they made a sex tape and are trying to get it down, which happens to be a common occurrence. After Annie and Jay introduce themselves, the manager's wife recognizes their names from Annie's blog, which she is a fan of. After talking everything over, the manager agrees to take down the video, but Annie and Jay still have to pay for the damages.The morning comes, and the family rushes back home to get the kids ready for Clive's graduation. They get to the school and sit in the auditorium. There, Annie and Jay tell each other what they love about one another and are glad that they are still together. The ceremony commences, and Clive is up to present a video he put together from the computer. Jay panics, thinking he forgot to delete the tape from his computer. Clive's video plays, which is actually his grad video, but Jay jumps off the balcony and lands on the table. Robby and Tess help him up and take him to the hospital.The family is spending time together at home, with Jay now wearing a cast on his leg and a sling around his arm. They get a call from Howard, inviting Clive to have ice cream with him and Howard's babysitter. Jay tells Clive to decline because they are having family time. The doorbell rings, and Howard asks Jay to come outside. Jay thinks Howard is going to blackmail him more, but the boy pulls out a jump-drive that contains the last remaining copy of the tape, since Howard decided to delete any other copy he had. He only wants Jay to let Clive hang out with him because he is the only friend Howard has. Jay agrees and takes the jump-drive from Howard.Jay is preparing the smash the drive with a hammer, but Annie says they should watch it just once. They load it to their computer and watch the tape, horrified and embarrassed to see themselves acting out awkward sex positions, such as Annie doing a front flip onto Jay's penis, and various other weird acts. The two of them then smash the drive with the hammer, burn it on their grill, shred it in their blender, and then finally bury the evidence for good.

title: Graduation Day
synopsis: During a high school track meet, Laura (Ruth Ann Llorens), a female runner, is pushed by the crowd and her demanding coach (who keeps screaming move it, move it, move it!). Apparently the pressure is too much for Laura who collapses right after crossing the finish line and breaking a 30 second 100 meter race. Upon examination by the coach and her teammates, Laura is dead.Some days later, Anne Ramstead (Patch Mackenzie), returning to town on leave from the U.S. Navy, is getting a ride into town from a sleazy truck driver. She asks to be dropped off when she sees a girl running by. The girl, Paula, runs into a wooded area with her earphones on. Someone is following her, and a pair of black leather gloves starts a stopwatch. The unseen person catches up to Paula and slits her throat.At the Midvale High School, the track team is waiting for Paula to show up so they can have their class photograph taken. Coach George Michaels (Christopher George) decides to have the picture taken without the student. Meanwhile, an unseen person places a photo of the track team and after circling Laura's face, crosses out Paula's face.Meanwhile, Anne arrives home to visit her mother (Beverly Dixon) and her crabby stepfather, Ronald (Hal Bokar). Anne and her mother discuss the death of their sister/daughter (who happens to be Laura). When her mother asks how long will she be visiting, Anne replies that she will be leaving after graduation day. Anne goes upstairs to her room to unpack her things, including a gray sweatshirt and a pair of black leather gloves.Later, another track member, named Sally (Denise Cheshire), is walking through the wooded area and she has an encounter with Anne, who is looking for the auditorium. Anne reacts strangely towards Sally who points out the direction to the auditorium. Later in the auditorium, Sally arrives where she sees Anne already there watching the students having a graduation rehearsal, with Anne as a special guest. Sally points out to her friends about her encounter with Anne earlier and states: Boy, that girl is weird!Afterwards, Anne goes to visit Laura's boyfriend, Kevin (E. Danny Murphy), at his house. Anne sees how odd Kevin is, claiming that his parents are away and his grandmother, who spends all the time in a chair in the living room watching TV, is stone deaf. Kevin shows Anne a photo album of Laura, and Anne gives Kevin one of Laura's track medals which he thanks her for.Another day or so later, Sally is in the locker room when the lights are shut off. She runs into two 'mean girls', named Doris (Vanna White) and Joanne (Karen Abbott), and frightens them. Sally searches the area, but finds no one. A little later, Sally the gymnast arrives in the gym area where Coach Michaels is there with a photographer to take a few photos of her doing a routine on the gym bars, but she is not able to concentrate apparently due to memories of Laura's death. Sally tries to concentrate despite Coach's encouragement words: of don't disappoint me, but she continually fails. Sally heads back to the locker room and after showering and shaving her legs, the killer arrives, wearing a gray sweatsuit, black leather gloves and a fencing mask. The masked killer then murders Sally by stabbing her through the mouth with a sword. The killer again has the stopwatch and stops it after 30 seconds.Later, the ill-tempered Principal Gugilone (Michael Pataki) is in his office arguing with his secretary. After the secretary walks out, he pulls out a switchblade knife from his coat pocket and uses it to slice an apple to eat. He puts the knife into his desk drawer, where there's various knifes as well as a stopwatch.Meanwhile, Dolores (Linnea Quigley) is on a park bench with her boyfriend Tony (Billy Hufsey), smoking marijuana and kissing when MacGregor (Virgil Frye) the school 'narc' shows up and says he had better not catch them with drugs again. He takes the joint away from them, and after Dolores and Tony walk away, MacGregor re-lights the joint for himself to smoke.Anne goes to the school metal shop to see Coach Michaels. The coach is angry about being blamed for Laura's death which resulted in a blood clot in her heart after finishing the race. Michaels says to Anne, I didn't kill your sister! I loved her! Anne leaves, still indignant towards Michaels.In the wooded area, another member of the track team, Ralph (Carl Rey) is running with his football gear, tossing a football back and forth. The two mean girls, Doris and Joanne, are there and they playfully toss the football into some trees. As Doris and Joanne run off, Ralph goes into the undergrowth to get his football where the masked killer is there, with a football affixed with a fencing blade. Ralph goes behind the trees and says to the killer Hi. Gimme my ball. The killer abides, giving Ralph his football right in the stomach. Ralph withers on the ground for a minute before he dies as the killer again has his stopwatch and stops it at 30 seconds.That night, there is a skating party for the students. They are roller skating to the tune of Gangster Rock, played by a band of men donning black and white makeup. Tony and Dolores head away from the party into the woods for make out and when Tony goes off to answer the call of nature, he is decapitated by the fencing masked killer with a pair of garden shears. Dolores is then attacked by the killer who chases her though the woods as the band Gangster Rock continues to play, drowning out her screams. The masked killer catches up to Dolores and murders her with a sword.The next morning, parents continue to call Principal Gugilone about their missing children. The principal, believing that the kids are out raising hell takes it lightly. Just then, Inspector Halliday (Carmine Argenziano) arrives to talk to Gugilone about the missing kids and says that he is here to investigate.Pete, another track team member, is seen on the track field pole vaulting. While completing the run and the vault over the bar, he lands on the mat with metal spikes hidden underneath it. The killer, standing nearby with the stopwatch, again stops it at 30 seconds.Inspector Halliday goes to speak with Coach Michaels who tells him that six students from his track team have been reported missing. But the coach is angry and tells the police inspector that he has just been fired by Principal Gugilone over Laura's death and of the bad publicity the school has been getting. Inside Coach Michael's desk are a pair of black leather gloves and a stopwatch.In the locker room, Doris and Joanne find Sally's dead body stuffed in a locker. Coach Michaels is nearby and checks the body. Kevin runs into the room after running into Doris and Joanne running out of the locker room screaming. Seeing Michaels standing before Sally's body, Kevin believes that the coach is the murderer and begins a struggle. Coach Michaels subdues Kevin and runs away from the school while Kevin gives chase. Doris and Joanne run into Inspector Halliday where the two scared teen girls tell the inspector that the coach murdered Sally.Out in the wooded area, Kevin catches up to Coach Michaels where they discover the dead body of Kevin, still lying on the ground and impaled with the fencing blade. Coach pleads his innocence, but Kevin angrily raves, You killed Laura! You all killed her! Kevin then admits to the murders and pulls out a hunting knife and a stopwatch and claims that because Coach Michaels pushed Laura during her track training and that she died, all of Laura's teammates, as well as the coach, deserve to die. Kevin claims that he and Laura were going to be married after graduation and have a future together, but all of that changed in 30 seconds during her run down the track which led to her death. Michaels and Kevin struggle on the ground for the hunting knife and the coach manages to get the hunting knife away from Kevin. Just then, Inspector Halliday shows up and sees Michaels standing over Kevin holding the hunting knife. Assuming that the coach is responsible for all the killings, Halliday shoots and kills the coach. Kevin then tells Halliday a concocted story about the coach bragging to him about killing all of the track students and the inspector buys it.Sometime later, Annie goes over to Kevin house to visit him to see how is he holding up after his brush with Coach Michaels. When no one answers the door, she lets herself in and heads up stairs to find him. Up in Kevin's bedroom, Anne finds the decomposing corpse of her sister in a rocking chair and wearing a gold-colored graduation robe. Kevin shows up and reveals that he stole Laura's body from the grave and claims that he and Laura were to be married after the graduation ceremony and that nothing (not even Laura's death) was to prevent that. When Anne backs away in terror and refuses Kevin's request to give Laura's corpse a kiss, he becomes violent once again and screams You're as bad as the others! Realizing that Kevin was the killer and not Coach Michaels, Anne strikes Kevin when he attacks her and he falls out a window with Laura's body. Anne runs away as Kevin picks up Laura's corpse and takes it back inside his house.Anne runs all the way back to the school and to the deserted track field where Kevin pursues her. Using her military training of hand-to-hand combat, Anne takes on the hunting knife-wielding Kevin in which the fight leads from the track and field to under the bleachers. There, Pete's dead body is shown with him still impaled to the spikes. After getting the upper hand, Anne kicks Kevin who backs into the spikes lodged into Pete's corpse and Kevin finally dies when he falls to the ground and stops moving.After giving her statement to the police, Anne goes home that night and while sleeping in bed, sees the blooded and undead Kevin walking into her room with a hunting knife. Anne screams but stops when her mother walks in and turns on the lights. 'Kevin' is revealed only to be her drunken stepfather. Mrs. Ramstead takes her drunken husband out of the room, while Anne still lays in bed shaken clearly traumatized by her encounter with Kevin.The next morning, Anne impassively says her goodbye to her mother and leaves town on a bus to return to the US Navy with the Graduation Day banner still up over the town's main street.

title: Det sjunde inseglet
synopsis: Text is too large - max size is 60,000 characters.




The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of
wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies
prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep.Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.
At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.The KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the darkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning against the grime.The KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a dome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and restless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius Block turns around.Behind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak.KNIGHT Who are you?DEATH I am Death.KNIGHT Have you come for me?DEATH I have been walking by your side for a long time.KNIGHT That I know.DEATH Are you prepared?KNIGHT
My body is frightened, but I am not.DEATH Well, there is no shame in that.The KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place it around the KNIGHT'S shoulders.KNIGHT Wait a moment.DEATH That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves.KNIGHT You play chess, don't you?A gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes.DEATH How did you know that?KNIGHT I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.DEATH Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player.KNIGHT But you can't be better than I am.The KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces.DEATH Why do you want to play chess with me?KNIGHT I have my reasons.DEATH That is your privilege.KNIGHT The condition is that I may live as long as I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?The KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. DEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn.KNIGHT You drew black!DEATH Very appropriate. Don't you think so?The KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, Antonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's pawn.The morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has ceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day is already scorchingly hot.The squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he grunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his horse and picks up the heavy pack.The KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and up towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his squire. JONS soon overtakes him.JONS (sings)
Between a strumpet's legs to lie Is the life for which I sigh.He stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or he pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS sings even louder.JONS (sings)
Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But your brother the Devil You will meet on every level.JONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his horse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.JONS In Frjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things. Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.
The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot sun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, wagging its tail.JONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. When he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake him awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back his hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. It is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth.JONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin and hands the bag to the knight.KNIGHT Well, did he show you the way?JONS Not exactly.KNIGHT What did he say?JONS Nothing.KNIGHT Was he a mute?JONS No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.KNIGHT Oh?JONS He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing.
(sings)
One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.KNIGHT Must you sing?JONS No.The KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road.In his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the wagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who are sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, snores loudly.JOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big trees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse.JOF Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? We're a little hard up. People aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country.He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble.JOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies.JOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.JOF Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen something. I've got to tell you about it!MIA (sits up, terrified)
What is it? What's happened?JOF Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a vision. It was real, absolutely real.MIA Oh, so you've had a vision again!MIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders.JOF But I did see her!MIA Whom did you see?JOF The Virgin Mary.MIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.MIA Did you really see her?JOF She was so close to me that I could have touched her. She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. And everything became so still in the sky and on the earth. Can you understand ...MIA What an imagination you have.JOF You don't believe me! But it was real, I tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind.MIA
Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush.JOF (embarrassed)
Why must you keep bringing that up?MIA
And then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails.JOF Well, perhaps that time I made it up. (eagerly) I did it just so that you would believe in my other visions. The real ones. The ones that I didn't make up.MIA (severely)
You have to keep your visions under control.
Otherwise people will think that you're a half-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm not so sure about that.JOF (angry)
I didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin appears before me and angels and devils like my company.SKAT (sits up)
Haven't I told you once and for all that I need my morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm telling you to shut up!His eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he left off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They sit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms vigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed and astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.MIA If we would only get some rain. Everything is burned to cinders. We won't have anything to eat this winter.JOF (yawning)
We'll get by.He says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs contentedly.MIA I want Mikael to have a better life than ours.JOF Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.MIA What's that?JOF To make one of the balls stand absolutely still
in the air.MIA But that's impossible.JOF Impossible for us -- but not for him.MIA You're dreaming again.She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.
JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.JOF I've composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to hear it?MIA Sing it. I'm very curious.
JOF I have to sit up first.He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice.JOF (sings)
On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high.He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.JOF Mia! Are you asleep?MIA It's a lovely song.JOF I haven't finished yet.
MIA I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards.JOF All you do is sleep.JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask.SKAT Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no thank you.JOF Are you going to play Death?
SKAT Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense.JOF When are we supposed to do this play?SKAT At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.
JOF Wouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? People like it better, and, besides, it's more fun.SKAT Idiot. There's a rumor going around that there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies.MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband.
JOF And what part am I to play?SKAT You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be the Soul of Man.JOF That's a bad part, of course.SKAT Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the
director of this company anyhow?SKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.SKAT Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by a thread. Your time is short. (in his usual voice) Are the women going to like me in this getup? Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead already.He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. MIA lies beside him on the grass.MIA Jof!
JOF What is it?
MIA Sit still. Don't move.JOF What do you mean?MIA Don't say anything.JOF I'm as silent as a grave.MIA Shh! I love you.Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The KNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows him in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite finished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and paint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces.JONS What is this supposed to represent?PAINTER The Dance of Death.JONS And that one is Death?
PAINTER Yes, he dances off with all of them.
JONS Why do you paint such nonsense?PAINTER I thought it would serve to remind people that they must die.
JONS Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier.PAINTER Why should one always make people happy? It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while.JONS Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting.
PAINTER Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman.
JONS If you do scare them ...PAINTER They'll think.JONS And if they think ...
PAINTER They'll become still more scared.
JONS And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests.PAINTER That's not my business.
JONS You're only painting your Dance of Death.PAINTER I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone else can do as he likes.JONS Just think how some people will curse you.PAINTER Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me.
JONS The plague. That sounds horrible.PAINTER You should see the boils on a diseased man's throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man I've painted over there.The PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain.JONS That looks terrible.PAINTER It certainly does. He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you?
JONS Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the horrors you've painted over there?PAINTER The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures
think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. Mobs of people who call themselves Slaves of Sin are swarming over the country, flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of God.JONS Do they really whip themselves?PAINTER Yes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by.JONS Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.PAINTER I think I frightened you after all.JONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.The KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.
The air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of anguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him.KNIGHT I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty.DEATH doesn't answer.
KNIGHT The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust.DEATH doesn't answer.
KNIGHT Through my indifference to my fellow men, I have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.DEATH And yet you don't want to die.KNIGHT Yes, I do.
DEATH What are you waiting for?KNIGHT I want knowledge.DEATH You want guarantees?KNIGHT Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?DEATH doesn't answer.
KNIGHT How can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to? And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?The KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. There is complete silence.KNIGHT Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that I can't shake off? Do you hear me?DEATH Yes, I hear you.KNIGHT I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me.DEATH But He remains silent.
KNIGHT
I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there.
DEATH Perhaps no one is there.
KNIGHT Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.DEATH Most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life.KNIGHT But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness.DEATH When that day comes ...
KNIGHT In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God.
DEATH You are worrying ...KNIGHT Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter.DEATH What matter is that?
KNIGHT My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.DEATH Is that why you are playing chess with Death?KNIGHT He is a clever opponent, but up to now I haven't lost a single man.DEATH How will you outwit Death in your game?KNIGHT I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.DEATH I'll remember that.DEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly.KNIGHT You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet again, and I'll find a way.DEATH (invisible)
We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue playing.The KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window.KNIGHT This is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood pulsing through it. The sun is still high in the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.He makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.Meanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly together.JONS Me and my master have been abroad and have just come home. Do you understand, you little pictor?PAINTER The Crusade.JONS (drunk)
Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God. Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. But what you said about the plague was horrible.PAINTER It's worse than that.JONS Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have your rump behind you. That's the truth.PAINTER The rump behind you, the rump behind you there's a profound truth.JONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.JONS This is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell.The KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.Outside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a woman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet she doesn't appear to be fully conscious.JONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk mumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman. JONS holds his nose.JONS That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What is it good for?SOLDIER She has had carnal intercourse with the Evil One.He whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky mess on the wall.JONS And now she's in the stocks.SOLDIER She will be burned tomorrow morning at the parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of us.JONS (holding his nose)
And you do that with this stinking mess?SOLDIER It's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile of a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the smell.JONS Neither can I.
JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments looking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes towards him.KNIGHT Have you seen the Devil?The MONK stops reading and raises his head.MONK You must not talk to her.KNIGHT Can that be so dangerous?MONK I don't know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected.KNIGHT I understand.He nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road.The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is empty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.They approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground.At the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man comes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his bag.Slowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the door. She stops and stares at the stranger.RAVEL Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the dead. These days it's quite a lucrative enterprise.The GIRL makes a movement as if to run away.RAVEL You're thinking of running to the village and telling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each of us has to save his own skin. It's as simple as that.GIRL Don't touch me.RAVAL Don't try to scream. There's no one around to hear you, neither God nor man.Slowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost total darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.JONS I recognize you, although it's a long time since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.RAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around.JONS Am I not right?The GIRL stands immobile.JONS You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced my master of the necessity to join a better-
class crusade to the Holy Land.RAVAL looks around.
JONS You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-
ache?RAVAL smiles anxiously.JONS When I see you, I suddenly understand the meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste. Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. The Lord wanted to punish us for our complacency. That is why He sent you to spew out your holy venom and poison the knight.RAVEL I acted in good faith.JONS But now you know better, don't you? Because now you have turned into a thief. A more fitting and rewarding occupation for scoundrels. Isn't that so?With a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly the GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.
JONS By all means. I'm not bloodthirsty.He bends over RAVAL.RAVEL Don't beat me.JONS I don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. But remember this: the next time we meet, I'll brand your face the way one does with thieves. (he rises)
What I really came for is to get my waterskin filled.GIRL We have a deep well with cool, fresh water. Come, I'll show you.They walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises slowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals away. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps him.JONS Jns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done beautiful and noble deeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With them, there is no limit to my kindness.He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats the GIRL on the cheek.JONS Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped you, but between you and me, I'm tired of that kind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.He laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance he turns; the GIRL is still there.JONS Now that I think of it, I will need a housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? (the GIRL nods)
As far as I know, I'm still a married man, but
I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.
That's why I need a housekeeper. (the GIRL doesn't answer but gets up)
The devil with it! Come along and don't stand there staring. I've saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.She begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but walks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.The Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.The spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are
merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands and milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.
The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink beer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps at JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay and lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have finished SKAT comes forward and bows.SKAT Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your interest. Please remain standing for a
little longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that's me.MIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. They bow, to the public.SKAT Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If you'll shut up over there, you'll see something splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I haven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to hide behind the curtain for the time being. (he wipes the sweat from his forehead)
It's damned hot. I think we'll have a thunderstorm.He places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.SKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks are flushed rose red.
He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and whistling to himself.
In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received with great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both height and volume.
SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.
The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.When he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.She becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes.Now she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.SKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.His words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks.JOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage.JOF Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my wife so frail ...VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
Does she snore?JOF May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn't snore.VOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
I think she should snore anyhow.This opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and goes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring.JOF Night and moonlight now prevail.
There snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. Jealous I am, as never before, I hide myself behind this door. Faithful is she To her lover -- not me. He soon comes a-stealing To awaken her lusty feeling. I shall now kill him dead For cuckolding me in my bed. There he comes in the moonlight, His white legs shining bright. Quiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, Tell him not that he's about to die.JOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to the left.MIA Look, there he comes in the night My lover, my heart's delight.She becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the heat.
Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall silent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.
JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression of horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to mutter half-forgotten prayers.All have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is heard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the hilltop.The cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods pulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out spasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.After the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, boys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling ecstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. They bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost rhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their bursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each
other and help each other to intensify the scourging.Now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed tightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered cross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, but the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the face in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, suffering scorn and shame.
The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where they stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.
A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-
brown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.MONK
God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall all perish in the black death. You, standing there like gaping cattle, you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may be your last hour? Death stands right behind you. I can see how his crown gleams in the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it above your heads. Which one of you shall he strike first? You there, who stand staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, woman, who bloom with life and self-
satisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning dawns? You back
there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse? Do you know, you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next day, because all of you have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do you hear the word? You have been sentenced, sentenced!The MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful
glance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face
upwards.MONK
Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of your son, Jesus Christ.He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a
strong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing and moaning.The procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the squire drinks his beer.JONS This damned ranting about doom. Is that food for the minds of modern people? Do they really expect us to take them seriously?The KNIGHT grins tiredly.JONS Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me to point out that I've either read, heard or experienced most of the tales which we people tell each other.KNIGHT (yawns) Yes, yes.
JONS Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --
all these I've accepted without too much emotion.He leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.JONS (contentedly)
My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying.The beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him like a shadow.In the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He stops JONS with a roar.JONS What are you screaming about?PLOG I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire Jns.JONS That's possible.PLOG Have you seen my wife?
JONS No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd seen her.PLOG
Well, in that case you haven't seen her.JONS Maybe she's run off.PLOG Do you know anything?
JONS I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you.The smith sighs sadly and goes inside.The inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns
on an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays
piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and
perspiration.
MERCHANT
Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along the west coast. People are dying like flies. Usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole stock unsold.WOMAN They speak of the judgment day. And all these omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf's head.OLD MAN The day of judgment. Imagine.FARMER
It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely lose our crops.MERCHANT
And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go.OLD MAN The day of judgment. Just think, just think!FARMER If it's as they say, I suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can.WOMAN But there have been other things too, such things that can't even be spoken of. (whispers)
Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that's why she must cleanse herself.OLD MAN Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. I imagine they'll come on judgment night, at sundown.WOMAN There are many who have purged themselves with
fire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell.
MERCHANT This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out
loud, but all of us know that it's the end. And people are going mad from fear.FARMER
So you're afraid too.MERCHANT
Of course I'm afraid.OLD MAN The judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.They whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.PLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still dressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, his face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table.RAVAL Do you want this armlet? You can have it cheap.JOF I can't afford it.RAVAL It's real silver.JOF It's nice. But it's surely too expensive for me.PLOG Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife?JOF Has she disappeared?PLOG They say she's run away.JOF Has she deserted you?PLOG With an actor.JOF An actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I think you should let her go.PLOG You're right. My first thought, of course, was to kill her.JOF Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do.PLOG I'm also going to kill the actor.JOF The actor?PLOG Of course, the one she eloped with.JOF What has he done to deserve that?PLOG Are you stupid?
JOF The actor! Now I understand. There are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor.PLOG You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre.JOF And that turned out to be her misfortune.PLOG Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. Isn't that true?Now RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil.
RAVAL Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the smith.JOF I! A liar!
RAVAL You're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with Plog's old lady.PLOG Are you an actor too?JOF An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that!RAVAL We ought to kill you; it's only logical.JOF (laughs)
You're really funny.RAVAL How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you anything on your conscience?JOF You're funny. Don't you think he's funny? (to Plog)
Oh, you don't.RAVAL Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind.PLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.
PLOG (shouting)
What have you done with my wife?The room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to escape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers.JOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as if the truth had just become apparent to him.
JOF Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked someone, or got in the way? I'll leave right now and never come back.JOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense.
RAVAL Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder.Trembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a word comes out.
RAVAL Stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are.JOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so
that he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one hand.PLOG (shouts) What have you done with my wife?PLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over
him.
RAVAL Don't lie there moaning. Get up and dance.JOF I don't want to. I can't.RAVEL Show us how you imitate a bear.JOF I can't play a bear.RAVAL Let's see if you can't after all.RAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.
Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs were about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him.RAVEL Up again! Be a good bear.JOF I haven't done any harm. I haven't got the strength to play a bear any more.At that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals
out. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at each other.JONS Do you remember what I was going to do to you if we met again?RAVAL steps back without speaking.JONS I'm a man who keeps his word.JONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers towards the wall.The hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and
the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.
The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms. They play together and laugh happily.Now, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea.Not far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He lifts his head.The evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child. The KNIGHT gets up.MIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the KNIGHT.KNIGHT What's his name?MIA Mikael.KNIGHT How old is he?MIA Oh, he'll soon be two.KNIGHT He's big for his age.MIA Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big.She puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.KNIGHT You played some kind of show this afternoon.MIA Did you think it was bad?KNIGHT You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming.MIA You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now.KNIGHT Is that your husband?MIA (laughs)
Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is Jof.
KNIGHT Oh, that one.MIA And now there's only him and me. We'll have to start doing tricks again and that's more trouble than it's worth.KNIGHT Do you do tricks also?MIA We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful juggler.KNIGHT Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?MIA Jof wants him to be.KNIGHT But you don't.MIA I don't know.
(smiling)
Perhaps he'll become a knight.KNIGHT Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either.MIA No, you don't look so happy.KNIGHT No.MIA Are you tired?KNIGHT Yes.MIA Why?
KNIGHT I have dull company.MIA Do you mean your squire?KNIGHT No, not him.MIA Who do you mean, then?KNIGHT Myself.MIA I understand.KNIGHT Do you, really?
MIA Yes, I understand rather well. I have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. Isn't that so?She nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass mound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her arms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like a child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?
What is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's
dirty, bloody face.
Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems unhurt.JOF Ouch, it hurts.MIA
Why did you have to go there? And of course you drank.MIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder than necessary.JOF Ouch! I didn't drink anything.MIA
Then I suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with. People don't like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies.JOF I swear to you that I didn't say a word about angels.MIA
You were, of course, busy singing and dancing. You can never stop being an actor. People also become angry at that, and you know it.JOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of MIA with an injured expression.JOF Look what I bought for you.MIA You couldn't afford it.JOF (angry)
But I got it anyhow.The armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her wrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each other, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and sighs.JOF Oh, how they beat me.MIA Why didn't you beat them back?JOF I only become frightened and angry. I never get a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know that. I roared like a lion.MIA
Were they frightened?JOF No, they just laughed.Their son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at MIKAEL.MIA Do you notice how good he smells?JOF And he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy one. A real acrobat's body.He lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, remembering the knight's presence.MIA Yes, this is my husband, Jof.JOF Good evening.KNIGHT Good evening.
JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one another silently.
KNIGHT I have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you.JOF Yes, he's fine.
They become silent again.
JOF Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia?KNIGHT Thank you, I don't want anything.MIA (housewifely)
I picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow ...JOF ... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor.MIA Please be seated and I'll bring the food.They sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL.KNIGHT Where are you going next?JOF Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore.KNIGHT I wouldn't advise you to go there.JOF Why not, if I may ask?KNIGHT The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.JOF Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard.KNIGHT May I suggest ... (JOF looks at him, surprised)
... that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east coast. You'll probably be safer there.MIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon.JOF I wish you good appetite.KNIGHT I humbly thank you.MIA These are wild strawberries from the forest. I have never seen such large ones. They grow up there on the hillside. Notice how they smell!She points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering some profound thought. JOF eats heartily.JOF Your suggestion is good, but I must think it over.MIA It might be wise to have company going through the forest. It's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.JOF (staunchly)
Yes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I have become director of the whole company.MIA (mimics) After all, I have become director of the whole company.JONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA points with her spoon.MIA Do you want some strawberries?JOF This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, and let us be together.MIA (stretches herself) Oh, how nice this is.KNIGHT For a short while.
MIA Nearly always. One day is like another. There is nothing strange about that. The summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don't have to be cold. But spring is best of all.JOF I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps you'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre.He sprints towards the wagon.
MIA Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by your songs.JONS (politely) By all means. I write little songs myself. For example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet.The KNIGHT looks at him.JONS You'll not get to hear it either. There are persons here who don't appreciate my art and I don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive soul.JOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies down.KNIGHT People are troubled by so much.MIA It's always better when one is two. Have you no one of your own?KNIGHT Yes, I think I had someone.MIA And what is she doing now?KNIGHT I don't know.MIA You look so solemn. Was she your beloved?KNIGHT We were newly married and we played together. We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her eyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little ears. We went hunting together and at night we danced. The house was full of life ...MIA Do you want some more strawberries?KNIGHT (shakes his head)
Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.MIA I don't understand what you mean.KNIGHT Everything I've said seems meaningless and unreal while I sit here with you and your husband. How unimportant it all becomes suddenly.He takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several times. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.MIA Now you don't look so solemn.KNIGHT I shall remember this moment. The silence, the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,
your faces in the evening light. Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to remember what we have talked about. I'll carry this memory between my hands as carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.He turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray sky.KNIGHT And it will be an adequate sign -- it will be enough for me.He rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues to play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.The KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is quiet and deserted; the sea is still.DEATH I have been waiting for you.KNIGHT Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments. Because I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in retreat. It's your move.DEATH Why do you look so satisfied?KNIGHT That's my secret.
DEATH Of course. Now I take your knight.KNIGHT You did the right thing.DEATH Have you tricked me?
KNIGHT Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check!DEATH What are you laughing at?KNIGHT Don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead.DEATH You're rather arrogant.KNIGHT Our game amuses me.DEATH It's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed for time.KNIGHT I understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game. It takes time.DEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT smiles.DEATH Are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest? Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have a small son?KNIGHT Why do you ask?DEATH Oh, no reason at all.
The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.Immediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.
There is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their son, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing.JONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his hands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers.JONS God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith?PLOG Good evening.JONS Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness?PLOG Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a rabbit.JONS If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way.JONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down by his side.PLOG Are you married?
JONS I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count of all my wives any longer. But it's often that way when you're a traveling man.PLOG I can assure you that one wife is worse than a hundred, or else I've had worse luck than any poor wretch in this miserable world, which isn't impossible.JONS Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them. So, however you look at it, it's still best to kill them off while it's most amusing.
PLOG Women's nagging, the shrieking of children and wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the devil's aunt for a mother-in-law. And then, when one wants to sleep after a long day, there's a new song -- tears, whining and moans loud enough to wake the dead.JONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's voice.JONS Why don't you kiss me good night?PLOG (in the same way)
Why don't you sing a song for me?JONS Why don't you love me the way you did when we first met?PLOG Why don't you look at my new slip?JONS You only turn your back and snore.PLOG Oh hell!
JONS Oh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!
PLOG (furious) I'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in their chests with a small hammer, I'll tap their heads ever so lightly with a sledge.PLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of sorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.JONS
Look how he howls again.PLOG Maybe I love her.JONS So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor misguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is another word for lust, plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all kinds of other fooling around.PLOG
Yes, but it hurts anyway.JONS Of course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love. But you almost always get over it.PLOG
No, no, not me.JONS Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while. Love is as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats away at your strength, your independence, your morale, if you have any. If everything is imperfect in this imperfect world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.PLOG You're happy, you with your oily words, and, besides, you believe your own drivel.JONS Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one,

title: Fatal Vision
synopsis: Part One:On February 17, 1970, at 0340 hours, at the US Army base at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on a rainy night, Captain Jeffrey R. MacDonald (Gary Cole), US Army Medical Corps, stumbles about in his on-base house. He makes a call for an ambulance and medics, and gives his address at 544 Castle Drive. He then says, They're dying! and I think I'm gonna die and drops the phone. Then he goes to a bathroom mirror, where there is an abrasion on his forehead, made by a blunt instrument. He is clad in only pajama bottoms, his whole face and chest is covered in blood and he also has what appears to be a stab wound on his right side. Then he goes to the kitchen and picks up the phone again, giving the same message saying stabbing..., before he drops that phone, too.A small group of military policemen arrive at the house shortly thereafter. Upon entering the back door of the darkened house, they express shock at the sight of two adults lying on the bedroom floor: Captain Jeffrey MacDonald and his wife Colette (Wendy Schaal). They then realize that MacDonald is alive. There are two young girls in their respective bedrooms, both dead, and the walls splattered with blood. The ambulance arrives, and its crew take MacDonald to the post hospital. Sadly, the MP's make a major mistake as they carry MacDonald out: they accidentally knock over a potted plant, then stand it back up.The chief investigator, Captain William Ivory (Scott Paulin), arrives. The MPs show him what remains, and the evidence, including the bloody word PIG on the headboard in the master bedroom.In the hospital, MacDonald calls out for news of his family. Ivory struggles to secure the scene and interview witnesses. Meanwhile, the doctor at the hospital phones Colette's parents, stepfather Alfred Freddy Kassab (Karl Malden) and his wife Mildred (Eva Marie Saint).Next morning, more medics remove the bodies of Collette and daughters Kristen (Dylan Galer) and Kimberly (Brandy Gold). One of the medics seals MacDonald's wallet from the house. Captain Ivory and his men find more evidence, including blue pajama-top threads in the master bedroom. Another investigator recovers the pajama top and finds a bunch of neat punctures in it. At the hospital, the pathologist tells Ivory that he has found a blond hair in Colette's hand, and a piece of skin under one of her fingernails.The Kassabs arrive at the hospital, followed MacDonald's mother Perry (Paddi Edwards). A sobbing MacDonald tells all of them the same story: intruders broke into his house killed his family and he couldn't protect them.The local police start rounding up suspects that fit the profile of the intruders that MacDonald gave the MPs: three hippie bearded men (two white men and one black man wearing a Army sergeant's jacket) and a woman in boots, long blond hair, a big floppy hat, and holding a candle. Jay MacDonald (Rex Ryon) gives a statement to the press in support of his brother Jeff. And, of course, the Army holds a triple funeral for Colette and the girls. MacDonald attends the funeral and openly weeps for his dead wife and two children.Several days later, Bill Ivory talks to a technician who finds inconsistencies: no threads, no blood, no splinters from a wooden club in the living room (where MacDonald is supposed to have fought the intruders off), but splinters and threads in the bedroom. Sadly, a piece of rubber glove, also recovered at the scene, has been misplaced and lost along with the skin sample taken from the dead Colette's fingernail.Freddy and Mildred mourn for their daughter and granddaughters. Next day, Freddy drives along Castle Drive and looks at the house. In a flashback to the spring of 1969, he remembers driving Colette and the girls to the house shortly after Jeff's arrival. When they go in, they find the house unfurnished. Though Freddy suggests they stay at a motel, Jeff insists that the family stay in the house, in sleeping bags. At the end of the flashback, an MP tells Freddy to move on.Another week later, Bill Ivory has to admit to the Provost Marshal (Jack Rader) that he has no evidence, no suspects, and nothing to suggest anything except a repeat of the murders of Sharon Tate and her house party in California, the previous year. Meanwhile, Freddy Kassab worries that four murderers are on the loose, and the Army can't seem to find them.Six weeks after the three murders (April 1970), MacDonald goes to see his commanding officer, Colonel Franz Grebner (Barry Corbin) of the CID about getting his furniture out of the house. But Grebner has another agenda. He introduces Ivory and Robert Shaw (Andy Wood), the two CID investigators. Grebner starts a recording and takes a statement from Jeff, beginning with observing that he was inducted into the army in July of 1969--and then giving him the Miranda Warnings.The story Captain MacDonald tells is this:On that evening, his wife went to bed first, and MacDonald stayed up late to watch The Tonight Show. At 0200 hours, he went to bed, but found that Kristen had crawled into bed with Colette and wet the bed. So he put Kristen to bed and slept on the couch in the living room. Some hours later, MacDonald wakes up to screams: Kimberly yelling, Daddy! Daddy! and Colette yelling, Jeff! Jeff! Why are they doing this to me? He also remembers as he got up off the living room couch, three rugged men suddenly appeared in the living room trying to club him. Two men were white and one was black and the black man was wearing a US Army jacket with the sergeants strips on one sleeve. Before Jeff could react, one of them punched him in the gut, and another one of them raised a bladed weapon. He describes also a girl with blonde hair standing nearby in a big floppy hat, holding a lighted candle, wearing a raincoat and high-heeled boots, and saying, Acid is groovy! Kill the pig! Then he remembers being in the hallway, with his pajama top wrapped around his arms. He received a blow to the head and passed out. When he regained consciousness, the four intruders were gone. He went to the bedroom and found his wife lying on the floor, with a knife sunk into her chest. That is all he remembers, except for a lot of blood on Colette and the girls. Vital signs, according to MacDonald, were all negative.Briefly and silently stunned by the story, Grebner starts questioning MacDonald more closely, but MacDonald doesn't quite answer the questions, preferring instead to reinforce his own account. The location of Jeff's pajama top especially puzzles Grebner. Getting more nervous and agitated, MacDonald embellishes his account about where his pajama top was first by saying it was pulled off and over his head during the struggle, then adding that it was around his wrists while fighting one of the intruders. Jeff makes a few slips about the details of the living room scene and then corrects himself by adding statements like: I forgot to say that, etc. He then mentions the puncture wounds on his abdomen.Then Bill Ivory strikes the first sour note. He casually suggests that MacDonald wounded himself. MacDonald shrugs this off at first. Then Grebner observes that the three people were over-killed with multiple stab wounds, but MacDonald survived with only one serious stab wound among superficial cuts and lacerations. Grebner and Ivory also notice that the screams came from Colette and Kristen, while MacDonald was lying on the couch. So it might be possible that there may have been two more intruders involved... intruders that MacDonald never described? How could six people crowd into a house that size? Why didn't the house, walls, and furniture sustain more damage? MacDonald again shrugs and states that he doesn't know. Then Grebner comes out and says it: Jeff MacDonald's story doesn't ring true. Grebner shows MacDonald photographs taken of the inside of the house taken on the day after the murders and proclaims: I've seen living rooms where all-night poker parties took place that caused more damage. In addition to the relative lack of damage to the inside of the house and the living room, the flower pot (which the MP's knocked over and stood back up) is standing up, and the living room coffee table is leaning over on its side. Grebner remarks that the table is top-heavy, and it should have landed upside down. The table was very likely and gently turned on its side. Conclusion: MacDonald staged the scene after killing his wife and two daughters himself. MacDonald suddenly stands up from his chair and reacts in anger and outrage at them implying that he killed his wife and kids in cold blood for no reason, but Grebner repeats that such things have happened before. MacDonald strongly denies killing his wife and two children and then accuses Grebner of picking him for a scapegoat just to close the case. However, Ivory, Shaw, and Grebner are all unsympathetic. They point out that experience says that the crime scene is inconsistent with MacDonald's story. The discussion, of course, goes nowhere as MacDonald basically pleads how much he loved his family and couldn't have done it. Grebner also has other evidence, however: he shows Jeff photos of two other women in MacDonald's life. Grebner openly speculates that MacDonald may have cheated on his wife with the two women and that Collette found out and it led to a fight which resulted in MacDonald killing her and his two daughters on a spur-of-the-moment rage. MacDonald admits to knowing the two women while he was working at a military hospital, but denies having any sexual relations with any of them. Jeff MacDonald then calmly and arrogantly says, You're more thorough than I thought.A few days later, Freddy Kassab thinks the Army is stupid for suspecting Jeff of the murders, and so does Mildred. Freddy is determined to fight for Jeff as hard as he can. Perry MacDonald travels to Philadelphia and calls in a civilian lawyer named Bernie Siegel (Barry Newman) to represent her son. He asks the usual defense lawyer questions before he takes Jeff's case. Siegel agrees to talk to Jeff after talking to Perry.Mildred places roses on Colette's grave as the voice of Jeff narrates a letter to the Kassabs, giving his impression (negative) of the investigation. In further scenes, Jeff takes a Rorschach inkblot test, then a polygraph lie detector test, and then what might be a Thematic Apperception Test (though this is not shown clearly). Bernie Siegel and his assistant Dennis Eisman (Lance Rosen) are confident in their case. Freddy tells the press how angry he is with the U.S. Army for holding Jeff.Days later, Freddy comes home to hear from Mildred that the Army will charge Jeff with three counts of murder in the deaths of Colette and the girls. Freddy pledges his support. But Mildred takes down a picture and has her own reminiscence:In Mildred's flashback, she is playing with Kimberly (Judith Barsi as Kimberly, age 3) in their home in Chicago back in 1967. The pregnant Colette ruefully observes that Jeff's medical-school schedule keeps him busy. Later, of course, Colette goes into labor and is admitted to Lakeside East Hospital, to bear Kristen. He is almost obsessively solicitous of Colette. Kimberly stays with Mildred at the house while Colette recovers. There she receives the joyous news that she has another granddaughter. But the next day, Jeff insists that Colette had been nearly neglected in the hospital. (Whether that was true or not, the show never makes clear.)Back in the present, Freddy tells Mildred that he's spoken to Jeff. Freddy reveals that the Army wants hair samples from every part of his body, to try to match it to the hair strand that Colette was grasping when she died. Freddy is still frustrated with Jeff for not telling him any details of the crime. So Freddy offers a $5,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of the intruders who killed his stepdaughter and two granddaughters.On May 1, 1970, the US Army holds an Article 32 hearing in Jeff's case. Character witnesses, including the Army psychiatrist, testify in support of Jeff. Freddy is frustrated with the Army for closing the hearing to the public. But Jeff boasts to Freddy about how Siegel showed that the MPs had not adequately secured the scene or the evidence. Freddy asks Jeff to get a daily transcript of the hearing. Jeff vaguely promises to try to get one.Jeff gives an interview to the Long Island Register and gives a lot of details that he never gave Freddy. That is the first thing that puzzles Freddy about Jeff's casual attitude. Mildred mourns that her granddaughters will never see something as simple as two blue jays feeding from a bird feeder.Days later, the Army investigators create an incident when they take Jeff into custody to take hair samples. In the process, Jeff, for no clear reason, kicks one of the investigators in his leg. As a result, one investigator manhandles Dennis in front of Bernie, who then goes on a rampage, yelling at anyone in sight, Now you know how the Army operates! Naturally that provokes Jeff to write another letter to Freddy at how he is being treated, and apparently a letter to newspaper columnist Jack Anderson.A few weeks later, a private investigator named William Posey (Joe Mays) tells Siegal and Eisman that he found a hippie woman named Helena Stoeckley (Alexandra Johnson), who wears high-heeled boots, a blond wig, and a big floppy hat. But after February 17, she never wore those items again. Instead she went about in mourning, hung a funeral wreath on her door, and placed votive candles all over her apartment. Posey even quotes Stoeckley as saying, We can't get married until we go out and kill some more people.Bill Ivory goes to see Helena Stoeckley first to question her about the MacDonald case. He gets little out of her, because she won't let him take notes. She admits just one thing: that she takes a lot of drugs (including marijuana), and never can keep straight what she does from week to week, let alone that far back in time. Helena claims that the blond wig she had was borrowed; the floppy hat she gave away; the boots she threw away; she denies having anything to do with witchcraft. Helena says that she will not get involved, and more to the point, says, I wasn't there.At the Article 32 hearing, Bernie Siegal has a field day with Ivory, showing that Stoeckley was anything but frank, candid, and open as Ivory tried to say.Next, Freddy Kassab testifies at the Article 32 hearing and gives more character testimony, including that if he had another daughter, he'd be happy to have Jeff marry her, too.Now Jeff testifies, describing in a proud tone about his clubs and sports teams in school, scholarship at Princeton University, medical training, and decision to join the U.S. Army. Then he re-tells this story of the night of the deaths:At 1815 hours on the night of February 16, Colette left for a night class. Then he put away some dishes from dinner in the kitchen sink, and stayed up with the two girls as they watched TV. He put Kristen to bed and fell asleep in the living room with Kimberly until Colette got back at 2100 hours. When Colette does come back, he proposes a nightcap. They sit in the living room for a while, and Jeff tells Colette that he's still working on going to Russia with the Army boxing team. Colette went to bed, and Jeff watched more TV and washed the dishes, wearing rubber gloves. He finished reading a novel at about 0200. Then he found Kristen on his side of the bed, which was wet, and put her to bed. He went to sleep on the couch, and then came the screams, the fight with the three hippie-looking men, and all the rest that he earlier had told Franz Grebner. The pajama top comes up, and he can't remember how it came to be wrapped around his arms in front of him. He remembers dropping the pajama top, but doesn't know where. He pulled a knife out of his wife's chest and tried to resuscitate her without success. Then he picked up the pajama top and covered her chest and face with it.The Army has two old knives that were found at the crime scene (a bent one beside the dead Colette and the other one outside the back door), which Jeff denies recognizing. An ice pick is introduced as another murder weapon. Again, Jeff denies ever seeing it before. Jeff also says that some of his drug-rehab patients threatened him with death in the course of his treatment of him.On October 13, 1970, the Army decides to drop the case with lack of evidence. Jeff is writing letters to a publicity agent when he is ushered into the office of the Provost Marshal, who tells Jeff that Colonel Rock has recommended dropping all charges. Afterwords, Jeff MacDonald resigns from the US Army and receives an honorable discharge.Freddy and Mildred are ecstatic about Jeff being cleared, but Freddy still wants a copy of the transcript of the Article 32 hearing. Jeff is far more interested in talking to reporters--including reporter Betsy Gilmore, who openly flirts with him over the telephone, a thing he's interested in. 'Look' magazine gets interested, and a interview is granted with both Jeff and Freddy. During the interview, Freddy says that he still wants to find the real killers by now. Freddy contacts a set of reporters to investigate the case, but Jeff wants the investigating paper to pay him. That's the second thing that puzzles Freddy. Jeff also tells Freddy that the Army has instructed him not to give him a transcript of the hearing, a thing Freddy won't accept.In December 1970, Jeff appears on a TV talk show, he tells the interviewer Dick Cavet (Billy James) about his interrogation, and that he had 23 stab wounds, some life-threatening, and then needed surgery. Watching the interview, Freddy knows that's false, because he remembers Jeff's hospitalization and nothing like that ever happened during it.At the CID, Colonel Pruett (Carmen Argenziano) summons Major Peter Kearns (Dennis Redfield) to reopen the investigation. Jeff MacDonald has made the Army resent him with his salacious interview. Col. Pruett's investigators find Helena Stoeckley, now living in Nashville. She then for the first time tells the Army that Jeff may have did the deed himself.Some time later, Freddy finally gets a copy of the Article 32 transcript. That makes him even angrier when he finds even more inconsistencies in Jeff's story:* Whom was Colette shouting to (Jeff, why are they doing this to me?), if Jeff was in the living room, she in the bedroom, and the four intruders were fighting with him there? And how could she talk at all?* Jeff was knocked back on the couch by the intruders and blacked out. Why didn't they finish him off?* Jeff heard Kimmie screaming, Daddy! But her skull was crushed by then, wasn't it?* Why was there no blood on the living room floor, where he fought the intruders?* Jeff never washed a dish in his life, with or without rubber gloves.* Jeff used a kitchen phone to call for help. But there was no blood on that phone.In summary: Jeff made 123 statements during the hearing that Freddy knows are false, or impossible to believe. Now, for the first time, he believes that Jeff might have done the deed.Meanwhile, Jeff MacDonald moves out to California, where he has signed on to a civilian hospital as an emergency-room physician. Perry MacDonald sees him off.Part Two:In March 1971, Freddy Kassab drives up to the vacant MacDonald house on 544 Castle Drive in Fort Bragg, carrying the copy of the Article 32 transcript. With him are Colonel Pruett and Major Kearns. Freddy wants to determine whether any part of Jeff's testimony could have been correct. And Freddy concludes, after walking about the house and wrestling with memories, that they were not:* Threads from Jeff's pajamas were found underneath the bed and underneath Colette's body in the master bedroom. How did they get there? Is is possible that Jeff wrote the word. PIG himself?* Why would four murderers fleeing the scene of the crime throw their weapons under a bush just outside the back door?* Four Valentine's Day cards sent by Freddy and Mildred to Jeff and his family a few days before the murders still stand upright on the top of the china cupboard in a corner of the living room. Freddy demonstrates that by stomping his foot on the floor, the four cards would have fallen down in any fight.* Two minutes is not enough time for Jeff to have done all he said he did between the first call and the second.* Jeff could never describe accurately the four intruders who attacked him as he did during the hearing, because he never testified that he turned on any lights in the dark living room when he claimed to have first saw the three men who attacked him.In the meantime, Jeff writes that he now has a good career in Long Beach, California, has bought a cabin cruiser speedboat (which he names 'Recovery Room'), and has begun an affair with Randi Amato (Nadine Van der Velde), a secretary in a yacht dealership.Now convinced that Jeff MacDonald indeed killed his wife and two daughters, Freddy from this point onward, becomes determined to bring Jeff to trial for the three murders. Over the next several months, he gets impatient with the Justice Department for not pushing the investigation. He announces to Mildred that he will twist the arm of every Congressman in Washington if he has to.In December 1972, Mildred, alone again, looks at a Christmas picture of Jeff and his family, and remembers Christmas of 1969 with all of them together in Fort Bragg, when Jeff gave Kimberly a pony of her own. Mildred notices Colette looking unsettled and emotionally distant while watching Jeff help Kimberly ride on the pony. Mildred thinks that Colette is just distraught about announcing her latest pregnancy (Jeff MacDonald's reaction to this is never shown, but from her appearance it might be speculated that he did not react well due to another child on the way). Mildred, Freddy, Jeff, Colette and the two girls then go inside the house for more unwrapping of gifts. But later that day comes a sour note: Jeff asks some of his Army neighbors over for a drink, though the family is already fixing dinner. And then Mildred recalls another important thing: the MacDonalds did have an ice pick in their freezer.A few days later, Jeff and Freddy have an angry telephone conversation about (what else?) the investigation, and about allegations that Jeff had an affair with someone during the Article 32 hearing. (Freddy talked to the girl, who never named or appears on-camera.) Jeff insists that Freddy is hurting people with his crusade and tells him that he just wants to move on with his life. Freddy quietly says he will not stop until Jeff is brought to justice for killing his family. Jeff continues to deny killing his wife and two daughters. Freddy, refusing to believe Jeff anymore, hangs up.In 1973, Mildred finds Freddy in the local library, where he tells her that he has found out that he could file a citizen's complaint to force the Justice Department's head to bring Jeff to trial.Freddy and CID Captain Brian Murtaugh (Joel Polis) go to the Washington DC office of Federal District Attorney Victor Worheide (Andy Griffith) to discuss the case. Worheide is openly skeptical: they have no confession, no apparent motive, and no witnesses to MacDonald killing his wife and two daughters. But Murtaugh and Freddy insist on pressing the matter. Freddy's motive: justice for Colette and the girls.Worheide visits FBI forensic specialist Paul Stombaugh (Mitch Ryan), with Freddy and Murtaugh in tow. Stombaugh tells them that the pajama top's damage is not consistent with someone stabbing at it with an ice pick while it was moving. It should have been torn, but it wasn't. But the pajama top's 48 holes, all clean, exactly match the 21 ice pick wounds on her body. And: Colette's blood was on the pajama top, in a perfect pattern, before it ever got torn. Conclusion: Collette was stabbed with the ice pick while the pajama top was laying over her.Meanwhile, Jeff has made a lot of friends in Long Beach, especially among police officers when he treats their buddies who are wounded in the line of duty. They and the nursing staff support him completely as he knows he must go back East to face a grand jury.In July 1974, at the grand jury hearing in North Carolina, Worheide presses the point with witnesses who say that the MacDonalds did have an ice pick in the house, and that no user of LSD would ever say, Acid is groovy. Nor could four persons using LSD organize anything as elaborate as a home-invasion murder. Jeff comes in for more embarrassment, because he has a copy of Esquire magazine. Worheide lets into evidence the February 1970 copy of Esquire which described the August 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders committed by the Charles Manson cult. Jeff also refuses a sodium amytal exam, and breaks down in the middle of the doctor's note recommending against it.Worheide also has Colette's body exhumed, long enough to recover blonde hair samples from her body to test against the hair recovered from her hand. Stombaugh later concludes that the hair belonged to Colette herself, not to any woman in a big floppy hat. MacDonald then has a field day with Colette being exhumed without his permission or even his knowledge.Another witness at the grand jury hearing, a local psychiatrist, describes that Jeff MacDonald may have a paranoid-type psychosis, in which the patient is convinced that his version of facts is the only possible one, any evidence to the contrary not withstanding. This is to show that Jeff's attitude shows all the signs of a paranoid-like syndrome. He testifies that Jeff MacDonald may have a narcissistic-paranoid mental disorder where he really believes his own lies (which is why Jeff was able to pass a lie detector test) and that he might have killed his wife and two daughters during an amphetamine rage.Jay MacDonald testifies that his brother is getting a raw deal, and Jeff protests that the government is harassing his family. Still, Worheide draws from Jeff an admission that he collected a lot of medical supplies while working at US Army hospitals in Fort Bragg and elsewhere, including Escatrol diet pills (or speed) which were found in his house on the morning after the murders.At another private strategy session, Murtaugh wants to make something of extramarital affairs that Jeff MacDonald had during his marriage. Worheide dismisses that as inconsequential and non-probative and that since Colette may have never known about it, showing any proof in open court that Jeff was cheating on his wife would be thrown out as bias and hearsay. Worheide says that on the morning after the murders, MacDonald was tested at the military hospital for all kinds of drugs (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, PCP, Dexedrine, Thorazine, painkillers, alcohol, etc.). The results were all negative, but he was never tested for amphetamines.Then, Stombaugh reminds the group that all the members of the family had different blood types. Worheide leaves the room at this point, with Murtaugh in tow. But Freddy prevails on Stombaugh to narrate the events. The blood types are as follows: Colette - type A, Jeff - type B, Kimberly - type AB, Kristen - type OAnd on that basis, Stombaugh produces this narrative:In a possible real flashback, an argument started in the master bedroom, between Jeff and Colette, possibly over Kristen wetting his side of the bed while sleeping there and Jeff having to sleep on the living room couch. Either Jeff or Collette slapped each other as the fight escalated. Colette then hit Jeff on his forehead with a hairbrush (found on the bedroom floor beside the bed), which was the result of his head concussion. Jeff hit her back with his fists. She tore at his pajama top with her fingernails. Colette found a small knife from her nightstand and tried to defend herself with it, stabbing Jeff to defend herself, making more cuts in the pajama top, stabbing his left arm and left side at least twice. Kimberly heard the struggle and got up and walked into the master bedroom. (That's when she cries, Daddy! Daddy! after seeing him hitting Collette and she apparently shoved him in outrage.) Jeff then picked up the wooden club, swung it at Collette, and may have hit Kimberly with it at least once on the head (possibly by accident), and he then hit Colette several times with the club until both of her arms were broken and her head bashed in. Shocked by his own actions, Jeff dropped the club, picked up the mortally Kimberly, and carried her to her own bedroom. After Jeff stumbled into the living room and cried over his actions, he got the idea of staging the scene after reading about the Tate-LaBiana murders in the Esquire magazine sometime earlier. So, he put on a pair of surgical rubber gloves and armed himself with an Old Hickory knife and the ice pick from the kitchen. In Kristen's room, he stabbed Kristen in the back and chest with the one of the knifes while she sleeps (intending to kill the potential witness). He then went back into Kimberly's room (who may have been already dead by this point) and clubbed her a second time, and stabbed her a few times with the same knife. Sometime during this, Colette regained consciousness and went into Kristen's room. Jeff found her there and beat her to death with the club, leaving her blood on the sheets and walls. In the master bedroom he collected the bedspread and sheet and carried her into the master bedroom. He left plenty of evidence for the investigators to find, including a bare footprint of Colette's blood. Then he found the wooden club and the knife. In a rage, he came back to Colette and struck her so hard he scraped the bedroom ceiling with the club at least once. He wrote PIG on the headboard with Colette's blood. He stabbed Kristen many times with the ice pick, and then he used the same ice pick to stab the dead Colette while she was draped in his pajama top. That explains the clean holes in it. Next he staged the living-room scene by turning the coffee table on its side, then went to the bathroom to wound himself with a scalpel. He wiped the weapons clean of fingerprints using a bathroom mat, threw them outside in the back yard, disposed of the scalpel used to wound himself and the surgical gloves (either in the trash or flushing them down the toilet) and then picked up a telephone to call for help at 0340 hours.The narrative, of course, upsets Freddy, and he weeps bitterly. But he wanted to know, and now he knows.Next scene: Jeff testifies, and displays the same hostile and cocky attitude as he did with the Army investigators back in 1970. But he offers no explanation for the evidence introduced.The grand jury takes a long time to decide, as Murtaugh tells Freddy over the telephone. Victor Worheide, furthermore, is ill with heart disease. Freddy is not satisfied, and won't be until the case goes to trial.On January 24, 1975, the grand jury does act. They return a true bill of indictment for murder all three murders. Three FBI men show up in Long Beach to arrest Jeff on the strength of that later that same day. The trial is set to start on August 18, but no trial takes place. On January 31, Bernie Siegel files an appeal for dismissal because Jeff did not receive a speedy trial. Jeff gets out on bail, and will stay free until his lawyers exhaust all recourse. Victor Worheide, meanwhile, dies in October 1975 from a sudden heart attack (off-camera). A few days later Brian Murtaugh, now employed at the Justice Department, breaks the news to Freddy in Chicago.In 1976, Jeff takes Randi over the ocean, in his cabin cruiser, to Hawaii for a vacation. There Siegel assures him that he had the indictment quashed. Freddy receives that news badly. He obtains a permit to carry a gun. A shocked Mildred begs him to appeal to courts, and not take the law into his own hands. Freddy decides to follow her advice and go to the courts himself. Mildred vows to endure more delays, anything but watch him become a murderer. Freddy sends out a spate of letters.In a jump forward to June 1979 in Long Beach, writer Joe McGinnis (Frank Dent) meets Jeff for the first time, after the Supreme Court has ordered Jeff brought to trial after all. Jeff's first interview with Joe strikes one critical sour note: Jeff wants to be cut in for a share of the take from any book project. In the next scene, the Long Beach Police Officers' Association gives Jeff a big fund-raising party.In Raleigh, North Carolina, Murtaugh introduces Freddy and Mildred to Federal prosecutor James Blackburn (Gary Grubbs), who admits he's never tried a murder before in his career. While in Raleigh, Freddy reminisces about Jeff mowing the Kassabs' lawn and shovel their driveway, and how Freddy used to drive Jeff and Colette to the movies.On July 16, 1979, after more then nine years of delays, Jeff MacDonald's murder trial begins in the Federal courthouse in downtown Raleigh. Judge Franklin Dupree (Albert Salmi) presides over the case. Blackburn and Murtaugh open their case by saying that MacDonald murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in a spur-of-the-moment of rage. Jeff's lawyer, Bernie Segal, argues that the case and evidence is old and that Jeff is the victim of circumstantial evidence brought by the government looking for a suspect. During the whole trial, Bernie's wide-open style of combative advocacy does not sit well with Judge Dupree and the two of them verbally clash repeatably during the whole trial.A few days later, the jury visits the crime scene (still vacant since the night of the murders). Jeff goes inside before the jury and tours the house with Bernie, Dennis, Joe McGinnis and their staff. When they emerge, a gaggle of gawkers gaze at him. Then the jury gets off a bus to inspect the crime scene themselves for twenty minutes. The children's furnishings and blood stains interest them the most. But afterwords, Jeff just wants to hit the track and the bar bells before dinner.Back in the courthouse, Stombaugh testifies and introduces the bloody footprints and the pajama top. Jeff still displays his hostile and cocky attitude while away from court to Joe while they are working out.Meanwhile, Freddy expresses fear that James Blackburn is not up to the aggressive standard of Victor Worheide. Mildred tells Freddy to trust Blackburn's judgment.At a birthday party for Bernie, Bernie's staff give Bernie a dartboard. They then mount a picture of Brian Murtaugh on the dartboard and take turns throwing darts at it. Jeff scores a bulls-eye.Bernie calls forensic expert named Dr. James Thornton (Roy London) to say that an ice pick could have made clean holes in a pajama top. But Brian Murtaugh, with Blackburn's help, demonstrates using a pajama top to defend against an ice pick. Murtaugh wraps a similar pajama top around his wrists while Blackburn stabs at it with the ice pick. Result: Murtaugh sustains a minor wound on his left hand, but also shows that the holes in the pajama top are jagged and torn, not smoothly cylindrical like the ones in MacDonald's pajama top.Between sessions, Bernie interviews Helena Stoeckley and tries to wring from her an admission that she was at the murder house. But Miss Stoeckley insists, politely at first and then angrily, that I wasn't there. I don't know what you're talking about. I wasn't THERE!!! (Her testimony is not shown on camera.)Next, Bernie urgently tries to prepare Jeff to take the stand in his own defense. He does not want Jeff to display any more hostility. He especially does not want Jeff to spout off at Blackborn as he did at Worheide during the Grand Jury hearing. Jeff suddenly loses his temper again roars at Bernie about Worheide, calling him a Nazi and that it's all Worheide's fault for at bringing this whole thing to trial.... quite forgetting that Worheide is dead. He also has some choice words for Bernie about the jury. But finally he calms down long enough to tell Bernie not to mention the pony he once gave the girls.Bernie examines Jeff on the witness stand, and leads him to describe his family in warm, loving, grieving terms. (The jury do not seem impressed by Jeff's Crocodile tears.) Then the ever-courteous Blackburn rises to cross-examine. He concentrates on the pajama top with all the clean, neat holes in it. He points out that Jeff received no wounds from any ice pick. He asks several questions of fact, based largely on Stombaugh's conclusions. Then Blackburn asks several questions of this sort: If the jury should find such-a-thing, have you an explanation for that? Jeff shrugs with indifference and in every case gives the same answer: No. Or, Making the very large assumption that the Army CID knows how to type blood... no. (During a break, Siegel tells Jeff that he is generally pleased with Jeff's performance and tells him to continue to keep cool.) At one point in Blackburn's suppose the jury should find examination, Bernie files an objection for argumentative examination.That night, Freddy and Mildred hold each other in bed as they know they must hold out for one more night.The next day, Blackburn makes his closing argument, laying out the government's evidence, and explaining why he said, If the jury should find this and that, can you explain it? The point: Jeff cannot explain it. Blackburn suggests that the fight started inadvertently and escalated. And Blackburn ends by observing that Colette's words, Jeff, why are THEY doing this to me? sounds awfully close to Jeff, why are YOU doing this to me?In his closing argument, Bernie tries to counter by reminding the jury where the burden of proof truly lies. Whether he is arguing for jury nullification is impossible to say. But in the process, Bernie makes the same mistake that he warned Jeff not to make: getting angry in open court.August 29, 1979. The case goes to the jury. After forty-two minutes, a package arrives from the Long Beach Police Officers' Association: a bulletproof vest. Jeff dons it, at Bernie's orders.Six hours later, the jury finally brings in a verdict:In the death of Colette: Guilty of murder in the second degree.In the death of Kimberly: Guilty of murder in the second degree.In the death of Kristen: Guilty of murder in the first degree.The jury had apparently believed the prosecution's case; Colette and Kimberly were killed by Jeffrey MacDonald on the spur of the moment without any planning or premeditation, but Kristen was killed with premeditation. Seated nearby, Freddy and Mildred are both relieved and satisfied that it's over. Jeff's family and friends seated nearby are shocked and upset over the verdict. A shocked Bernie asks the judge to poll the jury. This is done, and every juror present says the same thing: Guilty. Jeffrey MacDonald sits beside himself and slumps back emotionally defeated.An overlaid text in the freeze-frame stated that after the verdict, Jeff MacDonald was sentenced by Judge Dupree to the maximum and harshest sentence allowed under Federal government law; three consecutive life sentences (obviously to make sure that Jeff will never leave prison alive). The following year in July 1980, Jeff appealed the verdict and was freed on the grounds of being denied a speedy trial as well as judicial bias, which went from the local Federal court all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington DC. In March 1982, the appeal was denied, and Jeff was returned to prison and his license to practice medicine was revoked for good. He is serving his three consecutive life sentences in a Federal prison in Texas, and will be eligible for parole in 1991.(As of this writing in 2016, Jeffrey MacDonald continues to remain in prison and will probably do so for the rest of his life for the murders of his wife and two daughters... murders he continues to strongly deny committing).The final closes with old photographs of the real Jeffrey MacDonald which shows his induction into the U.S. Army, his wedding day, his high-school baseball picture, a picture of him in the church choir, a picture of him as a boy, and finally a baby picture. And that baby picture (his first picture wearing big-boy clothes), which holds during the end titles, shows that Jeffrey MacDonald was just as likely to be angry about not getting his own way even then.

title: Rock 'n' Roll High School
synopsis: The school board meets to welcome Miss Evelyn Togar (Mary Woronov), Vince Lombardi High School's new principal -- the old principal having been driven insane by the unruly students. Riff Randell (P.J. Soles) and her nerdy friend Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) hijack the PA system to play some music (Sheena Is a Punk Rocker). Miss Togar interupts the dance party and gives them both detention. Miss Togar then announces to the assembled students that Vince Lombardi High School has the worst academic standing in California. Three principals in a row have suffered nervous breakdowns because the student body cares about nothing but rock and roll music. Miss Togar vows to the students that she will clean up the school and make it a center of learning. Intimidated, the kids rush off to their classes.Kate has a crush on the quarterback, Tom Roberts (Vincent Van Patten), who has the hots for Riff. Tom is shy with girls -- all he can think of to talk about is the weather -- so rather than ask Riff out, he goes to see the school's fixer, Eaglebauer (Clint Howard), who has an office in the boys' restroom. Eaglebauer agrees to get Tom a date with Riff. His task becomes complicated the very next day when Kate asks him to get her a date with Tom.Riff, an aspiring singer and songwriter, has written a song called Rock 'n' Roll High School for her favorite band, the Ramones. Her heart belongs to lead singer Joey Ramone, and she hopes that one day she'll be able to give the song to Joey and that the band will record it.Miss Togar sends her two geek minions, hall monitors Fritz Hansel (Loren Lester) and Fritz Gretel (Daniel Davies), to summon Mr. McGree (Paul Bartel), the music teacher, and Coach Steroid (Alix Elias), the gym teacher, to the science lab. Togar has been researching the effects of rock music. She shares her findings with Mr. McGree and Coach Steroid, and performs a demonstration: Ramones music played at high decibel levels makes mice explode. Meanwhile the girls' gym class, left unsupervised, is rocking out to unauthorized music -- Riff singing along to her demo tape of Rock 'n' Roll High School. Fritz Hansel and Fritz Gretel happen by and rat the girls out, but before Togar arrives, the class goes back to the boring calisthenics they were supposed to be doing.In the girls' locker room, Riff announces that the Ramones are coming to town to give a concert and she plans to go. The other girls, though enthusiastic, can't take time away from school to wait in the ticket line for three days. Riff resolves to get tickets for everyone.At the concert hall, Riff is first in line. She sets up a folding lounge chair and settles in to wait. Back at school, Kate gives Miss Togar notes with increasingly implausible excuses to cover for Riff's absence: the death of her mother, the death of her father, and the death of her goldfish. (Hansel and Gretel disprove this excuse by producing the goldfish, which seems perfectly healthy until one of them swallows it.) The ticket line gets longer and a groupie, Angel Dust (Lynn Farrell), cuts in front of Riff to claim the first place in line. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of the Ramones in a big old convertible, singing I Just Want to Have Something to Do. The band's manager recognizes Angel Dust and invites her to come in with the band, much to Riff's chagrin.When the ticket window finally opens, Riff buys 100 tickets and later distributes them at school. Miss Togar gets wind of the concert and demands that Riff and Kate surrender their tickets. When they refuse, Togar lets the hall monitors take the tickets by force (body search!). Disheveled and despondent at the prospect of missing the concert, the girls retreat to Riff's house to do homework.Meanwhile, Eaglebauer is with Tom in Tom's tricked-out van, coaching him on how to ask Riff for a date. Tom calls just as Kate confesses to Riff that she thinks Tom will soon ask her (Kate) out. Kate is furious when Riff agrees to go out with Tom, but Riff assures her that she only accepted so she can fix up Tom and Kate.In Riff's car, Kate and Riff hear a DJ giving away a pair of Ramones tickets on the radio. Frantic to win the tickets, Riff pulls the car over and they pull a man out of a phone booth (the poor guy's proposing to his girlfriend) so they can use the phone. When they hear they've won, Riff calls Tom to break their date and the girls rush back to Riff's place to dress for the show.That evening, concert-goers file into the club, which is growing crowded. The kindly Mr. McGree attends out of curiosity, but his outdated idea of cool clubwear (a '50s-era beret and a '60s-era scarf) elicits some snickers. A large white mouse is denied admission -- the staff is afraid the music will cause him to explode -- until he produces a pair of noise-canceling headphones. An Indian chief in full feathered headdress is also attending.Riff and Kate are introduced on stage by the DJ who ran the ticket contest, Screamin' Steve Stevens (Don Steele). Offered the chance to say a few words to the crowd and the radio audience (which includes Miss Togar), Riff says On behalf of the students from Vince Lombardi High who are here tonight, I'd just like to say one thing: Screw you, Principal Togar, we made it to the concert anyway!Screamin' Steve tries to get Riff and Kate backstage to meet the band, but the Ramones' manager isn't having any, and tells Angel Dust, the groupie, to see the girls back to their seats. The crowd is revved up and shouting hey, ho! let's go! when the band takes the stage to open with Blitzkrieg Bop. Riff has to encourage Kate to get into it, but Kate begins to loosen up and enjoy herself during the next song, Teenage Lobotomy. During the following number, California Sun, Angel attempts to steal the song Riff wrote. Tom, who has come to the concert with Eaglebauer, chases her and gets hold of the package when Angel trips over a cokehead who's spilled his powder on the floor. Riff offhandedly thanks Tom for his help and runs back to the concert. Tom sees that only Kate really cares about him and they agree to be friends. Back on stage, Joey (reading a note from Riff) dedicates the next song, She's the One, to Tom and Kate.At the same time Miss Togar's minions, Hansel and Gretel, crash the concert looking for Riff. Instead they find Angel Dust in the Ramones' dressing room. When Angel Dust mouths off to them, they yell body search! and attack her. Riff eventually gets backstage to give Joey her song.A few days later, Miss Togar and several concerned parents hold a rally where they try to burn a pile of Ramones records in front of the school. Riff and Tom throw a bowl of water at the bonfire and at Miss Togar. When most of the students begin to riot, the Ramones arrive and all the students cheer for them. Taking over the group, Riff, Tom, Kate, Eaglebauer and others storm the school and throw a large climactic party. Mr. McGree, finally seeing the ruthless and authoritarian figure that Miss Togar has become, defects and joins the students -- and the party -- in the school. Hansel and Gretel sneak in to stop the party, but when they're discovered hiding in a laundry cart, the Ramones themselves push the cart out of a third floor window. Miss Togar's henchmen end up in bandages and casts with multiple injuries.During the party, Riff announces that the Ramones are honorary members of the student body. The Ramones give Riff a Ramones jacket and makes her an honorary member of their band. The band plays Do You Wanna Dance while Kate and Tom dance together and make out, having found love at last. The students proceed to party and wreck most of the building with the loud music.But that evening, a furious Miss Togar calls the police and the building is surrounded by riot officers led by Chief Klein (Dick Miller). When Miss Togar, speaking through a bullhorn, demands that the students stop the festivities, Riff responds by destroying all the mid-term exams and all the student records with a chainsaw. More angry than ever, Miss Togar and Chief Klein threaten to storm the building with tear gas unless the students exit the premises within five minutes.With few options left, Kate and Eaglebauer devise a bomb in the laboratory. Aware that their party is finally over, the Ramones, Riff, Kate, Tom, Eaglebauer, Mr. McGree, and all the students quietly file out of the building where the riot police are poised to attack. Riff steps forward and tells Miss Togar that if she wants to have her school back, she can. When a surprised Togar asks Riff what she would have done with the school anyway, Riff says Rock the roof off it! Hit it, Marky! -- and the band launches into Riff's song, Rock 'n' Roll High School. The students and Ramones resume their party and Riff detonates the bomb. The school explodes spectacularly.As Vince Lombardi High School burns, fire trucks arrive. The students are led away, still happy and partying, to police buses waiting to take them to jail, while Miss Togar is taken away in an ambulance in a straight-jacket mumbling detention over and over. She has become the latest principle to be carted away to a mental hospital.

title: Gattaca
synopsis: In the not-too-distant future, where genetic engineering of humans is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class, Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is conceived and born without the aid of this technology. Suffering from the nearly eradicated physical dysfunctions of myopia and a congenital heart defect, as well as being given a life expectancy of 30.2 years, Vincent faces extreme genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his life-long dream of becoming an astronaut is to break the law and impersonate a valid, a person with appropriate genetic advantage.[4]He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a former swimming star who, despite a genetic profile second to none, won only a silver medal in a high-profile competition. He then attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a car, but again fell short of his goal in that he only succeeded in paralyzing himself from the waist down. However, as the incident occurred outside the country, no one knows of his newly acquired disability. Thus, Vincent can buy his identity with no one the wiser. Though he requires orthopedic surgery to increase his height, persistant practice to favor his right hand instead of his left, and contact lenses to replace his glasses while matching Jerome's eyes, he can use his valid DNA in blood, tissue and urine samples to pass any genetic test - as long as he takes extreme measures to leave no traces of his identity as an in-valid. But, where he was once an object of scorn and pity, he is now a perpetrator of an unspeakable fraud. Legally, exposure would only subject him to fines, but socially the consequences would be far more extreme - he is now a heretic against the new order of genetic determinism. Vincent is now a borrowed ladder (a reference to the ladder structure of an un-coiled DNA strand) or in harsher language, a de-gene-erate.With Jerome's impressive genetic profile he easily gains access to the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation (his interview consists entirely of a urine test), the most prestigious space-flight conglomerate of the day. With his own equally impressive determination, he quickly becomes the company's ace celestial navigator. But a week before Vincent is scheduled to leave for Saturn's moon Titan, the mission director is murdered, and evidence of Vincent's own in-valid DNA is found in the building in the form of an eyelash. The presence of this unexpected DNA attracts the attention of the police, and Vincent must evade ever-increasing security as his mission launch date approaches and he pursues a relationship with his co-worker Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman).After numerous close calls, the investigation eventually comes to a close as Director Josef (Adam S. Gottbetter) is arrested for the murder by the lead detective covering the investigation (Alan Arkin). The Director reveals that he murdered the mission director in order to buy time for the mission to launch, because the window of opportunity for the launch is only open once every seventy years, and that it is now too late to stop the launch. However, just as Vincent appears to be in the clear, he is confronted by one of the detectives, who is revealed as Vincent's estranged brother, Anton (Loren Dean). Anton tries to convince Vincent to go with him for protection before Vincent is found out. However, it soon becomes apparent that Anton is acting more out of insecurity and is more concerned with how Vincent had managed to get the better of him, despite his supposed genetic superiority. Vincent and Anton settle their competition as they did when they were children, by seeing who could swim out into the ocean farthest. As he did once before when they were young, Vincent manages to beat his brother, and, once again, saves him from drowning. This is simply because he refused to save any strength to swim back - he is willing to risk everything to succeed. Conversely his brother worried about preserving enough strength to swim out and return again, and these fears kept him from testing his true limits.Anton: Vincent! How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done any of this? We have to go back!Vincent: It's too late for that, we're closer to the other side.Anton: What other side? Do you want to drown us bothVincent: You want to know how I did it? This is how I did it, Anton. I never saved anything for the swim back.As the day of the launch finally arrives, Jerome bids Vincent farewell and says that he intends to travel too. He reveals that he has stored enough genetic samples to last Vincent two lifetimes. Overwhelmed and grateful, Vincent thanks Jerome for lending him the identity that has allowed his success at Gattaca. Jerome replies, however, that it is he who should be grateful, since Vincent lent Jerome his dreams. As Vincent moves through the Gattaca complex to the launch site, he is stopped for an unexpected DNA test. Vincent reluctantly agrees to take the test, even though he has none of Jerome's genetic material to hide his identity. The test result uncovers Vincent's in-valid status, and the doctor, Lamar (Xander Berkeley), reveals that he has known Vincent's true identity all along, saying: For future reference, right-handed men don't hold it with their left. Just one of those things. Lamar then alters the test result to allow him to proceed regardless, confessing that his son admires Vincent, and wants to be an astronaut just like him, despite an unforeseen genetic defect that would already rule him out. As the shuttle lifts off, Jerome is shown committing suicide inside his home incinerator, wearing his silver medal, which turns gold in the flames.The story centers on the irony of the perfect Jerome failing to succeed despite being given every advantage while the imperfect Vincent transcends his deficiencies through force of will and spirit. A milder version of the disorder that afflicts Vincent prevents Irene from taking part in space flight. This dichotomy shows how the eugenic policy in Gattaca and the world in which it is set adversely affect the humanity of both Vincent and Jerome, as well as the invalid and valid humans they represent. A coda, cut from the final film, lists various people who have succeeded despite genetic deficiencies (and would be excluded in the modern society of Gattaca), such as Albert Einstein and Abraham Lincoln.

title: The Brown Bunny
synopsis: The film opens with a motocross race shot from high above the racetrack. The racers careen around the track and the sound goes in and out as the racers get further from the camera. The camera focuses on one racer in particular, number 77, as he tries to keep up in the race. He is far from first, but is still in the race.As the race sequence draws to a close, we cut to racer #77, Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) as he puts his motorcycle into his van and catches his breath from the race. He loads the bike into his van and gets behind the wheel.He drives to a gas station, and we discover that we are in New Hampshire. He gets out to fill the tank, and we see him doing so through the window of the service station, where a young girl sits, presumably reading, behind the counter. He finishes pumping the gas and goes inside to pay. Bud notices her necklace and comments on it. The necklace says Violet on it, and she says that she made it herself. She asks him if he was in the race, and he says 'yes'. She then asks him where he's off to, and he says he's going to California for the next race on the circuit. She says that she's always wanted to see California, and he asks her to go with him. She agrees, and they head to her house so she can pack a bag to go.Outside her house, Bud and Violet they kiss and he tells her that he likes her very much. He tells her to hurry and she runs inside while he waits. After about a minute or so of waiting for her, he pulls away, without her. No explanation... he just drives away.Bud is on an interstate headed to California. Through the vantage point of two cameras we alternately see the road and Bud as he drives. Soon he has pulled off the road into a town. He drives through the town, eventually stopping at a house. He walks to the house and tells a middle aged woman who answers the door that he used to live next door, and that the woman's daughter, Daisy, lives with him in Los Angeles. The woman invites him in.Bud sits at the kitchen table with the woman and a man, presumably her husband, and they talk. He tells her that he's going back to California to see Daisy and that she (the mother) had been to visit them, but the woman does not remember Bud at all. She asks if he and Daisy have any children and he tells her that they don't. Next to the table is a brown colored rabbit in a cage. The woman says that it is Daisy's bunny, and Bud admires the bunny for several moments. Bud then says goodbye and gets back in his van and drives off.He drives a good deal more, with Gordon Lightfoot's song Beautiful playing over the shots of the road. He comes up on St. Louis and decides to get off the highway. He stops into a pet store and looks at the birds, the fish, he plays with a kitten and some puppies, finally leading him to the bunnies. He asks the clerk how long bunnies live for and the clerk tells him they only live for about five or six years. He takes a particular liking to a brown bunny, but does not take it with him. He just admires it for a little while.He stops into a restaurant, has some food, uses the bathroom, and then gets back on the road for more driving. He drives a little while and stops at a rest area. There is a woman (Cheryl Tiegs) seated at a picnic table near where Bud parks. She looks lonely. We see embroidered on her purse that her name is Lilly, and Bud walks past her to the Coca Cola machine. He buys a Coke, and she watches him the whole time. He walks past her to his van and she continues watching him. He stops before getting in his van and goes to sit next to her. He holds her face, lovingly, and tells her it's okay. They begin to kiss and they both cry while doing so. After kissing her for a bit, he gets back in his van, leaving her there.More driving. A lot more driving.During his drive, he thinks of a time when he and Daisy (Chloe Sevigny) were together in the van and he cries about this. His next stop is in Utah, where he gets a room in a seedy motel and has a shower. From there he heads out to the Bonneville salt flats where he takes his bike out of the van and races for a while. The shot follows him for seemingly five minutes until he is out of sight on the horizon. We then see him back in his van heading out from the salt flats.More driving.Bud arrives in Las Vegas. He drives for a bit, and at each corner, a woman approaches him asking him if he's looking for a date and he blows them all off. The third woman to approach his van has on a necklace that says Rose. (Note: all of the women's first names that Bud has picked up is named after a particular flower). He tells her he's not looking for a date, and pulls off. He then circles the block and comes back to her. He tells her that he wasn't looking for a date, and asks her if she'd like to have lunch with him. She says that she has to make her money and steps away from the van, but the next shot we see is of her in the van with Bud, eating french fries. They drive around for a bit, and Bud pulls down a side road. He gets out and tells her to get out the van. She does, and he presumably hands her some money, gets back in the van, and leaves her there.More driving, and finally Bud arrives in Los Angeles. Bud pulls into a garage where he's greeted by three mechanics who help him get the bike out of the van. The mechanics hook the bike up to a diagnositic system and check the bike out for him. One of them asks if he's heading to where the race is tonight, and he says that he's staying in L.A. for the night.He gets a room at a local Best Western and from the hotel he gets in his van and drives to Daisy's house. He parks the van in the driveway and goes to the front door. He rings the doorbell twice and knocks, but no one answers. A next door neighbor yells, there's nobody there! The neighbor threatens to call the police if Bud continues hanging around. Bud gets back in his van and seems to have given up, but he grabs a piece of paper and a pen and writes Daisy a note which he puts on the door, then heads back to the hotel.At the hotel, Bud calls the front desk and tells them that he's expecting a phone call or that a woman named Daisy will be looking for him, and he tells the front desk to let her up. He goes into the bathroom, and when he comes out, Daisy is standing by the door. She says hi to him and talks but he has no reaction to what she is saying. She says that she has to use the bathroom and goes in leaving him on the bed. In the bathroom she smokes crack, making no attempt to hide the fact that she is. She comes out and Bud is still sitting on the bed. She asks if she should go to the store to get something to drink and he says that he doesn't drink anymore. She asks if she can sit on his lap and hold him the way they used to. After asking him several times, he agrees and sits on his lap, holding him close. She gets up to get some water and says she has to use the bathroom again, that she Drank too much water before coming over. In the bathroom she takes three more hits off her pipe.She returns to the room and he's seated on the other side of the bed. She asks him why he's being so cold, and not talking, and he doesn't respond. He lies on the bed and she lies next to him and talks to him about how much she's missed him and how glad she is that he's back. They kiss a little, and then a lot more. He tells her to take off her shirt, and she is reluctant at first, asking him to turn off the lights, or if she can get under the covers and he says no. She takes her shirt off, and he removes her pants and her bra. He stands up, and undoes his belt.(Warning: I'm not going to go into too much detail, because, let's face it, it is what it is. We see his manhood, she does the deed A full blowjob. It's graphic, but much of it is focused on his face, or on a shot from behind them, so it's not the kind of coverage you would get in say... hardcore oral sex porn. While she is doing the deed, he asks her if she's done this to any other guys, or if she's fucked other guys, and she keeps denying that she did.)When he's done, he puts his piece away and collapses on the bed, crying, sobbing, saying: Why did you have to do it? She lays beside him and they jointly tell the following story, which we see in flashback....Apparently there was a party at the very same house where Bud looked for Daisy. Three guys at the party offered Daisy what she thought was weed, but was more probably crack. She smoked some and Bud yells at her, that she shouldn't have done that because she is pregnant. He said that because she smoked and drank that she lost the baby, and she says that she is an addict... she couldn't help it. Eventually, the alcohol and drugs made her pass out and the three men took her into a bedroom and raped her. As they raped her, Bud saw them doing so but did nothing to stop them. She asks him why he didn't stop them, but he doesn't answer. He just says that he left, he ran away, and when he came back later that night there was an ambulance there. He asks her why there was an ambulance, and she says that... she died. She tells Bud that she vomited while she was passed out and she choked on the vomit and she died. We see Bud kissing the dead Daisy's forehead in the ambulance in the flashback. When it comes back to the hotel room, Bud is on the bed by himself, sobbing. Daisy is nowhere to be seen.The next day, Bud is driving in his van to the race, and the film ends on a freeze frame of his face driving in the desert.

title: Sabotage
synopsis: First we see a dictionary page highlighting SABOTAGE, then a power station with one chimney smoking in the moonlight, then a gaudily lit London street at night. The lights in the streets go out. Lit only by flashlight, we see a large machine half in water. Several hands excitedly fuss with the machinery, digging up a muddy substance. A first voice says: Sand!, then another voice Sabotage!, and a third : Who did it? The face of Karl Verloc (Oscar Homolka), walking in the shadows, emerges to fill the screen.Customers at the BIJOU cinema exit to the street after the power goes off. Some loudly insist on getting a refund. At the box office, the clerk and the owner's wife are hesitant to refund anything, as they are short of cash.A youngish man Ted Spencer (John Loder) stands on a step and spouts off comically as though he knows the law and repeats there is no need to return money, as there is no fault by the cinemas owners.Meanwhile, Verloc comes into the BIJOU surreptitiously although Ted observes him. He quietly goes to bed at the dwelling in back of the screen and lies down as if he had been napping.Verloc's young wife Sylvia (Sylvia Sidney) is hesitant to give refunds, and believes her husband is still out, but Ted tells her he saw him come in, so she goes into the apartment, finds Verloc, and asks whether to refund the money. Verloc tells her to go ahead and give refunds, as he will be getting some money shortly.Just as refunds are about to be given, the power comes back on, customers laugh and reenter the BIJOU.The Verlocs are the owners of the BIJOU. They live, together with her little brother Stevie (Desmond Tester), in the rear apartment. Right after the blackout, the cook leaves, leaving Stevie in charge of finalizing dinner. Stevie fumbles and breaks a dish, which he hides in a drawer.Scotland Yard suspects Verloc is an agent for a foreign power, part of a gang planning other attacks. Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer was assigned to investigate Verloc under cover, and attempt to get hard evidence against him. Spencer poses as a greengrocer's helper, selling fruit and vegetables in a shop right next to the cinema. The family comes into the shop often, and he ingratiates himself with Stevie and his sister by providing many extra services.Ted is attracted to the beautiful Sylvia but she wants nothing to do with his advances.Ted invites Stevie and Sylvia to a full lunch at Simpson's, a fashionable restaurant. At the lunch, Sylvia explains that her husband is a good man who has been kind to her and her little brother.She is an American who came to London with Stevie to escape the Depression in America, but when the economy crashed in England, too, they were down on their luck and to survive she married a kind older man who protected them. They are running the BIJOU, but struggling economically.Verloc receives a phone call and goes to the London aquarium to receive pay and more instructions. He is tailed by police, who want to identify the entire saboteur gang, but knowing the foreign bosses are people you and I will never catch as one policeman tells another.Verloc meets his contact in front of an illuminated tank where a huge turtle is swimming. A passerby (Charles Hawtrey) enthusiastically describes the reproduction of fish at the aquarium and compares them to humans.Verloc is paid but scolded because his power station stunt was disappointing. London must not laugh is the order given to Verloc. We want the English to worry about what happens in England and thus pay no attention to what happens elsewhere in Europe. Agents must not fear retribution to earn their money.Then the contact assigns Verloc to put a bomb in Piccadilly Circus station the center of the world, and produce fear, not laughter. Verloc isn't a forceful villain, just a weak, man of no moral fiber who objects to the idea of murder but decides to go through with it for money.The bomb is to be prepared by an agent who runs a pet shop as a front. Verloc realizes that he is in over his head, and tries to get out of the fearsome responsibilities, but he is scolded again and he accepts.
In a dreamy sequence the scared Verloc sees the fish swimming in the tank and imagines them as motor cars filled with passengers moving around Piccadilly Circus when an explosion demolishes all buildings around. Suddenly the fish in the tank reappear.Again tailed by Scotland Yard, he proceeds to the pet shop. At the pet shop, an old biddy wants to return a canary that won't sing. The shop owner Professor Chatman (William Dewhurst), has no trouble getting the bird to warble, implying that it's the lady's fault. Verloc is led to a stuffy kitchen where a chaotic nconventional family of three, a father, daughter, and granddaughter live, to talk to Chatman.Chatman opens a cabinet, reaching for bomb making stuff and first finds the granddaughter's doll in the cabinet. He then explains to Verloc that the bomb is up to Chatman, only the delivery will be up to Verloc.They agree to disguise the bomb in a cage with canaries, addressed to Stevie, who will enjoy the birds.A clandestine meeting for gang members is arranged for Verloc's apartment. Ted has no difficulty identifying something is afoot, since anyone wanting to see Verloc must walk up to the front of the Bijou, pass into the dark screening room, walk along its side to a curtain next to the screen. Behind the curtain is Verloc's door.Ted gets Stevie to show him how to get behind the screen to a window from which he might overhear what is going on at the meeting Verloc is having with other shifty-eyed foreigners in ill-fitting suits. Unfortunately, he is spotted by the conspirators and pulled into the room.The conspirators end their meeting, telling Verloc the job is his alone. Verloc exits to talk to his neighbor the greengrocer, and elicits comments that confirm that Ted is a policeman under cover.Meantime Sylvia has become gradually more suspicious about Verloc's activities. However, she hesitates and delays.Professor Chatman sends Stevie a pair of canaries in a cage, with the package bomb concealed in a drawer underneath. Verloc reads a sealed message that the bomb is set to go off at 1:45. Ted admits he is a detective and detains Verloc asking him details over and over, pretending he has no suspicions of Verloc himself. Verloc, wanting an alibi for the time of the explosion, arranges for Stevie to take the package to Picadilly and leave it in the station cloakroom by 1:30. The excuse is that a film canister needs to be returned nearby. It must be walked over, because it is inflammable and it cant be carried on a bus.The heartbreakingly cheerful brother is carrying the bomb along with film canisters labeled Bartholomew the Strangler. Because the Lord Mayor's parade is on that day, Stevie is delayed by all manner of events. A street vendor pulls him out of a crowd in order to demonstrate a new toothpaste. He's stopped from crossing a street because the parade is marching by. He enjoys watching the parade. The parade has snarled traffic. When he gets on a bus the conductor ironically warns, Don't set fire to me or the other passengers. The bus keeps hitting red lights.There are many cuts between the oblivious Stevie, with a time bomb in a package under one arm while petting a fluffy puppy with his free hand and talking to an old lady, those big outdoor clocks whose arms get ever closer to 1:45, until the explosion.Ted receives orders to go to the explosion scene. When Stevie does not get back home for a meal, Sylvia starts to worry and ask questions, and learns the awful truth from Verloc.Verloc confesses his part in the sabotage, while standing near the model boat which she and her brother had made, then blames Spencer for Stevie's death, saying he prevented Verloc from delivering the bomb himself. Verloc suggests to Sylvia that they could have a child of their own, as if to compensate for her loss.Sylvia, deeply depressed and confused at the revelation, hears laughter from the audience. She wanders into the theater in shock, and sits to watch Who Killed Cock Robin, a 1935 Disney cartoon featuring a parody of Mae West. Momentarily, she laughs, but when the arrow is loosed and slays poor Cock Robin, the laughter on her face changes to an expression of agony and terror.Her eyes and expressions subtly convey an emotional cascade of stunned realization, immense sadness, and suppressed hysteria. She realizes what a monster her husband is.Sylvia explodes after sitting to dinner with Verloc. He orders his still shocked and dazed wife to a get a grip and get prepared to deny everything. He goes on to order her to scold the cook about the overcooked cabbage soup on the dinner table.Without dialogue, the camera shifts from her face, to Verloc's, to the food they are eating, to her hold on a carving knife, until they both rise, stare at each other, and it happens: she stabs him in the stomach with the knife.Meantime, Ted discovers, at the scene of the blown up bus, part of the film canister from the BIJOU that most likely was carried by Stevie, so he returns to the BIJOU.We see Sylvia sitting, dazed, right past the doorway, and in the foreground, the feet of the slain Verloc.When Spencer arrives at the apartment, he realizes what has happened, but insists that Sylvia shouldn't admit that she knifed her husband. He takes her out of the apartment and tries to convince her that he is in love with her, and talks about getting on a boat crossing the Channel to France and together escape the police.Professor Chatman's daughter berates him for leaving a bird-cage with the shop's identification at Verloc's, and insists he go back to retrieve it. Chatman enters the apartment just ahead of a squad of detectives coming for Verloc. When the detectives knock, he locks the door and announces he has a bomb and will blow it up if they enter.The detectives at the door assume they are hearing Verlocs voice, and take the threat seriously. They evacuate the building. They argue about who should stay near the apartment: the single guy says he will stay and let the married ones go to a safer place, but one of the marrieds jokes that since hes already married, his life is over anyway so he might as well stay.Sylvia is dazedly responding to Ted's love declaration, and kisses him, but she refuses to run away, and is just on the edge of confessing to a policeman when an explosion and fire at the cinema intervenes. The evidence of her crime is destroyed, and effectively prevents the policeman from remembering whether it was before or after the explosion that she said, My husband is dead!At the end we see Sylvia and Ted walk away together.

title: Let's Scare Jessica to Death
synopsis: Wearing just a nightgown, Jessica [Zohra Lambert] sits in a rowboat, staring at the water. I sit here, and I can't believe that it happened, she says to herself, and yet I have to believe it. Dreams or nightmares? Madness or sanity? I don't know which is which.Backing up a few weeks, Jessica has just been released from six months in a mental institution. In order to protect her from the stresses of NYC, husband Duncan [Garton Heyman] has given up his job as celloist for the New York
Philharmonic and purchased the old Bishop farm on Brookfield Island, Connecticut. When he, Jessica, and their hippy friend Woody [Kevin O'Connor] arrive at the tall, white, almost-gothic country home, they are surprised to find a
pale, mysterious, red-haired woman already living there. Her name is Emily [Mariclare Costello], and she is simply a drifter using the house because she thought it was abandoned, she tells them. When Emily offers to move on, however, Jessica invites her to have dinner with them and stay the night. Emily happily agrees. After dinner, Emily entertains on her lute while Duncan accompanies on his cello. Then, Emily engages Jessica in a seance to call up any spirits that might have died in the house. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), none show up.One night moves into more nights, and Emily continues to stay. It's becoming obvious that Woody is attracted to her, and Jessica doesn't mind having Emily around, especially because Jessica has begun hearing voices and seeing a blonde girl [Gretchen Corbett] looking at her and then disappearing. Another time, her leg was grabbed by someone under the water in the cove where she was swimming. Jessica is afraid to talk about these things with Duncan or Woody lest they think she's relapsing.Soon, Jessica becomes aware of other problems. 1) Duncan also appears to be attracted to Emily, 2) the men in town, all of whom are bandaged in some way or another, seem to be hostile towards them, and 3) money is tight. To get money for food, Duncan and Jessica decide to sell off some of the antiques they find around the farm. One of the items is a silver-framed portrait of the Bishop family -- father, mother, and daughter Abigail. Sam Dorker [Alan Manson], ex New Yorker and antique dealer, offers them $50 for the frame and tells them the story of how 20-year old Abigail Bishop drowned in 1880 just before her wedding day. Legend says that she's still alive, roving the island as a vampire. Jessica finds the story fascinating, but Duncan just wants to take the money and go home.After returning to the farm, Jessica and Duncan go for a walk around their property. Emily is sitting on the front porch playing her lute, and Woody is out spraying the apple trees. Jessica finds a mole and Duncan offers to take it back to the house and put it in a jar while Jessica stays in the graveyard to do some grave rubbings. She is just about to do a rubbing of Abigail Bishop's grave when she notices the blonde girl beckoning her to follow. The girl leads Jessica to a cliff, at the bottom of which lies Sam Dorker dead and bloodied. By the time Jessica finds Duncan, however, the body is gone. Did she really see it? The look on Duncan's face says that he thinks Jessica is going nuts again. Just then, Jessica notices the blonde girl standing on the cliff above them. Duncan sees her, too, and gives chase. He catches her, but when Jessica tries to ask her questions, the girl is either mute or won't talk. Suddenly, Emily walks up, and the girl runs off.That evening at dinner, it's obvious even to Woody that Duncan and Emily have eyes for each other. When Jessica retires early, Woody tells Duncan to take care of his wife. Reluctantly, Duncan goes up to their bedroom. Instead of taking care of his wife, however, he tells Jessica that she needs to return to New York to see her doctor again. Jessica becomes upset and tells Duncan that she wants to sleep apart tonight, so Duncan goes down to sleep on the couch where he is easily seduced by Emily.The next morning, Jessica finds the little mole has been repeatedly stabbed to death. Jessica denies doing it, but Duncan decides that it's time to get help for her and drives into town in search of a phone. While he's gone, Jessica goes up to the attic where she is surprised to come face to face with the silver-framed portrait of the Bishop family that they had sold just yesterday to Sam Dorker. When she takes a look at the three figures in the portait, she is astounded to see how closely Abigail Bishop resembles Emily. Is it possible they are one and the same?Suddenly, Jessica sees Emily coming up the stairs. Jessica tries to keep her cool while Emily denies that she is Abigail, all the while she is stroking Jessica's feverish face. Finally, out of a desire to get safely out of the attic, Jessica agrees to go with Emily for a cool swim in the lake, even though she's afraid of the water after being grabbed at the other day. As the two women sit at the end of the dock, Emily rubs suntan lotion on Jessica. Suddenly, Emily pushes Jessica into the water and jumps in after her. When Jessica panics, Emily apologizes for scaring her when all she wanted to do was have a little fun. Jessica wades towards shore and looks back to see that Emily has disappeared. She hears Emily's voice in her head and then sees her reddish-hair bobbing to the surface. When a pale white arm grabs her and tries to pull her underwater, Jessica fights to break loose and return to shore. She looks back at the water and watches Emily, pale and dressed in Abigail's wedding gown, rising slowly
from the water and walking towards her, all the while silently saying, Stay, Jessica, stay. Follow me.When Emily reaches Jessica and tries to bite her neck, Jessica's bravado returns. She runs back to the house, locks herself in her room, and waits for Duncan to return. Hours pass, during which Jessica can hear Emily's voice whispering to her. I'm still here... I won't go away... you can't get rid of me... I'm in your blood... you want to die. Come 5 PM and Duncan still hasn't returned, so Jessica changes out of her swimming suit and hitches a ride into town. While Jessica is on her way to town, Woody returns from working the fields to find that the only one at home is Emily. Although Woody doesn't like how Emily has been playing Duncan, he readily submits when she comes on to him. He gets a bite in the neck for his reward.When Jessica gets into town, she sees Duncan's car and asks about his whereabouts, but none of the men will admit to having seen him. Jessica notices that every man has cuts on his body and backs away... straight into the arms of Sam Dorker. Now totally confused about her own sanity, she runs back toward the farm. When she can run no more, she collapses on the ground and lies there until it turns dark and she hears Duncan calling her name. Duncan drives her the rest of the way home, and they go upstairs to bed. As they begin to kiss, Jessica notices a cut on Duncan's neck. Jessica tries to convince herself that it's only in her mind, but then she sees Emily brandishing a carving knife and leading the men from town. Jessica leaps from the bed and runs outside, knocking over Duncan's cello case to see the bloody body of a little girl come tumbling out.Jessica keeps on running. Along the way, she sees Woody's sprayer but when she gets closer, she sees Woody lying on the seat, his neck cut and bloody. She keeps on running. Around daybreak, she makes it to the ferry and tries to board, but the ferryman tells her, The ferry isn't running for you. Jessica jumps into a nearby rowboat and begins paddling out into the lake. Suddenly she sees a hand reach into the boat from the water. She stabs the person in the back several times with a long pick. As the body floats away, pale and bloody, she sees that it is Duncan. Back on the shore, Emily/Abigail and the men from town can be seen watching her.I sit here, and I can't believe that it happened, Jessica says to herself, and yet I have to believe it. Nightmares or dreams? Madness or sanity? I don't know which is which.[Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]

title: I Can Do Bad All by Myself
synopsis: The movie opens with a house number at the Indigo Club (Rock Steady by Aretha Franklin). Nightclub singer April (Taraji P. Henson) takes the stage with the microphone in one hand and a glass of liquor in the other.Although talented, it is clear April is troubled and heavily dependent upon liquor; and we soon discover why: April's personal life is in shambles. She is seeing a married man, Randy (Brian White), who announces he has child support problems, his wife is pregnant again and he basically detests kids. In addition, its clear Randy is very controlling but April has tolerated his controlling and abusive nature because he pays the bills.As April sings, we break away to Madeas (Tyler Perry) home. Madea has been awakened upstairs in the middle of the night to sounds of her downstairs window breaking. Madea goes to her brother Joe's (Tyler Perry again) room and tells him someone is breaking into the house. In a comic exchange, Joe begins to tell Madea she can handle the intruders and then remembers his weed is downstairs where the intruders are so he decides to help Madea by following her downstairs.Madea goes downstairs and discovers the intruders are three children: Jennifer (Hope Wilson), Manny (Kwesi Boakye) and Byron (Frederick Siglar). Although upset, Madea invites the children in to eat and discovers there are several problems. First, Jennifer is very angry and distrustful of people (important later), Manny is very friendly but very ill due to Diabetes and Byron doesn't speak (important later). Madea soon discovers the children are very hungry and theyve been alone for about a week. Their grandmother left one day and never returned. The children declare their mother has died and their next of kin is their Aunt April. Madea decides to take the children to their aunt, partially motivated by the desire to make sure they're taken care of and partially motivated by the desire to recover the sum of $300 for her broken window.Madea arrives at April's home with the children in tow. April sees the kids and freaks out, declaring she is not their mom and it is not her problem. Also, the presence of the kids would upset Randy who pays the bills but doesn't like children. Madea insists April handle this family responsibly. April takes the kids in but makes it clear they are not welcome. We soon discover April has no maternal instinct. She doesn't know how to comfort the kids who are distraught because their grandmother (Mama Rose) is missing. Madea leaves and April gets into a shouting match with Jennifer. Jennifer decides to leave but her siblings stay behind.Meanwhile, a young man named Sandino (Adam Rodriguez) approaches Pastor Brian (Marvin Winans) who is helping the needy on the front steps of the church in April's neighborhood. Sandino tells the minister he remembers Pastor Brian did some missionary work in his native country and now he is in America and is looking for a better life. Sandino says he wants to find work. Just as Pastor Brian is about to address Sandino's concerns, Jennifer runs toward the church steps at top speed. Apparently, she has stolen something and the shopkeeper is chasing her. Sandino catches Jennifer and Pastor Brian apologizes to the shopkeeper. Then, he instructs Miss Wilma (Gladys Knight), one of the church members to show Sandino around the church so he can do some handiwork. Subsequently, Pastor Brian takes Jennifer to her Aunt April's home.Pastor Brian explains Jennifer was caught shoplifting and April flips out. It turns out Jennifer was shoplifting needles for Mannys insulin shots. Although upset, April agrees to keep the kids until she finds her mother and the kids can go back to live with her.The Pastor then asks April to help out Sandino. April has a beautiful home she inherited but she refuses to fix it up (the house is also a metaphor for April's life: beautiful on the outside, but falling apart on the inside). The Pastor suggests that April allow Sandino to fix the walls and floors of the home in exchange for room and board. April reluctantly agrees.Sandino eventually moves in and April has two comedic requests: He must shave his long hair and he must lock himself in the basement at night. Sandino looks alarmed when April says she'll lock him in the basement because she doesn't know what kind of man he is. April suggests since hes a handyman, he should be handy at using tools to break out of the basement in case of a fire! Sandino reluctantly agrees to April's requests. He shaves and April discovers Sandino is strikingly handsome!The next few days are a period of transition for April's household and Randy is not happy. Randy, who has been coming over on a regular basis to sleep with April, discovers the kids are in the house. He flips out and shows how cruel and abusive he can be. He suggestively offers candy to Jennifer who refuses to take it. However, Jennifer's chubby mute brother, Byron, reaches for it and Randy almost breaks his arm. Then, Randy begins to insult Sandino by declaring Sandino must be illegal. Again, April tolerates Randy's mean-spirited, abusive behavior.Sandino proves himself to be a better man than Randy. He takes the high road and refuses to fight although Randy tries his best to corner Sandino. Where Randy is mean-spirited and cruel, Sandino is selfless and nurturing. When April complains the kids are keeping her up by playing soccer in the house (she sings at night and must sleep during the day), Sandino offers to take the kids outside and plays soccer with them. In addition, he buys insulin for Manny. Jennifer is suspicious and wants to know why Sandino is so kind to them. Sandino tells Jennifer she is doing a great job and she should expect good things in life. Jennifer disagrees saying she hasn't seen much kindness in the world but eventually, Jennifer softens up around Sandino.Eventually, a tragedy surfaces. Pastor Brian and Miss Wilma come by to visit April from the church. They reveal April's mom died and her body is at the county morgue. Apparently, April's mom was on a bus and had a Brain Aneurysm. No one noticed because it appeared she was sleeping on the bus. Her body was at the county morgue and when no one claimed her, she was cremated. Pastor Brian and Miss Wilma present April with an urn carrying her mother's ashes.April begins to sob uncontrollably and Sandino agrees with Pastor Brian that he should look after April. April goes upstairs to Randy who is sleeping in her bed. She climbs into bed crying and begins to hug Randy while he's sleeping in hope that he will wake up and comfort her about her mother passing. Randy wakes, briefly, only to shrug April off of him and scorn her. It is obvious that Randy couldn't care less about her. April rolls off the bed and goes down to the sofa, alone.As April sits on the sofa Sandino joins her and she reveals some of the history with her mom, whom April has had a love-hate, dysfunctional relationship with. When Jennifer was age 9, Jennifer's mom (also, April's sister) pimped Jennifer out for drugs. April and her mom had a fight a year ago over April helping care for the chidren after her sisters death and they stopped speaking thereafter. April tells Sandino her mom spent so much time caring for others, that she didn't care for herself hence why it is tragic that her mom died all alone on a bus. It is part of the reason why Jennifer is so mistrustful of people. April's mom came to the rescue again and again for the children. At that point, Sandino puts his arm around April's back and begins to comfort her. April begins to let down her guard but it is clear she is uncomfortable with Sandino so close due to her trust and self-esteem issues. They only break away when the kids come in. April asks where they've been and after Jennifer tells her they've been out looking for Mama Rose, she and Sandino break the news. The kids quickly move from denial and disbelief to an almost numb outlook on relationships. Jennifer tells Sandino they're fine and people die.Soon after, April's bartender girlfriend Tanya (Mary J. Blige) at the Indigo Club tells her, April is an alcoholic with self-esteem issues that is why she is tolerating a married, abusive man in her life. She tells her she is selfish and should be ashamed. Tanya goes on to sing the title number I Can Do Bad All By Myself, during which we see how who we come to understand to be Mama Rose seemingly fell asleep on the bus one morning, and never woke up. Later, April tries to tell Jennifer that even though she can't keep her, she'll find her a good foster home. Jennifer retorts with ending up like her Aunt April, selfish and only worried about herself since caring for others doesn't work out so well. April hangs her head and walks away out of shame and frustration.The next morning Sandino finds April in the kitchen, awake early fr her. He tells her not to sleep all day. Then Sandino takes April out for a paddleboat ride at the local park and tells her that he cares about her after she asks why he held her the way he did after she learned the fate of her mother. He tells her she's funny but hides her true and beautiful self behind a wall. He asks her why she puts up with Randy and if she loves him. April deflects a direct answer by saying Randy helps out and pays the bills. Sandino tells her that isn't love. He describes that love is having someone who will be there with you thick or thin, right or wrong. Whether she accepted what he said or not, she ends their paddleboat ride.Sandino has been fixing up a spare room in the house and shows the kids and April the room and for the first time, Byron speaks, my bed. Jennifer is notably upset asking him why he'd get their hopes up when April won't keep them. He tells her that April could change her mind. Jennifer forces her brothers to reject the room and April chastises Sandino for not giving her a heads up. He asks her why that matters when she'd obviously made it clear that she doesn't care about those kids.Sandino tries to wake up April for church that Sunday, only to be threatened with deportation by Randy who opens the bedroom door before April could wake up. Sandino goes to church without her. April wakes and gets dressed to go to church and Randy tries to stop her. She goes anyway, despite his protests.April finds her seat next to Sandino and the children. She takes heed to the message, especially the part when Pastor Brian describes the right person walking into one's life and bringing in a new light because they're worth waiting for. April pretends not to notice Sandino looking at her during that part of the sermon. Pastor Brian then sings a song to follow up his preaching, which breaks through April's tough cookie image and we see her reminiscing on pivotal moments of her recent experiences, good and bad. She sings along and Sandino is visibly supportive of her. Miss Wilma and Pastor Brian turn the song into a duet and finish off the church service.The drama within April's household comes to a head one night when Jennifer awakens to the sounds of Manny gasping for breath. Jennifer gets up and goes to the kitchen to prepare Manny's insulin injection. Jennifer is startled by Randy who is sitting in a chair smoking a cigarette in the dark. Randy begins to make sexually suggestive comments to Jennifer who rejects him and attempts to get by Randy to give her brother his insulin. Randy grabs Jennifer and attempts to rape her. In walks Sandino with a baseball bat. Sandino strikes Randy across the back with the bat and Randy goes down screaming. April awakens and comes downstairs. April sees Sandino beating Randy to a pulp and starts screaming at Sandino to stop. Sandino tells April that Randy was trying to rape Jennifer and April becomes upset. Randy denies it. Sandino repeatedly says Randy tried to rape Jennifer. Randy declares Jennifer came onto him and asked for money and Jennifer screams he is a liar. Randy asks April who she believes and Aprils states that she believes Randy. April then tells Randy to go draw a bath and she'll clean him up. Sandino and Jennifer stay down stairs shocked.April slowly makes her way upstairs while Randy bathes. She walks into the bathroom and asking him what really happened. Randy says Jennifer attempted to seduce me for money, it was her fault and begins to look relieved when he thinks April is buying the story. Randy closes his eyes in the tub and April leaves the bathroom only to return with a radio. April plugs in the radio while Randy is ranting about how those awful kids need to leave. April asks him to tell her the truth. Randy continues to lie. April knows he is lying so she drops the radio closer to the bathtub water inches at a time. April starts to scream at Randy that she knows he is lying because, that is exactly what her mother's boyfriend said about her when he molested April. That is one of the reasons why she had such a strained, dysfunctional relationship with her mother. Sandino hears the ruckus and runs upstairs to beg April not to drop it, he isn't worth it! Just as April releases the radio into the bathtub Randy leaps from the bathtub, only moments to spare. April leaves the room to go to the bar. Sandino gives him three minutes to get dressed and get out of the house.Afterwards, April goes to the Indigo Club and drinks heavily. A few minutes later, Sandino enters the establishment after April. He tells her not to feel guilty, she didn't do anything wrong. April says she feels guilty because she should have seen the signs that Randy was a child molester, spending too much time looking at Jennifer's body when she passed by him. April drinks heavily because she has feelings of anger over being molested and her mom knew but told her, 'What happens in this house, stays in this house.' Where she failed April, Mama Rose had cared for her grandchildren. April says her mother should have recognized the signs in her and now she is suspicious of men who take too much of an interest in kids. April begins to turn on Sandino. She accuses Sandino of being a possible child molester because he has spent so much time looking after the kids. She asks Sandino why he cares about the kids so much. Sandino gets angry and leaves the club. April storms out behind him and yells out that he must be a child molester. Sandino turns around and begins to scream at April, telling her she is ruining her life. She is afraid of getting close to people so she pushes them away with her hardened tough-girl attitude. In addition, Sandino reveals he has been alone since he was little. Both of his parents died long ago and he was forced into the drug trade as a kid in his native country. He wasn't cared for the way a child should be and that's why he cares for Jennifer and her brothers. Sandino leaves her there in her drunken stupor and she belligerently stumbles back into the club.When April gets home, she finds a thankful Jennifer who begs and barters to stay with her. She pleads her case that her brothers have no where else to go. Emotional, April stops her mid-speech to reveal that she needs the kids to stay and she wants to learn how to care for them. She sends the kids to their new room to sleep the rest of the night.Sandino sees Jennifer, Manny and Byron the next day and tells them he is going away because he fought with April. He promises to write and call them regularly. The kids embrace him. After Sandino left, Jennifer talks to April. They unpack some of Mama Rose's things and tells her that he is a good man and April shouldn't let him go. She has had so many reasons to be distrustful of people, especially those who were too nice to her. However, Sandino seems genuine. He has always looked out for Jennifer and protected her from Randy's advances. The mood lightens thanks to comical information about the bible Jennifer relays that she gained from Madea trying to teach her about prayer and faith. Through an open window in her kitchen, April can hear the church choir down the street, singing a song her mother loved and she remarks her mother always knew when to show up. April falls into chorus and sings what she can remember about the song, right there in her kitchen. We hear the voices of Miss Wilma and Pastor Brian singing as well. Sandino is at the church service and goes up to be prayed for.After church, Sandino returns to April's house and she tells him she wants him to stay and help her with the kids. She admits that she thinks she loves him. He has no words so April, in fear of being rejected, defaults to telling him she loves him as a friend. Sandino barks that she doesn't even love herself and he loves her more than she does. She scoffs, like a buddy? And he explains that he doesn't want to make love to his buddies. Sandino explains that he is in love with April. April, shocked, laments that she is not good with relationships and really doesn't know how to love or be loved. Sandino says he'll show her and they share an incredibly passionate kiss.Sometime later, Sandino and April marry, with Jennifer, Manny and Byron participating in the wedding. They exit the church to the wedding reception, which is a block party. Tanya takes the stage to sing in honor of the newlyweds, April especially.

title: The Way Way Back
synopsis: The Way Way Back begins with four people in a car Trent (Steve Carell) driving, his girlfriend Pam (Toni Collette), a divorced Mom, sitting beside him. Trent's teenage daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) lies across the backseat listening to music; Pam's son Duncan (Liam James) sits in the rear-facing seat in the trunk of the car, known as the way way back, hence the title of the movie.While Pam sleeps, Trent asks Duncan how he rates himself on a scale from 1-10. After some badgering by Trent, Duncan hesitantly replies a 6. Trent tells him he's a 3, and that he needs to put himself out there more.They arrive at Trent's beach house, and see their neighbor, Betty (Allison Janney), who seems to be a little boozy and needy. She is divorced and has three children: an older son, who is seen later in the movie selling marijuana to some of the parents, a teenage daughter, Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), and a younger son (with a lazy eye) named Peter.They bring their things into the beach house with Betty following behind. Steph fetches her swimsuit to head to the beach. She comes downstairs, and Trent and Pam coerce Duncan to go down to the beach with her. Both kids don't want Duncan to go, but he goes to please his mother. He heads down to the beach, sitting a distance from Steph and her friends. Susanna is there with Steph, but she wants to read, while Steph and her whiney friends complain about things. Steph calls to her boyfriend Chad, complaining she wants to go in the water, and he doesn't seem to care. Steph takes off her clothes to get into her swimsuit. She sees Duncan just looking over to her, and she says, Stop staring perv. Steph and her friends go into the water. They rudely tell Susanna to go in the water with them. Duncan then leaves.On the way back to the beach house, Duncan runs into Betty and Peter, and Betty begins telling Duncan that he and Peter need to have a playdate. Duncan says he needs to ask his mom and walks away. Duncan comes home and later, comes downstairs to find Trent's party-hearty friends Joan (Amanda Peet) and Kip (Rob Corddry) chatting with Trent and Pam. They all eat dinner together, and Duncan remains quiet and seems to be miserable. The next day, Duncan finds a small girls' bike in the garage, and takes a ride into the town.At the local pizzeria he sees Owen (Sam Rockwell) playing Pacman on an old machine. They talk for a bit until Owen has to leave because his lunch break is over.Duncan comes back to the beach house and finds that they are going on Joan and Kip's boat. Duncan is forced to wear a life jacket (the only one required to do so), and Betty and Susanna tag along. They come back and later, Duncan goes outside and talks to Susanna about how it sucks here. She turns to go back indoors, and Duncan says, It looks like it's going to be a hot summer and she says, I thought we were done here.The next day, Duncan goes to the Water Wizz water park and sees Owen. Owen takes him around and takes him to get a rental bathing suit from Lewis (Jim Rash) and learns that Lewis doesn't like working there. They go up to the water slide and meet Roddy (Nat Faxon) who runs it. Owen calls him an artist because he makes girls hold and wait so he can look at their butts before they enter the water slides tube.Later, Duncan and Owen run into Caitlin (Maya Rudolph) and she asks Owen if he did his work. As Duncan leaves for the day on his bike, Owen drives up to him and offers him a ride home. They get going after Duncan's bike is put into the rear seat of the car, and he drops off Duncan at the beach house. Owen asks Duncan if he wants a job at the water park, and Duncan accepts. When she sees Owen depart, Duncan's mother, Pam, asks him who that was, and Duncan tells her he's his friend. She replies A friend with a license?The next day, Duncan reports for work at the water park. In his first scene at the water park, they see a group of people have taken cardboard and are break dancing on it. He is instructed by Owen to go over and to stop them. He turns off their music and attempts to pick up their cardboard. The guy dancing says that he can only take the cardboard if he shows them his moves. Duncan doesn't have any, but he tries some dance moves anyway. One girl from the crowd of onlookers shows up and teaches him some moves. They then flip him over and he spins on his head. He takes the cardboard, smiling brightly until he trips. Duncan is shown in a series of scenes, dancing with increasing levels of confidence. He then does what Roddy does at the top of the water slide, having the girls hold and wait so he can check them out.Duncan meets three boys who have been trying to pass each other on the water slide forever. No one has done this before. The three boys rush into the water slides tube at once and end up getting stuck and need someone to push them down.One rainy day he doesn't go to work. He stays at home and they all play the board game Candyland and end up getting into a huge fight over how strictly to apply the rules.The next day Duncan finds Owen setting up the chairs, and Duncan continues to work on his tasks. On the fourth of July, Betty hosts a clambake at the beach. At the clambake, Duncan observes Trent making out with Joan in the shadows next to the house.He returns to the table. We see Betty's oldest son passing out weed to the adults. Duncan walks on the beach with Susanna. They talk and watch the fireworks.Next day Susanna sees Duncan leave on the bike on his way to work, and she follows him to the water park. She is surprised that he works at the water park, Duncan having kept it a secret. When they meet up, he shows her around the water park. While talking to her, they are eyed by Owen and Roddy, who call Duncan over using the loudspeaker. They ask Duncan who the young woman is and why he doesn't seal the deal with her.He returns to Susanna, and Owen announces over the loud speaker Duncan please return to your lady friend and let her know this conversation was entirely about her.That night, Duncan arrives back at the beach house and he notices that Trent's car isn't there. Pam, Steph and Duncan wait for a while and then eat dinner without him. Trent returns later that night and says he was stuck on the boat with Kip.The next day there is a party at a neighbor's house. Steph, Duncan and Susanna eat with the adults. Trent and Joan go out to dance. Pam overhears Kip telling Betty that the boat hasn't been working for a week, and needs help to fix it. Pam realizes that Trent's excuse was a lie, so she gets upset and walks away.Duncan gets up from the table and says, He's sleeping with her! And you know it! They get into an argument, and it gets a little physical.Later that night, Duncan sees Trent and Pam arguing. He goes down to the beach with Susanna. They talk about ghost crabs. He tries to kiss Susanna, but she leans back. Duncan is embarrassed and runs away from the beach.He sees Peter, who demands that Duncan take him wherever he's going. They go to a going away party for Lewis at the water park. As Lewis starts to make a speech, Roddy, Caitlin and Duncan surprise him by spraying him with water from water guns. A general water gun fight ensues.Duncan and Owen talk the next morning about Trent, and Duncan tells Owen about the time that he called him a 3. The next morning when Duncan arrives back at the beach house, he sees his mom packing, and he infers that he and his mother are leaving. But he is told they are all leaving together, which upsets him.As they are packing the car, Susanna comes over to say goodbye and kisses Duncan, and tells him that she was just taken by surprise the night before. Duncan sees Steph looking on, and says Stop staring, perv.They get into the same seats in the car as at the beginning of the movie. They drive away and pass the water park. The song Power Hungry Animals plays. They stop at a gas station and Duncan hops out of the car and runs towards the water park. Pam and the others chase after him.Inside the water park Pam sees a noticeboard with a sign that says Employee of the Month and the photo is of Duncan. Duncan tells Owen he is going to pass him on the water slide. The two rush up the stairs to water slide, dive inside the tube, and Duncan comes out before Owen does. Duncan becomes the first person to ever pass someone on the water slide.We see that, despite his big plans for the future, Lewis is still working there.Owen talks to Pam and Trent. He tells Pam that she's got a hell of a kid in Duncan. Owen says Hi to Trent, saying, I'm a good friend of 'the 3'. Duncan tells Pam he needs a minute with Owen before they leave, and Duncan and Owen say an emotional goodbye. They then all get into Trent's station wagon again.On the road all four passengers sit in silence, absorbed in their thoughts. After a few minutes Pam climbs over the seats and gets into the back with Duncan. They smile at each other. The movie closes.

title: Shutter
synopsis: Shutter tells the story of photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and his new wife Jane (Rachael Taylor). The film begins with the couple's wedding, and the audience learns that they are planning to leave their apartment in Brooklyn for Japan, where Ben has been hired to take pictures for a particular client. The couple has made the decision to leave for Japan a few days early, renting a cabin so they can enjoy a shorter honeymoon. In the car on the way to the cabin, Jane gets lost and asks a sleeping Ben to check the map. While attempting to get their bearings, Jane sees a girl walk into the road. She hits the girl, and swerves off the road, crashing the car into a tree. They both fall unconscious. When she awakens, Jane realizes the girl could very well still be laying in the road, and rushes out of the car to find her, Ben on her heels. They find nothing, and Ben thinks that the girl was already found and has gotten the medical help that she would need. He also thinks the injuries weren't life-threatening, as they cannot find any blood or evidence of a collision and wants to call for help. Later, help does arrive for them, and they are able to continue with their travel to the cabin, but Jane is haunted by the image of the girl. Ben's shoulder is bothering him, since the accident. Jane tells him he needs to get it checked out. Ben chooses to ignore it, and at the cabin, they are able to enjoy a few day long honeymoon, and Ben wants to take pictures to record the event.Days later, Ben has to report for work with his friend Bruno (David Denman) Jane accompanies him but is somewhat left to her own devices as Ben needs to meet with the clients right away. We learn that Ben is fluent in Japanese, while Jane is not. Later, the pair are taken to their home, a building of which they are the solo occupants, and also the home of Ben's photography studio. Jane notices an alcove where an old chair sits, and the image sticks with her. After meeting Ben's assistant Seiko (Maya Hazen), Jane again is left to her own devices while Ben works. She eventually gets the photos from the honeymoon, which are full of a mysterious light, and in showing the photos to Ben, makes the realization that something is off with them. Ben simply assumes there was an error with the camera. Seiko mentions that the light is not from a camera error, but from spirit energy. Interested, Jane asks how she knows what the light is, to which Seiko responds that her ex-boyfriend runs a spirit photography magazine. She insists that Jane meet her ex the next day after work, and Ben, hearing that the girls have made plans to go out, jokes that the girls have a date. That night, Ben, Jane, Bruno, his date and Adam (John Hensley) go out to a traditional Japanese restaurant. Here we learn that Adam is a model agent, but that his motives may not be in the best interest for the models.The next day, Jane heads with Seiko to see the spirit photography magazine Seiko's ex Yoko (Eri Otoguro). While there, Jane learns that the magazine is mostly full of fake photographs, but that 1) a Polaroid picture cannot be faked and 2) a psychic named Murase (Kei Yamamoto) was written up by the magazine for his efforts in analyzing the photos. Later, Jane tells Ben about her visit and asks him to go with her. Ben's shoulder continues to bother him, and he goes to the doctor. While there, he is weighed a couple of times, and the doctor tells him that there is no source of injury, but that he will give him some medicine for the pain. Rattled himself by the presence of the light in some of his work photos which have landed him in hot water with the client and a random encounter with 'someone' in the darkroom, he agrees to travel with Jane to visit Murase.Once at the home of Murase, Jane and Ben show him the photos and tell him that there was an accident and they believe this spirit may be that of the girl Jane hit. Ben serves as translator between the two. Murase takes the photos and begins to speak very emotionally, but Ben does not translate all of what he says, and tells her they are leaving. Ben does tell her that spirits bond with humans when extreme emotions (love, hate, anger, etc) are involved.Jane later looks at the photos of the project that were ruined by the light, and decides to go visit the office building in the photo that the light seems to be around. Armed with a borrowed Polaroid camera from Ben's studio, she heads to the building to take pictures and see if she finds any proof of the spirit's presence in the building. When she gets there, she goes to the floor where the light has gathered, and takes pictures in the empty office. She has her first encounter, and learns the girl's name Megumi Okina through a picture frame that falls on the ground and shatters. Megumi is in the photo and when looking at it, Jane learns that her husband Ben took the photograph.When she confronts Ben about it, he admits that he and Megumi were involved in a relationship, but that she became obsessive and clingy, despite the fact that her traditional Japanese family did not approve of the pair. If anything, the disapproval made Megumi even more clingy to Ben, who was trying his hardest to balance work and his blossoming relationship. Megumi's father, the main person who did not approve of the pair, dies, and Megumi becomes obsessive and even at one point becomes suicidal. Realizing this is too much for him to handle, Ben quits Megumi. Ben, admitting that he never loved her, gets Adam and Bruno to speak to her about the fact that the relationship is over and that she needs to stop following him around. Jane is upset with that, but decides they have to find Megumi. Ben talks to Bruno, who says that he recently saw Megumi on the street, she was pointing at him.Adam is at his photography studio taking pictures of a prospective model, an Australian hostess that he mentioned at the dinner. He asks her to take off her clothing, except her underwear, and goes to get his camera from a box full of scantily-clad women. We get the impression that his motives at this point are not good at all. He begins taking pictures and starts seeing Megumi through the camera lens. He keeps stopping taking pictures, which begins to irritate the model. He is ready to take another picture, and the next thing we see is that the camera lens has shattered in his eye.Meanwhile, Ben and Jane are at Megumi's home looking for evidence of her location. They find her, seemingly having been dead for a long time, as flies and decay have began, along with bottles of potassium cyanide strewn along the floor. They are still in shock over this discovery when Ben receives a call from Bruno about Adam's accident. Ben says that they will meet Bruno at the hospital.After being at the hospital for a while and Bruno does not turn up, Ben calls his cellphone in an effort to find out when he'll get there. Bruno answers but does not say anything, and as the camera pans out, the audience sees that he is slicing up photographs (into shapes of origami) with a razor blade and his hands are all bloody. Ben tells Bruno's voicemail that they desperately need him at the hospital because Adam didn't make it. Ben and Jane leave the hospital and head to Bruno's home to see if he is there.When they arrive, they find all his picture frames are still on the walls, but the photos are all cut up on the table, and that the television is loud and blaring. Ben begins to look around for him, while Jane examines the photos on the table. She sees Bruno standing at the end of the hall, and it appears he is charging at her. Ben calls out to him, and Bruno runs past Jane (who dives out of the way) and jumps off the balcony of his high-rise and goes crashing onto the concrete. He is dead. Ben is visibly distraught.Ben and Jane have decided to return to New York at this point, when in a voiceover, Ben says that Megumi's funeral will be in a few days, she will be cremated, and after the service, they can return home. When they return home to pack things, Jane opens a Fed-Ex that she has received containing photos of their wedding, and Jane makes the statement, we aren't going anywhere. Megumi is present in their wedding photos. They decide to leave the apartment and go to a hotel to spend the night.That night, Ben is haunted by images of Megumi in the room, her brushing her hair, her looking at him, her sitting on the floor, her initiating sex with him...all while Jane sleeps. He is very upset and somewhat frantic, and the ghost of Megumi confronts him with a kiss, and Jane wakes to find him choking. She watches him choke and attempts to help him, gets caught by the ghost in a curtain and smashed up against a window which cracks. In her desperation, Jane finally yells, He didn't love you! to which Megumi stops. Ben is gasping for air, but alive.At Megumi's funeral, her body is cremated. Ben and Jane watch the process and hold hands. They return to New York, where seemingly all is over. However, this is not the case. Ben is out, seemingly at work, when Jane wants to take a picture of the rose petal shaped heart Ben has left her with a disposable camera. However, the camera is full of ready-to-be-developed pictures. She heads out to start her day and takes the camera with her, seemingly to drop it off at a developer. When she returns home, she has the photos in an envelope. While preparing dinner, she opens the envelope and is shocked by what she sees. In the pictures, of her and Ben frolicking around while still in their wedding clothes, the ghost of Megumi is visibly in the photos, crawling towards the couple and eventually standing near a portrait of Jane that (seemingly) Ben took. Jane looks in Ben's belongings for the camera that he used in Japan, and finds the removable drive in the camera, which she loads into the computer, and is digusted by what she finds.When Ben gets home, he can immediately tell something is wrong with Jane. He asks her what is wrong and she opens the laptop and asks him what the photos are of...and how he could do such a thing. We see the picture of Megumi, with Bruno and Adam, in a compromising position. Ben tells Jane that Megumi was crazy, she was obsessed and she wouldn't stop harassing him. So when Bruno and Adam got involved, Adam suggested giving her some pills that were like sleeping pills but a little stronger, and photographing her in compromising positions that they could use to blackmail her against her prim and proper family to finally leave Ben alone. However, when the situation was happening, Ben took the photos but Adam and Bruno (more than likely drunk themselves) took advantage of Megumi and forced themselves on her. (The audience is led to believe this by the comments they make and the fact that they show the look on Ben's face). Ben admits to Jane that the situation got out of control but absolves himself of blame since he never touched her. Jane is digusted, and realizes that Megumi was trying to warn her of the man she loves, that Megumi did not want to harm her at all.She starts to leave him, telling him that she needs time to think and then recants, saying she needs no time to figure out that he's not the person she thought he was and that she's done. Jane departs, leaving Ben alone in the apartment. Ben takes out a Polaroid camera and begins photographing the apartment looking for Megumi. He yells, Me and you together forever, is that what you want? You got it! The pictures show nothing, and in anger, he drops the camera and it takes a photo. He picks up the photo and looks at it, and it shows Megumi is sitting on his shoulders. This explains his injury and why his shoulder has been hurting him so and why the nurse weighed him multiple times, his weight was that of 275, the weight of two people. In an effort to rid himself of her once and for all, hooks up a large amount of power to a photography light, which he puts to his neck. The power goes out in the building and we hear Ben's screams.The next scene is in a hospital. A nurse is wheeling a tray of food and drink into a room. We see the patient in the room is Ben, who appears completely catatonic, his head slung over and head closely shaved. The nurse injects his arm with a needle, sets the food down on the table and leaves the room, locking the door behind her. As it closes, we see that the spirit of Megumi is hugging Ben, causing him to be slumped over.

title: Saw
synopsis: The film begins with photographer Adam Faulkner (Leigh Whannell) waking up in a bathtub filled with water. In his instinctive flailing, his foot catches and removes its plug; as the water drains a glowing blue object can be briefly seen to be washed away with it. After a few cries for help it is revealed that he is not, in fact, alone. Surgeon Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) is on the other side of the same room, and soon finds the switch to turn on the lights.Both men are inside a grimy, dilapidated industrial bathroom, chained to pipes at opposite corners of the room. Between them, out of their reach, is a body lying in a pool of blood, holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Both men discover envelopes in their pockets which contain microtapes; Gordon also holds a bullet and a key that does not unlock their shackles. Adam, with Lawrence's help, manages to snag the player from the body with which they play their tapes. Both tapes have the same voice, distorted by a pitch modulator. Adam's tape refers to him as a voyeur and asks, Are you going to watch yourself die, or do something about it? Gordon's tape reveals he must kill Adam before six o'clock (within seven hours as evident by a clock on the wall), or his wife and daughter will die and he will be left in the bathroom, presumably forever to starve to death. Let the game begin... the voice concludes. Hacksaws are soon discovered in the toilet tank; neither is sufficiently sharp to cut chain, and Adam accidentally snaps his in frustration. Dr. Gordon realizes that the saws are meant instead for their own ankles, which, if sawed through, would free them from their shackles.The film then presents flashbacks of their captor's previous victims: Paul and Mark. Both men failed to escape, and hence had pieces of skin cut from them in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece; thus the genesis for referring to him as the Jigsaw Killer by the detectives Tapp (Danny Glover), Sing (Ken Leung) and Kerry (Dina Meyer) who investigate the murders. Back in the bathroom, Dr. Gordon comments that they are dealing with a misnomer, as the killer never directly murders his victims nor places them in situations where death is unavoidable. In yet another flashback we are shown the police interrogation (with Dr. Gordon witnessing behind a window) of Jigsaw's only known survivor, a highly traumatized heroin addict named Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), who believes that her experience in the test has made her a better person in the end.After a brief sequence where Adam and Dr. Gordon discover a hidden camera, another flashback sequence shows Gordon's last moments with his family, and their subsequent abduction. Another flashback shows an attempt by Tapp and Sing illegally breaking and entering into what turns out to be one of Jigsaw's lairs. The two discover a man tied to a chair with two drills mounted on each side. Before the Detectives can secure Jigsaw's arrest, he starts the drills. While Tapp subdues Jigsaw, Sing attempts to save Jeff. Though Jigsaw helpfully points out a box that contains the key to release Jeff, the box in question is seemingly endlessly filled with keys; Sing shoots the drills instead, but the gunshots distract Tapp long enough for Jigsaw to escape, who slashes and permanently scars Tapp's throat in the process. While Tapp recovers from his deep knife wound, Sing pursues Jigsaw and is killed by multiple shotguns set on a tripwire.His partner's death has a permanent effect on Tapp, and what was already an unhealthy fascination with the case deepens into an obsession that leads to him being discharged from the police force. Convinced from a piece of evidence from earlier in the film that Dr. Gordon is the Jigsaw killer, Tapp moves into a house across the street from Gordon's and monitors it with video surveillance.Back in the bathroom, Gordon (with assistance from Adam) discovers a box holding cigarettes, a lighter and a note suggesting he dip a cigarette in poisoned blood from the body and uses it to kill Adam. Gordon and Adam attempt to fool the camera by faking Adam's death with the un-poisoned cigarette, but a strong electric shock is sent through Adam's chain, proving Adam to still be alive. The box also contains a cell phone which cannot make calls, but receives one from his wife Alison (Monica Potter), who tells Gordon that Adam knows more than he is revealing. Adam explains that he had been paid by Detective Tapp to spy on Gordon, and has witnessed him going to a hotel with the intention of cheating on his wife. In fact, Gordon left the hotel before doing anything, but this is between Gordon and the other woman, Carla (one of the med students to which Gordon had been explaining the condition of a cancer patient of his, John Kramer), and no mention is made of possible previous encounters. In the pile of Adam's photographs which he hid from view of Gordon when found with the hacksaws, the two find a photograph of an orderly at Gordon's hospital named Zep, seen through Gordon's window after he left the house. Just as this realization is made, however, the hour of six PM strikes.Alison manages to free herself and take control of Zep's handgun, however she is soon overpowered. Shots are fired, which attract the attention of Tapp, who wounds Zep. He is unable to keep him from leaving the house, however, intent on killing Gordon; who is only aware of the sounds of screaming and gunshots. Flung into a state of desperate temporary insanity, he follows his instructions by sawing off his foot and shooting Adam with the revolver held by the body in the middle of the room and the bullet found in his envelope.Zep arrives, pursued by Tapp, however Zep manages to shoot Tapp fatally. He then enters the bathroom but tells Gordon he's too late, because it's the rules. Adam recovers from his gunshot wound, which was in fact non-fatal, and kills Zep with the toilet tank lid. Gordon crawls away to seek medical attention, promising to return with help.Adam searches Zep for a key to his chain and instead finds another micro-cassette player. As the climatic theme of the series, Hello Zep, begins, the tape informs Adam, that Zep was also following instructions under pain of death. As soon as Jigsaw's familiar voice ceases, the body lying in the center of the bathroom lets out a long breath. As Adam watches, his face frozen in horror, the dead man peels off the latex that gave the appearance of his head wound and then slowly rises to his feet. He is John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a terminal brain cancer patient of Gordon's; he is seen, briefly, in the same flashback where Zep is (equally briefly) introduced. Jigsaw/John Kramer, whose voice is in fact quite weak, informs Adam that the key to his chain was in the bathtub all along; a quick flashback replays the opening scene of the movie, where an object is seen to disappear down the drain with the water.Adam reaches for a gun to shoot John, but is stunned with electricity, triggering an extended flashback sequence that runs through the vital shots of the movie in roughly 30 seconds. Just before he flicks off the lights in the bathroom for the last time, John repeats a line he said to Amanda immediately after she escaped: Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore. John then shouts: Game Over! before slamming the door shut, sealing Adam in the bathroom forever, screaming his despair over the end credits.

title: Alien³
synopsis: Scenes that were cut from the theatrical version of the film but restored for the 2003 DVD Assembly Cut appear in red. Scenes that appear only in the Theatrical Version and no longer in the Assembly Cut appear in blue.In the opening credits of the film, the Sulaco, the large military ship carrying the survivors from the mission to LV-426 (as seen in the movie Aliens), is en route to Earth. Newt, Hicks, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), and the remains of the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) are all safely in hypersleep. However, a stowaway Alien egg on the ship has released a facehugger. It breaks the glass of one of the tubes, wounding itself. Acid dripping from the facehugger starts an electrical fire, and the ship responds automatically. The medical scanner shows the facehugger as it is attached to one of the sleeping figures. Unable to contain the fire, the automated systems of the Sulaco eject all the cryotubes into an escape pod and eject the pod into outer space. The navigation systems lead the escape vehicle to the nearest planet, which happens to be Fiorina Fury 161, home to a penal colony populated by life-sentence XYY-chromosome prisoners, all of whom are multiple murderers and rapists. Unsurprisingly, it is owned and operated by Weyland-Yutani, the omnipresent company that employed Ripley. The EEV crash lands in the water near the shore.A man, Dr. Clemens (Charles Dance), wanders alone along the shoreline when he sees a strange figure lying on the beach. It is Ripley, covered in mud and barely alive. Clemens takes her inside and warns the prisoners that an EEV has crash-landed, and that they need to extract it from the water quickly. He performs CPR on Ripley, who starts breathing again. In the meanwhile, the prisoners use oxen to pull the remains of the EEV from the water. Superintendent Andrews (Brian Glover) prepares a message to the Company: Message screens read that the EEV has been salvaged, but the young female (Newt) has drowned, Corporal Hicks is dead, and Bishop is damaged beyond repair. Ripley is the only survivor as she receives immediate care at the infirmary. The prisoners tow the wreckage back to the prison by crane. Spike, the Rottweiler belonging to one of the inmates, barks fiercely at a facehugger that is still inside the EEV that goes unnoticed by the prison crew..Mr Aaron (Ralph Brown), Andrews' assistant, assembles the inmates as they go into prayer. In an attempt to prevent rumours from spreading, director Andrews (Brian Glover) announces the news to the prison population, making note that the only survivor of the EEV crash is a woman. Two prisoners, Morse (Danny Webb) and Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the spiritual leader of the prisoners, view the presence of a woman to be disruptive in the all-male population, out of concern for the spiritual well-being of their brothers, many of whom have adopted a fundamentalist, millenarian denomination of Christianity and have vowed celibacy. Andrews assures them that he has requested a Company rescue team to pick her up. He leaves Ripley in the care of doctor Clemens (Charles Dance), under orders that she's not to leave the infirmary until the rescue ship arrives for her.Ripley awakens from hypersleep and is disoriented, but Clemens stabilizes her with an injection. She is distraught to learn of her circumstances, especially the news that her companions are dead. She demands that Clemens take her to the wreckage of the EEV. He takes her through the blast furnace to the EEV and explains that the prison once accommodated 5000 inmates, but has since been reduced to a custodial staff of 25, to keep the furnace functioning. She hears that Hicks got hit by a support beam upon impact, and was instantly killed. Bishop was lying around in pieces; what was left of him was dumped on the trash heap. The news that Newt drowned in her cryotube after the ship crashed makes her break down in tears, despite Clemens' assurance that Newt probably wasn't conscious when it happened. Before she can process the information, she sees some acid scorching from the facehugger on the side of the cryotube, and immediately suspects the presence of an Alien. Ripley asks to see Newt's body. Clemens takes her to the morgue. He asks her if Newt was her daughter; she denies it. She asks to be alone with Newt for a while. As Clemens leaves, she looks for signs that Newt was impregnated by a facehugger. As there is none, she eventually insists on an autopsy, under the guise of a communicable infection, cholera. Clemens is suspicious, but gives in to her emotional request. The autopsy is gruesome for Ripley to watch, but Clemens finds nothing but the usual signs that the child drowned. Superintendent Andrews and Mr Aaron (Ralph Brown) enter, dismayed that Clemens started an autopsy without their approval. Clemens claims there was risk of infectious disease, and did not want to take any risks. Andrews explains that he wants Ripley confined to the infirmary, as he doesn't wish to upset the religious male population. Ripley insists that the bodies be cremated, to which Andrews protests, until Clemens assures him that the risk of a cholera outbreak is still present. Andrews allows Clemens and the prisoners to prepare a funeral for her friends.Inmates Murphy (Christopher Fairbank) and Frank (Carl Chase) drag a lifeless ox inside the kitchen and hang her upside down to be slaughtered later. They discuss Ripley and seem to forget about their celibacy vows for a moment. Apparently, the ox dropped dead for no apparent reason. As they leave, Murphy finds a dead facehugger. Inmate Murphy (Christopher Fairbank) is looking for Spike, his Rottweiler. He finds the animal, apprehensive and with wounds in its face, but otherwise healthy. He wonders who could do such a thing to a dog.Since the prison was used as a lead works at one time, the prisoners will use the blast furnace to cremate the bodies. Andrews reads a short ceremonial text for the deceased, followed by a chilling and powerful eulogy by Dillon. Unseen by anyone, a new Alien is born: Spike, the Rottweiler, goes into convulsions, and explodes with a chestburster that moves on all fours emerging, running off to some distant location inside the maze-like prison complex. The dead ox in the kitchen starts to twitch, and a chestburster that moves on all fours emerges, running off to some distant location inside the maze-like prison complex.Ripley, whose head is now shaved due to the lice problem on the planet, bathes herself. She has now said goodbye to her new surrogate family, and is once again starting over. In the mess hall, Dillon confronts prisoners Boggs (Leon Herbert) and Rains (Christopher John Fields), who complain about fellow inmate Golic (Paul McGann). They refuse to work with him as they think that he is crazy and smells bad. Dillon reproaches them for this and demands that they treat Golic like an equal. The two reluctantly grumble their agreement. Ripley enters the mess hall and attempts to thank Dillon for his eulogy. Despite his disturbing warning (he informs her that he is a murderer and rapist of women) she sits down at his table. He asks her about her faith, assuring her that although strictly talking, there is no place for women in their adopted religion, they will nevertheless tolerate her.In a private moment, Clemens informs Ripley about the history of the prisoners and the penal colony; how they stayed after the Company closed the prison, their adopted religion and his tense relation with Andrews. She tries to find out how he got his current position as medical officer on such a barren place. Clemens eludes the answer by asking about the real reason for the autopsy, but Ripley evades the question by seducing him. The two of them become attracted to one another and share a sexual encounter.Meanwhile, prisoner Murphy is working in an isolated tunnel when he finds a shed skin. Hearing movement, he thinks it is his dog Spike. He finds the embryonic Alien finishing its metamorphosis into an adult. It attacks him, spitting acid in his face. Blinded and howling with pain, he falls backwards into a gigantic fan and is immediately shredded to bits.Clemens again tries to get information from Ripley, but she wants to know about a barcode she noticed on the back of his head. He says he will tell her some other time. Clemens is called away to investigate Murphy's remains. Andrews is quick to conclude that Murphy was too distracted by the presence of Ripley, and came to close to the sucking fan; Clemens, however, concludes that the fan was blowing in Murphy's direction. He also finds a burn mark, similar to the one Ripley discovered on Newt's tube. When he leaves, Andrews requests a private conversation later.Clemens finds Ripley rummaging inside the EEV wreckage, retrieving its flight recorder. He tells her about Murphy's death and the burn he found. She begins to realize that maybe an Alien did survive after all. Clemens wants to help her, but insists that Ripley trust him, and tell him the whole story. She replies that in order for her to share that information with him, she needs to recover Bishop's remains so she can access information from the EEV's flight recorder. Clemens points her the way to the garbage dump, but he cannot escort her there, as he has a meeting with Andrews.Meanwhile, Boggs, Rains and Golic are prepped to go on a survey assignment. Dillon asks them to light a candle for Murphy on the way. Clemens enters Andrews' office. At first, Andrews is pleasant, but suddenly he turns verbally aggressive. Andrews berates Clemens for letting Ripley wander on alone. He also shares that the installation has received an unprecedented high-level communication from Weyland-Yutani regarding Ripley. The automated communications with the Sulaco have informed them of Ripley's whereabouts, and they have dispatched a rescue team to come pick her up. Andrews understands that Ripley must be very important to them, but can't imagine why. After a hostile exchange with Clemens, where the warden threatens to share Clemens' dark history with Ripley, Andrews grills him about what he might know about Ripley. He can only confirm that she was part of a combat team that was wiped out. Andrews dismisses him.Ripley finds Bishop's remains in the garbage dump. As she tries to leave, she is cornered by three prisoners. They attack her and bend her brutally over a nearby railing, intending to rape her. Dillon rescues her and properly 'reeducates' his brothers, beating them with a piece of steel. As she leaves, Ripley violently punches one of her attackers in the face.Golic finds an old cigarette machine and grabs as much cigarettes as he can, much to the annoyance of Boggs and Rains. Boggs (Leon Herbert), Rains (Christopher John Fields) and Golic (Paul McGann) arrive in a large room and start placing candles to measure the area. However, somewhere in the distance, some candles are being blown out. Assuming one of the inmates is pulling a prank, Rains goes in to investigate. He finds the fully grown Alien, which grabs him and begins biting him. Boggs and Golic come to investigate the screaming, and upon seeing the monster, they run away back to the entrance, only to find Rains' dead body lying there. Boggs is suddenly snatched and attacked from above by the Alien. It rips out Boggs' throat and the blood sprays on Golic, who is momentarily frozen to the spot, seemingly in awe and then flees the area in blind panic.Elsewhere, Ripley reconnects what is left of Bishop to a power supply in the infirmary and reactivates him. He immediately notices Ripley's new hairstyle. Meanwhile, Golic has returned to the mess hall, where an inmate finds him eating, smiling manically while covered in blood. The inmate returns with Dillon and some others, who restrain Golic. Using Bishop to access the flight recorder from the EEV, Ripley finds out that a fire caused their ejection from the Sulaco, and Bishop confirms that an Alien traveled with them to Fiorina 161. This information has been shared with the network, so the Company knows about this as well. As he is beyond decent repair, Ripley grants his last wish, and permanently disconnects him.Golic is dragged into the infirmary, ranting on about a dragon that attacked his friends. Andrews and the others dismiss him as insane, but Dillon defends him, stating that Golic may be a fool, but he has never been a liar. Andrews even refuses to believe Ripley after she confirms the story. She requests a meeting with him later that evening, which he grants her after his duties. Ripley tells him all about the Alien, but Andrews is not impressed. She learns that, aside from some knives and fire axes, there are no weapons on the colony. Andrews also doesn't believe her story and confines her to the infirmary until the rescue team arrives.Ripley refuses to recount her story to Clemens, out of fear of being written off as crazy herself. Golic seems to be raving mad, quoting that in an insane world, a sane man must appear insane, much to Clemens' derision. Ripley asks Clemens about the barcode on the back of his head. Clemens admits that he was a former prisoner on Fiorina, sentenced there after a morphine addiction and a bad medical decision caused several deaths. When the prison was turned into a lead shielding factory and the population reduced, he decided to stay with the inmates, knowing no one else would hire him as a doctor ever again. Pleased with his sincerity, Ripley gives her trust to Clemens, but the Alien suddenly appears in the infirmary, emerging from a ventilation shaft. It immediately grabs and kills Clemens and advances on Ripley, cornering her against a wall. For one terrifying moment, it seems to examine her, pressing itself right up against her cheek, but instead it retreats and takes the body of Clemens with it. Golic gazes in awe and admiration of the creature. Ripley bolts and rushes to the others, who are all congregated in the mess hall. Dillon once again initiates a prayer, in which he vents his anger about the recent deaths, and reprimands his brothers for the near-rape of Ripley. Andrews tries to prevent rumours by presenting his facts. He tells the inmates that Murphy got killed by his own carelessness, and that Boggs and Rains are missing, presumably killed by a deranged Golic; Dillon begrudgingly hears the story. Andrews requests several volunteers to organise a search party for the missing inmates. Suddenly, Ripley dashes in, warning that the Alien is here. Andrews tries to silence her and orders for her to be dragged back to the infirmary, but is suddenly snatched through a vent above him by the Alien, right in front of all the prisoners; the vent drips with blood afterwards.As one of the inmates wipes the floor, the rest of the group congregates in the Assembly area. Dillon again leads a prayer, convinced that the group is now being tested by God for their sins. Now that there can be no question about whether or not they are in danger, the prisoners attempt to deal with their situation. Aaron feels he is Andrews' most logical successor, but the prisoners seem to hold him in low regard by calling him '85', and nobody takes him seriously as leader. Ripley informs the prisoners what she knows about the Alien, although this one is definitely different from the others she has seen. She remembers that the others were only afraid of fire. However, the absence of anything close to weapons or a surveillance system in the prison creates considerable tension amongst the prisoners; Morse even blames Ripley for bringing the Alien with her, suggesting they should kill her; unafraid of Morse's threats, Ripley says she's okay with that. Finally, Dillon restores the peace with his natural leadership, even though he doesn't want to be a leader.An inspection of the floor plan shows that the basement houses a large system of tunnels and a toxic waste containment unit that can be completely sealed off. There are also barrels of highly combustible material left behind in the colony. Eventually they come up with a plan; they will use this material to burn the Alien out of the tunnels, at which point they will force it into the containment unit and trap it indefinitely. Ripley makes an inspection with an inmate, where she learns that Aaron's nickname '85' came from his file, which stated it is his IQ. The inmates start making preparations by mopping the tunnel with the fuel. Some of them start searching for working batteries for the flashlight, while others start working in the narrow tunnels. Dillon notices that Ripley is unwell, seemingly missing doctor Clemens. Unfortunately, the plan backfires when the Alien attacks one of the inmates before they can finish: he drops a flare which ignites the fuel. Many prisoners get trapped in the burning tunnels and their numbers are drastically reduced. Dillon asks one of the prisoners to activate the sprinkler system, while Ripley helps two of the injured people: they appear to be two of the men from the rape attempt. Unexpectedly, the plan to flush out the Alien works: the creature suddenly emerges in the tunnel, blocked at one end by a large group including Ripley and Dillon, and on the other end by prisoner Junior (Holt McCallany). He runs to the chamber, taunting the Alien to follow him. The door is shut and Junior can be heard screaming inside as the creature kills him. After the creature is contained, Dillon activates the sprinkler system, extinguishing the fires. They then move through the tunnels, collecting their dead comrades.Dillon holds a sermon commemorating the dead inmates, as Ripley and Aaron discuss what will happen next. Aaron mentions that the Company will come and kill the Alien. He also mentions that the Company has designated Ripley as top priority. In the meanwhile, Golic is guarded by Morse in the infirmary. He succeeds in convincing Morse to let him out of his straight jacket, since he was innocent of killing Boggs and Rains anyway. Golic briefly states his intention to free the Alien before knocking out Morse, and leaves.Ripley and Aaron send a communication to the Weyland-Yutani network, informing them that they have trapped the Alien and request permission to kill it. A message returns immediately, stating that a rescue team is on its way, and their request for termination is denied. Golic arrives at the containment chamber and tells Arthur (Deobia Oparei), who is standing guard, that he needs to see the beast. Arthur refuses, as the Alien would certainly kill him and escape. Golic suddenly lashes out with a razor, and slashes Arthur's throat, while frantically lamenting what he did. He enters the chamber, and asks the creature what to do next. A shadow closes in on him, and moments later, the Alien is seen running out into the tunnel system.Ripley confronts Dillon with her suspicion that the Company will not kill the Alien, but intends to take the creature with them. Although she is not concerned with what happens to the Company people, she fears the creature will escape and spread to other worlds. Dillon says that he and his friends are outcasts, and can no longer be concerned what happens to the rest of humanity. They are interrupted by Morse, coming in with bad news. They go to the containment chamber and find it empty, with both Arthur and Golic dead. After the fire dies out, a tour through the tunnel identifies 10 dead inmates. Aaron scolds Morse for his ill-fated decision to release Golic. With options seemingly running out, Aaron and Morse argue about what to do, until Dillon ceases their unproductive bickering. Ripley suffers pains in her chest and suspects internal bleeding. Aaron helps her with the biomedical scanner in the wrecked EEV, where they discover something worse: it was Ripley who was impregnated by the facehugger in the Sulaco, and she is carrying an Alien embryo. Even worse, the embryo is a Queen, and therefore capable of replicating the entire Alien colony.Dillon has gathered the inmates in the Assembly area again, updating them on the current state of affairs. He suggests staying in the Assembly area, as it has no ducts, so the Alien could only come through the door. The prisoners argue that since they have no weapons of relevance, they would be trapped there with no way to defend themselves. Morse lights a match for his cigarette; this sparks a sudden realization that the Alien's only fear is fire. Immediately, the group moves towards the much safer furnace area, where they heat will hopefully keep the Alien out.Ripley suspects that Weyland-Yutani knows about the Alien embryo already. She asks Aaron to send a message to the Company, stating that the whole base has gone toxic and they should stay away. Aaron asks why, as he is still under the impression that the Company will come to kill off the creature. Ripley warns him that if the Company arrives, they will take the Alien for their own purposes just like they've always wanted to do. Even worse, they could get hold of the Queen she is carrying, and the whole of humanity will be in grave danger. However, Aaron doesn't believe her story. He wants the Company to come, as his job on the colony is done, so they can take him home to his wife and child. Despite stating that he likes Ripley and it is nothing personal, Aaron refuses to send the message.Knowing that she herself is doomed, Ripley seeks out the Alien in the basement of the complex, hoping it will kill her. She locates the beast and attacks it with a rod, but she finds out that she mistook a rusty pipe for the Alien's head. Immediately, the Alien appears behind her from an overhead space, and lands in front of her.Dillon is in the cell complex, when he is startled by Ripley's sudden appearance. Ripley tells him that she sought out the Alien, but it refused to harm her; it can somehow sense that she is carrying the Queen, which is why it did not kill her in the infirmary earlier. Since she does not want the Queen to fall into Company hands, and knowing that she can never survive the Queen's 'birthing', she asks Dillon to kill her. He agrees to do it, and prepares to give Ripley a fatal blow with a fire axe; however, he has a last-second chance of heart. He refuses to kill Ripley over her objections, stating that it would be a defeat to kill her now with the adult Alien still running around killing people. Instead, the fact that the Alien will not kill Ripley may be used to the group's advantage. Dillon promises to give Ripley a quick and painless death, as soon as the creature is dead.The group congregates in the furnace: Dillon and Ripley's plan is to fire up the blast furnace, lure the Alien into the lead mold and drown it in the hot metal. The prisoners will act as bait, rushing down the corridors of the lead works, closing off all the entrances until the Alien is forced into the mold. Initially, the plan is not met with much enthusiasm; some prisoners, and Aaron, still believe that the Company plans to rescue them by killing the Alien for them. Ripley tells them about the two previous encounters with the Alien, and how the Company relentlessly sacrificed its crew to obtain the creature. Dillon finally convinces the others that it is better to go down fighting than die begging on one's knees, and it may be their first step toward heaven. Aaron still dismisses the plan as foolish, and returns to the top floor to wait for the Company crew.Ripley and Dillon inspect the piston of the leadworks. Since it has not been used for 5 years, it is not certain whether it will work. Ripley will pull the lever to activate the piston that will trap the Alien in the mold, but there will only be one chance to do this as the machinery cannot be reset in time. A few of the inmates discuss Dillon's promise of a place in heaven, and decide that they should try anyway. Prisoner David (Pete Postlethwaite) starts to have second thoughts about running around in the leadworks while being chased by an Alien. Morse yells that the door he is supposed to close is no longer working. A distant scream signals the beginning of the chase. Several inmates successfully lure the Alien through the corridors towards the mold. However, the maze-like design of the leadworks causes a lot of confusion. Several inmates find the remains of their friends, and some get so lost that they end up back at the piston; One prisoner unexpectedly runs into the Alien and gets killed.In the meanwhile, a Company ship is nearing the planet. The prisoners try to stick to the plan, but in the confusion, some unexpectedly bump into each other; David (Pete Postlethwaite) successfully traps the Alien, but it backtracks, corners and kills him. When the beast finally crosses the mold, Ripley hastily prevents Eric (Niall Buggy) from activating the piston in a panic. Dillon enters the tunnels, and finds Kevin (Phil Davis) in the clutches of the Alien. He pulls him away, luring the Alien with them back towards the mold. Kevin dies, but the Alien does not take the bait: it does not enter the mold, but instead grabs Kevin's body and pulls it back into the tunnel. Eric again panics and activates the piston, meaning they have only five minutes to get the Alien back into the mold before the piston shuts it off. Prisoner Jude (Vincenzo Nicoli) makes an attempt, but the Alien grabs him before they can enter the mold. Meanwhile, the Company ship has arrived and several people enter the complex. Aaron receives them; one man immediately asks about Ripley. Aaron explains she is in the furnace. A man with sunglasses enters, followed by a group of people with a steel cage for the beast.Morse runs through a tunnel, bumping into Gregor (Peter Guinness). They joke about the scare it gave them, but the Alien uses their lapse in attention to grab and kill Gregor. Ripley, having found two more dead inmates, enters the tunnel, sends Morse away and taunts the Alien to follow her. Together with Dillon, she finally lures the Alien into the piston. Morse closes the last door, finally trapping the beast in the mold, and runs back up to man the lead platform. Ripley intends to stay in the mold, as she wants to die anyway, but Dillon pulls her with him, stating her promise that the Alien should die before Ripley. They both climb up, but notice the Alien is following them up as well. Dillon decides to stay in the mold to keep the Alien there, comforting Ripley that God will take care of her now. Dillon sacrifices himself by wrestling with the Alien in the mold. Ripley climbs out, and as Dillon's final cry echoes, Morse dumps the hot lead on Ripley's command, completely submerging the creature. Morse cheers, but the lead fails to kill the Alien as it bursts out of the mold, now enraged. It makes for Ripley, who climbs a series of chains to get away from it, but it begins to scramble up after her. Suddenly, Morse shouts to Ripley and reminds her of the sprinkler system hanging above her. Ripley triggers it and dumps cold water over the Alien. The sudden cooling immediately causes cracks and breaks to appear over the Alien, until it finally explodes.Ripley climbs up onto Morse's platform, which hovers above the furnace. When she looks up, she is confronted by Aaron who brought the Company medics and soldiers. The man with the sunglasses moves to the front, and Ripley recognizes him as Bishop (Lance Henriksen). He speaks soothingly to her and tells her that he is not the Bishop android, but rather its human designer, sent by the Company to ensure Ripley's safe return. He tells her that the medic team is there to remove the embryo from her in a simple surgical procedure that will save her life. Ripley asks him what they intend to do with the Alien embryo once it is removed, and Bishop II promises her that they will destroy it, as its cannot be allowed to live. Ripley, however, will be unconscious so she will have to trust them. Ripley gives it some thought, but she knows that the Company really can't be trusted. She closes the fence that separates Morse and herself from the rest of them. Morse moves the platform away from the others and one of the soldiers immediately shoots him in the leg. In response, Aaron hits Bishop II in the back with a lead pipe; the soldiers lethally shoot Aaron. Bishop II, wounded and dazed, yells that he is not a droid, and, as red blood gushes from his wound, begs Ripley not to ruin his chances for studying the alien: It's a magnificent specimen! You must let me have it! he shouts at her. Ripley asks Morse to help her one more time, and he moves the platform out over the boiling blast furnace. Walking to the edge, she summons up her strength and drops herself backwards into the furnace, taking her own life. On the way down, the Queen Alien erupts from her chest, but Ripley holds tightly onto it, dragging it with her into the furnace. Ripley's body is finally immersed in the flames.Empty-handed, the Company medics bandage Morse's wound and take him along with them when they leave, abandoning the penal colony on Fiorina 161. During a final pass by the crashed EEV, we hear the radio picking up Ripley's final transmission from the end of the first movie, decades before: This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off. A final Company message screen shows that the Fury 161 colony is to be closed, and its equipment sold as scrap.End credits.

title: Bloodsport
synopsis: The movie begins with montages of various hopeful competitors training and practicing their fighting techniques. Interspersed with these montages are shots of the arena where the Kumite will be held. The hosts of the Kumite are rehearsing pageantry and preparing the arena for proper use.Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), an army captain at his base, is summoned to a meeting with his colonel before going on furlough. The colonel has found out he plans to travel to Hong Kong while on furlough, and Dux's superiors want to stop him from entering the Kumite, in part because the Kumite is an illegal, underground fight. It is not sanctioned by world martial arts organizations, due to its particularly violent nature. Fatalities, though uncommon and frowned on, are considered part of the risk. Dux stages a daring escape from his base, going AWOL to travel to Hong Kong. The Army dispatches two MPs, Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) to find Dux and bring him back.Dux first visits the home of his mentor and teacher, Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao). He is greeted warmly by Mrs. Tanaka (Lily Leung), who goes to tell her husband that Dux has arrived. Waiting in the living room, Dux becomes lost in thought looking at Tanaka's katana (samurai sword). He begins reminiscing about his long relationship with Tanaka: As a youth, Frank fell in with two unruly boys who made him come with them to try and steal the sword. The boys ran at the sound of people approaching, but Frank started to put the sword back on its stand when he was found by Tanaka and his son, Shingo. Tanaka admonished Dux for stealing, and Dux protested he wasn't going to steal it. Tanaka slices the visor off of Dux's baseball cap and is impressed that Dux didn't even flinch. Meeting with Dux's parents, he convinces them to let him train Frank in martial arts. At first, the young Dux becomes frustrated that he is only learning some of Tanaka's knowledge while Shingo is being trained far more intensively. Shingo is being groomed to represent his family in the Kumite as an adult. But tragedy strikes when Shingo dies as a young adult. A heartbroken Tanaka, having already lost his first family in Hiroshima, chooses to stop all training, believing his family is ended. Dux makes an impassioned plea for Tanaka to train him fully, to compete in the Kumite on Shingo's behalf, to honor both Shingo and Tanaka. Montages are shown of this training, becoming more and more intensive, until at the pinnacle, Dux is able to ignore pain and operate while blindfolded as if still fully sighted.Dux goes to see Tanaka, who is now an old man and showing the infirmities of old age. He tells Dux that when he fights, Tanaka's spirit will be there, fighting beside him, and in the Kumite, he will need it.Dux arrives at the hotel where most of the Kumite participants are staying. He meets Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) playing a karate video game. The two play the game together and start to bond as friends and as fellow Americans. Jackson is a big, brawny, beer-swilling brawler with a scruffy beard. Not knowing anything of Dux, he likes the smaller man and treats him almost like a 'little brother.'Also at the same hotel, an American journalist named Janice Kent (Leah Ayres) is questioning two men about the kumite. She knows it is being held in Hong Kong over the next three days and is trying to get a story on it. The two men don't acknowledge even knowing what the kumite is.Helmer and Rawlins arrive at the Tanaka home to find out if Dux was there and if the Tanakas knew he was going to Hong Kong. Mrs. Tanaka says that Dux came by to pay his respects, but she doesn't know if he was heading to Hong Kong. Rawlins is sure she does know and tries to press her, but Helmer steps in, simply thanking Mrs. Tanaka for speaking to them.Dux and Jackson go to check in at their hotel and are told that a Victor Lin is looking to speak to them. Lin (Ken Siu) comes across Dux and Jackson at that moment and introduces himself, saying he is one of the Kumite agents and he's been assigned to assist them with their stay in Hong Kong. He leads them through the streets of the city to a run-down, seedy part of the city (no man's land, as Lin calls it), explaining that the Kumite is being held in Hong Kong at the permission of the Triad, the Chinese Mafia. At the entrance to a back alley being guarded by several tall, burly, stoic men. Victor speaks to them in Chinese, and the tallest of the guards, their leader, lets them all through with a condescending air toward the American foreigners. Victor leads them through the alley to the secret arena where the Kumite will be held. The first step is to properly register for the Kumite. Participation is by invitation only. As Jackson and Dux present their invitations, the officials stop and are very dubious of Dux, because his invitation lists him as being part of the Tanaka Clan. Clearly they know of Senzo Tanaka and are unwilling to believe, at face value, that Dux is a student of Tanaka's. They insist he prove this claim with a demonstration of the legendary Dim Mak pressure point strike. They show him where several bricks are stacked. To properly demonstrate the Dim Mak, Dux must shatter the bottom-most brick without damaging either of the two bricks stacked atop it. As all the other participants in the arena watch, Dux successfully demonstrates the Dim Mak. The officials accept Dux as authentic and complete his registration. The Kumite participants resume training and sparring, except for one-- a large, burly Chinese man named Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) who is not impressed, warning Dux, Bricks don't hit back.Helmer and Rawlins go to the Hong Kong police department and confer with Inspector Chen (Philip Chan). They give him a photo of Dux, explain that they are trying to stop him from competing in the Kumite, and they ask Chen to contact them if his men learn anything about Dux's whereabouts. Chen is very dismissive but tells the two MP's that he'll see what he can do.Back at the hotel, Dux and Jackson find Janice Kent trying to get a story on the Kumite from one of the participants, a Mid-Eastern fighter named Hossein (Bernard Mariano). Hossein and his friends are surly and condescending. Hossein is only willing to speak if he can take Janice to bed, a proposition she finds repulsive. Hossein is offended at her defiance and is about to slap her when Dux and Jackson intervene. Jackson is ready to melee, but Dux asks everyone if it's worth getting ejected from the Kumite over a woman. Despite Janice's indignant protests, Dux arranges an alternative contest-- he puts a coin in Hossein's hand and challenges him to close his hand into a fist around the coin before Dux can successfully snatch the coin out of his palm. Hossein is amused and overly cocky at the challenge, but the smirk is wiped off his face when Dux succeeds in grabbing the coin. Per the terms of the bet, Hossein and his friends have to leave Janice alone.Dux and Janice are talking as they take a walk, and Janice tells Dux about her ambition to get a story on the Kumite, which she describes as 'a cockfight, except with people.' Dux agrees te speak to Janice, and asks her to dinner in return.The first day of the Kumite arrives, and the opening pageantry is conducted and the host organization introduces itself, speaking about the traditional background of the contest.As the Kumite prepares for the first fight, Victor reminds Dux and Jackson that the contests are full-contact, and there are three ways to win-- knock the opponent out, knock them off the platform, or force the opponent to shout the word Matte, which is a cry of surrender similar to saying 'Uncle.'The first-round bouts are conducted, showing several participants standing out as victorious and forces to be reckoned with -- a Polynesian fighter named Parades (Michel Qissi), a Chinese kung-fu fighter named Chuan Ip Mung (Dennis Chu), a big and burly Japanese Sumo fighter named Pumola (David Ho), a Muay Thai kickboxer named Paco (Paulo Tocha), Jackson, and Chong Li, who is the current champion. Chong Li exults in hearing the crowd cheer his name, and enjoys finishing his matches by maiming and crippling his opponents. He is notorious for having killed a participant at the last Kumite. Chong Li easily dispatches his opponent, breaking his own world record for the fastest knockout.Dux's first opponent is none other than Hossein. The Syrian fighter is eager for a little revenge, but Dux not only knocks him out, but proceeds to break Chong Li's new record for fastest knockout in so doing-- and Chong Li is noticeably angered.Helmer and Rawlins are eating lunch when Inspector Chen comes to see them. He's found out the name of the hotel Dux is staying at. Helmer and Rawlins confront Dux in the lounge there as he is talking with Jackson. They pull taser stun-guns and order him to come with them immediately. A football tackle by Jackson takes them down and gives Dux time to run. He leads them on an amusing chase scene, seemingly toying with them before giving them the slip.Dux meets with Janice that evening for dinner. He tells her a little about the Kumite, but insists she cannot truly understand it without seeing it-- and the Kumite doesn't allow just anyone in, even as spectators-- they are especially strict about keeping press out. Janice asks Dux to pull some strings to let her come in and watch. She even sleeps with him as an incentive (and because she likes him). In the morning he kisses her goodbye and tells her that he cannot get her inside. But Janice quickly finds another way of entry, going undercover posing as a date to a wealthy patron.A number of Kumite bouts are shown, and Dux, Chong Li, Chuan Ip Mung, Pumola, and Paco stand out, eliminating various opponents. Chong Li fights Parades, whose longer reach lets him land various combination punches that jar Chong Li. But Chong Li adopts a counter-punching strategy and gets inside, landing brutal attacks that leave Parades completely dazed and stunned. Playing to the crowd, Chong Li executes a brutal stomping kick to his opponent's kneecap, breaking Parades' leg and presumably crippling him.More fights are shown, and more fighters are eliminated. Dux defeats Pumola by doing a split to get under Pumola's charge, and punching his groin. The crowd begins to chant Dux's name, which really gets Chong Li angry.Ray Jackson finds himself facing Chong Li. Jackson is remarkably confident and arrogant, and shrugs off warnings of caution from both Dux and Victor. Dux has noticed a weakness in Chong Li's fighting style-- Parades almost turned the tables on him by landing a stiff punch to Chong Li's belly. Dux advises Jackson to focus on punches to the stomach, and warns Jackson to stay away from Chong Li's right leg. Jackson brushes off the warnings and advice, saying he has everything under control.As the fight begins, Jackson pounds on Chong Li's head with several hammering blows that drive him to one knee. Jackson then turns away, thinking he has the fight in the bag, and plays to the crowd, trying to get them to chant his name the way they chant Chong Li's name. From ringside, Dux tries to call out to Jackson to focus on finishing Chong Li, who is still on one knee, nursing his bruises and recovering. But by the time Jackson turns back to face Chong Li, the burly Chinese fighter has risen back to his feet and is ready to show the whole crowd what happens to people who try to make a mockery of him. Chong Li lands a devastating kick that turns the tide of battle in a heartbeat. Not satisfied with merely defeating Jackson, Chong Li lets his rage bubble to the surface and delivers a frighteningly brutal stomp to the head of his prone opponent, as Victor struggles to hold Dux back from intervening. Jackson is unconscious and bleeding profusely from his mouth as Chong Li pulls off Jackson's biker bandanna and claims it as a trophy, shaking it in front of Dux as a dire warning.At the hospital, Jackson is being examined by doctors. Dux speaks to the unconscious Jackson, telling him he's lucky to have such a hard head, which saved him from being permanently maimed. Dux vows to get revenge on Chong Li. Janice is there as well, and she is horrified at the personal vendetta. The two argue passionately outside the hospital. Dux points out Janice's career as a reporter, and she is trying to be the best she can be-- Dux is doing the same; to be the best fighter he can be. Seeing she cannot budge Dux, Janice resignedly shouts that she only hopes Dux doesn't end up in a similar state as Jackson-- or even worse, before storming off. Lin goes up to Dux and admonishes him to forget Janice, as well as Jackson's injury and also about revenge. Dux has the chance to become the first fighter from the Western hemisphere to ever win the Kumite, but he needs to have a clear head.Desperate to see Dux spared from grievous injury, Janice turns to Inspector Chen. Knowing that the Kumite is illegal under Hong Kong law, Janice hopes to see the police get involved in stopping the competition. Inspector Chen is again dismissive, until Janice gives him Dux's name.Riding a bus back to his hotel, Dux is haunted by memories of the bout and mistakenly thinks he sees Chong Li's reflection in the bus window, glaring at him.Walking through the back alley for the final rounds of competition, Dux finds he has to fight his way through a gauntlet of Inspector Chen's police officers. After getting past them, he finds Helmer and Rawlins waiting at the doors to the arena with Chen and Janice. Helmer and Rawlins have their taser stun-guns at the ready. Dux uses a trash can lid to deflect the taser darts and grabs their weapons away. Knowing they cannot take Dux hand to hand, Helmer disgustedly enters the arena with Rawlins and Janice to observe the final bouts, hoping they do not have to scrape Dux up off the floor.In the arena, the officials are unaware of what is going on outside-- only that as a result of the melee, Dux is extremely late in showing up. They are just about to disqualify him when Dux enters.Dux's semifinal match is against Paco. As the fight begins, Paco extends his fists, motioning for Dux to touch knuckles with him. Warily, Dux finally does so, and is hit by a cheap shot from Paco. Recovering, Dux wades into battle and knocks Paco out.Chong Li's semi-final opponent is Chuan Ip Mung. Chuan gives Chong Li the stiffest resistance he's encountered in the Kumite, but even he cannot withstand the power of Chong Li's blows. Chong Li has Chuan supine and barely conscious on the ground, and starts to play to the crowd. But then, looking to send a message to Dux, Chong Li grabs Chuan's head and brutally snaps his neck. The crowd falls completely silent as the referee feels for breath and looks at Chong Li in appalled shock. Chuan is dead.The officials all stand and turn their backs to Chong Li, facing the wall and bowing their heads in a moment of silence. To Chong Li's disappointment the whole crowd, including Helmer, Rawlins and Janice, follow suit. Chong Li warns Dux that he is next, and Dux just glares back before joining the rest of the crowd in the moment of silence.As Chong Li prepares for the final bout, his trainer (Wilson Lee) carefully and stealthily slips a small chunk of a chalky substance into the waistband of his trunks. (Hinted to be cocaine but not stated definitively)Dux and Chong Li step onto the platform for the final bout to determine the Kumite's champion. Chong Li points to Jackson's bandanna, which he has tied around his calf, saying he plans to break Dux in return for Dux's breaking his record. Dux stares back unafraid.The bout begins and Dux quickly seizes initiative. He takes control following the advice he tried to give Jackson, focusing on repeated punches and kicks to Chong Li's stomach and watching for kicks from Chong Li's right leg. He knocks Chong Li down, staggering him. On one knee, using his body to shield the action, Chong Li carefully removes the chalky object from his trunks and crushes it into a powder in his hand. Rising to his feet, he throws a punch that falls well short of his mark but, unseen by everyone else, flings the powder right into Dux's eyes. Aside from his vision being completely clouded over, Dux appears to fall into a near stupor. The tables are turned and Chong Li takes the opportunity to enjoy beating Dux from pillar to post.On the mat, screaming in frustration, Dux suddenly clears his mind and appears to go into a meditative trance. Flashbacks are shown of his training with Tanaka, including training where he is blindfolded and learns to operate through his other senses as if he were fully sighted. Dux blocks a punch to his head and throws a ground side kick to Chong Li's stomach. Rising to his feet, Dux begins to step carefully around the arena, but always able to fend off Chong Li's attacks and land more blows to his stomach. Chong Li tries to throw Dux off by pushing the referee into him, but Dux, grabbing a handful of the ref's tunic, recognizes the ploy and carefully eases the referee behind him. He takes control of the match, hammering Chong Li's stomach and then going up to the head with leaping, spinning wheel kicks that knock the burly Chong Li completely for a loop.Dux refuses to settle for a mere knockout. He needs to establish absolute dominance-- meaning even Chong Li himself must declare it to the whole crowd. Dux grabs Chong Li's head and gradually twists his neck, shouting, Say it! He twists Chong Li's neck harder until it is clear that his neck will snap if he doesn't comply. With his very life on the line, Chong Li defeatedly shouts 'matte,' and the crowd goes wild as the referee gestures to signal Dux's victory.The closing ceremony shows the officials presenting Dux with a beautifully crafted Japanese katana with words of praise. The whole crowd, including Helmer, Rawlins and Janice, applaud as Dux looks up to the ceiling and says quietly, This is for you, Shidoshi.Dux and Janice visit Jackson at the hospital. Jackson has regained consciousness and is convalescing. He is notably impressed as Dux's victory-- forcing Chong Li to submit, no less-- but jokingly warns that Dux might have to fight him next time. Dux and Jackson give an emotional handshake, their bond having strengthened to near blood-brothers.Helmer and Rawlins are waiting at the airport in front of a plane to take Dux back to the United States. They wait, and finally they are convinced that Dux has given them the slip yet again. Suddenly they hear a whistle behind them and turn to see Dux just inside the plane's boarding doorway, telling them to hurry up. The two MP's are grudgingly amused as they board the plane.Just as Dux is about to re-enter the plane, a cab pulls up and Janice steps out. Looking up at Dux, she gives him the Chinese covered-fist salute. The camera freezes on Dux returning the salute and bowing his head to her. Captions proceed to give Dux's career fight stats in the Kumite over several years, saying he established four records that were still standing at the time of the movie's release, and that he retired undefeated, before establishing his own martial arts school. Fade out as the credits begin to roll.

title: Animal House
synopsis: In 1962, college freshmen Lawrence Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) seek to join a fraternity at Faber College. They visit the prestigious Omega Theta Pi House's invitational party, but are not welcomed there. They then try next door at Delta Tau Chi House, where Kent's brother was once a member, making Kent a legacy. There they find John Bluto Blutarsky (John Belushi) urinating outside the fraternity house. The Deltas need the dues so they permit Larry and Kent to pledge. They receive the fraternity names Pinto (Larry) and Flounder (Kent).Vernon Wormer (John Vernon), dean of Faber College, wants to remove the Delta fraternity from campus due to repeated conduct violations and low academic standing. Since they are already on probation, he puts the Deltas on something he calls double secret probation and orders the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) to find a way to get rid of the Deltas permanently.Flounder is bullied by Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), so Bluto and Daniel Simpson D-Day Day (Bruce McGill) persuade Flounder to sneak Neidermeyer's horse into Dean Wormer's office late at night. They give him a gun and tell him to shoot it. Unbeknownst to Flounder, the gun is loaded with blanks. Unable to bring himself to kill the horse, he fires into the ceiling. The noise frightens the horse so much that it dies of a heart attack.In the cafeteria the next day, smooth-talking Eric Otter Stratton (Tim Matheson) tries to convince the stuck-up Mandy Pepperidge (Mary Louise Weller) to abandon her boyfriend, the uninteresting Marmalard, and date him instead. Bluto proceeds to provoke Marmalard with his impression of a popping zit by stuffing his mouth with a scoop of mashed potatoes and propelling it at Marmalard and table mates, Chip Diller (Kevin Bacon) and Barbara Babs Jansen (Martha Smith). Bluto then starts a food fight that engulfs the cafeteria.Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming psychology test, but it turns out the Omegas planted the exam stencil and the Deltas get every answer wrong. Their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer needs only one more incident to revoke the charter that allows them to remain on campus.To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party, during which Otis Day and the Knights perform Shout. The dean's alcoholic, lecherous wife, Marion (Verna Bloom), attends the party at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette (Sarah Holcomb), a girl he met at the supermarket, and makes out with her only to learn she is the mayor's 13-year-old daughter. He later takes her home in a shopping cart. Due to the party, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court with the Omegas and revokes Delta's charter and all belongings are confiscated.To take their minds off their troubles, Otter, Donald Boon Schoenstein (Peter Riegert), Flounder and Pinto go on a road trip. Otter picks up some girls from Emily Dickinson College by pretending to be the fiancé of Fawn Liebowitz, a girl who recently died on campus. They stop at a roadhouse because Otis Day and the Knights are performing there, not realizing that it caters to an exclusively black clientele. The hulking patrons intimidate the guys and they flee, damaging Flounder's borrowed car and leaving their frightened dates behind.Boon breaks up with his girlfriend Katy (Karen Allen) after discovering her sexual relationship with a professor (Donald Sutherland). Marmalard is told that his girlfriend is having an affair with Otter, so he and other Omegas lure him to a motel and beat him up. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all. He even notifies their draft boards of their eligibility. In the process, before Bluto attempts to speak to the dean, Wormer orders Flounder to speak with the words, Well? Out with it!, whereupon Flounder vomits on the dean.It seems time for the Deltas to give up, but Bluto, supported by the injured Otter, rouses them with an impassioned, historically inaccurate speech (Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?!) and they decide to take revenge on Wormer and the Omegas.

title: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
synopsis: In a fire-apple red convertible under the desert sun, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive to Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs. Somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, the drugs begin to take hold...Suddenly Duke notices black bats flying over their heads and around the car, and he tries to kill them with a flyswatter. Holy Jesus, what are these goddamn animals? They pull over and Gonzo takes over driving. 'No point in mentioning these bats', I thought. 'The poor bastard will see them soon enough.' Duke inspects the contents of the case in the trunk: marijuana, mescaline, cocaine, amyls, ether, liquor, LSD, and a huge assortment of other drugs. He takes some of them and they drive off with a dead bat on the road behind them.A report comes on the radio about drugs killing American soldiers, which is quickly changed to One Toke Over The Line by Brewer and Shipley. Gonzo sings the wrong tune. They spot a hitchhiker (Tobey Maguire) and Gonzo begins to pull over, but Duke panics. We can't stop here! This is bat country! They drive back and pick him up nonethless. It turns out he had never been in a convertible before. Is that right? Well, I guess you're about ready then aren't you? We're your friends. We're not like the others man, really, says Gonzo. No more of that talk or I'll put the fucking leeches on you, understand? Says Duke. The hitchhiker is confused, but Duke just smiles at him, cigarette holder clenched in his teeth. Get in.With the hitchhiker in the back seat, they drive on at top speed again. Duke begins to get paranoid that the hitchhiker will think they are part of the Manson family, so he decides to explain the situation. He jumps over the seat and sits beside the nervous hitchhiker. He introduces Dr. Gonzo, his Samoan attorney. They explain how they are going to cover the Mint 400 race and find the American Dream, and the True Story of how they got there.Flash back to them sitting in the Beverly Heights Hotel, where they get a phone call about being assigned to the Mint 400 Race. All they have to do is drive to Vegas, check into their suite, and meet their Portuguese photographer named Lacerda. Gonzo suggests they arm themselves to the teeth. They decide to cover the event through pure Gonzo Journalism. They drive around for a while and argue about the differences between white and Samoan culture. They buy some drugs and shirts, then they haggle over the phone with a salesman for a tape recorder. On their way to the shop, they're delayed en route when a Stingray in front of them kills a pedestrian. Later, they rent a convertible and scare the salesman by driving it backwards at high speeds and stealing his pen. Then they eat some mescaline and go swimming. Our trip was different, it was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character. A gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country, but only for those with True Grit.And we are chock full of that, man! On the road, Gonzo encounters heart troubles and pulls over. The hitchhiker watches each of them take medicinal amyl nitrite and become completely twisted. Gonzo pretends to be completely confused as to why they are in the desert, then they scare the hitchhiker with crazy stories about their plans to murder the drug dealer Savage Henry who ripped them off. I mean what is going on in this country when a scumsucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism, can you tell me that? Suddenly the hitchhiker jumps out the back of the car and runs off, yelling back that they shouldn't worry about him. Duke yells back, Wait a minute! Come back and get a beer! Fuck 'im. I'm gonna miss 'im.Duke takes over driving. We gotta get out of California before that kids finds a cop! Duke takes some acid and Gonzo spills their cocaine. You see what God just did to us, man? God didn't do that, you did it. You're a fucking narcotics agent! I knew it! Duke drives faster so they can make it to the hotel before he completely loses it. They pass a sign that reads: Don't gamble with marijuana: In Nevada, possession = 20 years... sale = life!They reach Las Vegas, at the press sign-in for the Mint 400. Duke is so twisted on acid he can barely deal with the valet who's face begins to morph before his eyes. There is no way of explaining the terror I felt. The carpet in the lobby appears to be made of living vines that are growing up the walls at an alarming rate. Duke sees a desk clerk turn into a poisonous moray eel before his eyes. He freaks out but Gonzo tells the clerk Duke has a bad heart. We have plenty of medicine. They go to a bar and Gonzo suggests they eat some peanuts. Everyone in the lounge is drunk, rowdy and wearing fur coats. Duke is left alone for a minute, the atmosphere of the bar becoming more and more ominous. The floor appears to turn to sticky mud under Duke's shoe. He yells to Gonzo to get some golf shoes, otherwise they'll never get out alive. A bowl of snacks in front of him turns into a bowl of worms; a lizardlike tonque suddenly shoots into the bowl. Duke turns around and everyone in the lounge turns into giant lizards, all humping, slashing and devouring each other. I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo, and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! Suddenly Gonzo returns but his words sound like gibberish to Duke. Please! Tell me you bought the fucking golf shoes! Some of the lounge lizards turn their heads towards Duke. Jesus God Almighty, look at that bunch over there, man! They've spotted us. That's the press table, man. Gonzo collects him so they can sign in with their press credentials. Duke falls off his bar stool.In the hotel room they order an insane amount of food, including a ton of grapefruit, shrimp cocktails and club sandwiches. Duke still tripping on acid starts watching some war footage and sees a big machine in the sky, some kind of electric snake, coming straight at us. Gonzo tells him to shoot it, but he tries to study it's habits instead. Duke has his face so close to the TV that he jumps back when a gunshot goes off. Fuck, I'm hit! Gonzo starts yelling at him about what happened in the lobby, which apparently involved Duke waving around a marlin spike. Duke doesn't remember any of this. You scared the shit out of those people, they were ready to call the cops! Yessir, you're lucky I came back in time! Gonzo goes to the door with his .357 as someone starts knocking. Duke is terrified and tries to hide behind the mini-bar. Lacerda (Craig Bierko), the photographer, enters. They don't trust him. You're not Portuguese, man! yells Duke. He tells them about the race, and in the middle of telling them about all the different types of bikes, the war footage on the TV causes Duke on acid to see Lacerda as a jungle commando for an instant with a crazy look in his eyes and bombs going off around him. He shakes his head and the room returns to normal. Duke and Gonzo stare down Lacerda weirdly, and he leaves. Gonzo thinks Lacerda was lying. I could see it in his eyes! Eyes? says Duke, trying to look at his own eyes. Gonzo becomes fed up with the war footage and rips the TV cord out of the wall.At the race, Duke checks into the press tent where he snorts another amyl and orders a beer. There's some people firing off guns into the desert for no apparent reason. Some guy shakes a dusty rag into Duke's beer. When the race starts, the bikers kick up a lot of dust and make the race impossible to cover. Duke and Lacerda head out in a Jeep to find it, but run into some people with machine guns. Duke convinces them that they are friendlies and they drive off. Duke's beer turns into mud from all the dust in the air. Duke gives up and heads back to the pits, telling Lacerda he is fired.On the strip, Duke and Gonzo debate about how to spend the evening. Gonzo suggests Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. Why should I pay my hard-earned money to watch a fucking corpse? says Duke. They wind up at a Debbie Reynolds concert, and piss off the people working there by parking on the sidewalk. We're friends of Debbie's, says Gonzo. Once they get inside the man tells them there are no seats left. Gonzo threatens the usher with legal action. The man agrees to let them into the concert, but only if they will stand quietly at the back and not smoke. Two seconds after Duke and Gonzo enter the concert, the ushers drag them back out the door, both of them laughing hysterically, and kick them out, knocking over the velvet ropes in the process.In the car, they're still laughing. We wandered into a fucking time capsule, man! says Duke. Gonzo notices one of the ushers has ripped his suit, and he yells back towards the concert hall that he's going to find where the usher lives and burn his house down. One of these days I'll toss a fucking bomb in that place.They head to the Bazooko Circus, because Duke says nobody will mess with them in there. Before going in they huff some ether off an American flag and eat mescaline. Devil ether. It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel. Total loss of all basic motor skills. Blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue, the mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it... The ether makes it almost impossible for them to walk through the turnstiles. Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine... mutters Duke. The men running the entrance help them through.Inside the circus, a team of acrobats is putting on an act where they do a mock birthing midair, using oversized scissors, clamps and a hammer, to a doll in a spacesuit with a big American flag on its chest. Below them, on a large net that seperates the circus from the casino floor below, a trainer grapples with a snarling wolverine that has just bitten in half a white baton. Below the casino floor is sheer mayhem, a bizarre assortment of brightly-colored attractions, games, and people in weird costumes. Duke almost steps on a midget holding a huge stack of money, (Verne Troyer), who immediately disappears into the cloak of a strange, tall woman. Duke describes the scene: Drug users can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But nobody should be asked to handle this trip. This was what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the nazis had won the war. This was the Six Reich. Duke and Gonzo encounter a man (Penn Jillette) who offers to get them whatever message they want played on a huge screen over downtown. You'll be 200 feet tall! Another man yells that they can shoot the pasties off the nipples of the ten foot bull dyke and win a cotton candy goat! Freaked out by the things they see in the circus, like the human dartboard (live victim?), and a monkey dressed like a doctor, they stop at a rotating bar.The mescaline finally hits them. Duke theorizes that this is the 'main nerve' of the American Dream. Gonzo begins to lose it. I think I'm getting the Fear. Oh look, says Duke. There's uh, two women fucking a polar bear! Don't tell me these things, says Gonzo. Not now man. He says he has to leave the country. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody! Duke agrees to lend him some money to leave. Gonzo starts talking with a waitress: Did they pay you to screw that bear? The waitress gets pissed off and tells them to leave. They try but Gonzo is too paranoid to step off the bar because it's rotating. Duke goes all the way around the bar, briefly losing Gonzo as Gonzo awkwardly holds onto the support bar and tries to drag his feet over the edge. People start watching them. Hop! Hop! Quick, like a bunny! Gonzo can't move until Duke kicks him from behind and he falls off the bar. Duke tells him to hurry up. Come on, you fiend! Fine you stay here and go to jail. I'm leaving. As they are leaving Gonzo yells that some sonofabitch just kicked him in the back. Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress. Gonzo starts yelling about cows and bisexuals trying to kill him. Where's the elevator? No, fuck! says Duke. That's just what they want us to do. Trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement. Don't run man. They'd like any excuse to shoot us. Gonzo tells Duke that Duke should probably drive on the way back. I think there's something wrong with me. Gonzo falls over.They escape back to their hotel room with some effort. The door is apparently locked but Duke pushes it open with a cart. Gonzo flashes some knives around and threatens to harm Lacerda. The story flashes back to the elevator where Gonzo confronts Lacerda over the attentions of a pretty blonde reporter (Cameron Diaz). Lacerda laughs when Duke tells a TV crew they work for Vincent Black Shadow. Gonzo scares Lacerda by pulling a knife on him. Back in the room, Gonzo is convinced the blonde reporter fell in love with him on the spot. He threatens Duke over him and Lacerda, asking if Duke put Lacerda up to the reporter. Duke tells him to get his head straight. One of the things you learns from years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye. He leaves and broods over the meaning of his trip to Las Vegas, and some early morning gamblers who are still chasing the American dream. He gambles on the wheel of chance and loses, but learns to enjoy it.Back in the room, which is now so filled with food carts that Duke can barely open the door, he finds Gonzo on a lot of acid and sitting in the bathtub in his underwear. Gonzo makes him put Jefferson Airplane on. When Duke leaves, Gonzo tries to grab the tape recorder and electrocute himself. Duke uses the shower curtain rod to keep his lawyer at bay. He threatens Duke with a knife if he doesn't kill him when the song White Rabbit peaks. Duke tells him he will, and when the song reaches the climax he throws a grapefruit at his head, unplugs the tape machine, runs out of the bathroom, grabs a can of mace and tries to hide under a cardboard box. Gonzo chases him out of the bathroom and tries to attack him with a knife, but Duke holds him back with the can of mace. Duke threatens to call the police, because he doesn't want Gonzo wandering around on acid and wanting to slice him up. Who said anything about slicing you up, man? Gonzo says. I just wanted to carve a little Z in your forehead... Gonzo starts laughing, but Duke is indignant. Please, I need some fucking rest man, please. He chases Gonzo back into the bathroom by yelling at him through a megaphone. He locks the door, jams it with a chair and goes to the couch, lighting a pipe. Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom. Just another ugly refugee from the love generation. The couch begins to float towards the ceiling as Duke remembers something...Flashback to 1965, in a club called The Matrix. There I was... Jesus, there I am! says Duke, upon seeing himself in flashback (Hunter S. Thompson). A roadie (Lyle Lovett) comes in yelling Anybody want some LSD? He has all the makings of LSD with him, he just needs a place to cook. Later Duke takes some of his product into the washroom. I decided to eat only half of the acid at first, but I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red woolen shirt. Suddenly the bass player (Flea) from the band enters the washroom, speaking in very slow motion... What's the trouble? Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve... is LSD. Suddenly a yuppie comes into the room, just in time to see the bass player sucking the LSD off Duke's sleeve with great enthusiasm. He immediately bolts. With a bit of luck, his life was ruined forever. Always thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars, men in red woolen shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know.Back in the hotel room, Duke goes to the window, thinking about the end of the 60's acid wave and the crash that followed. Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Has it been five years? Six? It seems like a lifetime, the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world. Whatever it meant... There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.The next morning Gonzo is gone and the room service bill is in the thousands. Duke threatens the room service waiter with a gun before signing the bill on his face. Duke takes off with his suitcase of drugs and doesn't pay the hotel a dime. His paranoia increasing, he reaches his car outside but is suddenly stopped by a man from the hotel (Gregory Itzin). Convinced that he's going to prison, he all but gives up until the man gives him a telegram, addressed to a Mr. Thompson (Duke's real name). Duke promises to get that telegram to Thompson right away. The man asks him when Dr. Gonzo will be awake, obviously wanting to talk to him about the massive hotel bill. What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles when we knew he was right here in the hotel. That telegram is actually all scrambled, it's actually FROM Thompson, not to him! says Duke, trying to confuse the man even more and escape the situation. I've got to go. I've gotta get to the race! But there's no hurry, the race is over. Not for me, says Duke, driving away.Duke drives off, trying to escape the city limits. He starts praying to God that he can just get rid of his car full of felonies and off the horrible desert. No sooner has he said this that a highway patrol car pulls up behind him and hits its siren. You better take care of me Lord, because if you don't, you're gonna have me *on your hands!*Most speeders will immediately panic and pull over to the side. This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop-heart. Make the bastard chase you, he will follow. He turns it into a high-speed chase and makes a sharp turn that spins the cop out. He pulls over and is confronted by the cop (Gary Busey). Duke still has a can of beer in his hand, and realizes he's probably fucked. The cop questions the contents of his car, including two cases of soap. I want to stay clean, replies Duke. The cop figured Duke just needs a nap, and tells him to get some sleep in the next rest area. He recommends the seafood in Baker. He also wants a kiss from him. When Duke gets to Baker, he sees the hitchhiker, panics and drives the other way. He calls Gonzo from a payphone, because the bastards are closing in! He reminds Duke to read the telegram, which explains that his new assignment is the National District Attorneys Conference On Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in Vegas. Duke pretends the call is all a joke and that he's already checked in.Duke fires off some shots randomly from the .357 into the desert. He decides he has no choice but the go to the conference. All energy flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet. What a fool I was to defy him.He rents a new Cadillac, with his credit card still technically valid. Now this was a superior machine. Ten grand worth of gimmicks and high-priced special effects. The rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond. The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that I would never understand.He drives to the Flamingo where the conference is held. If the pigs were gathering in Vegas, I felt the drug culture should be represented as well. And there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas hotel, and then just wheeling across town and checking into another. Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over America. Why not? Move confidently into their midst.He walks into the hotel surrounded by cops waving batons, with a suitcase packed with drugs in his hand. In his mind they all turn and stare right at him as he enters. My arrival was badly timed, he says, wiping some cocaine from under his nose. In the lobby an angry police chief haggles with the clerk over his room. The clerk (Christopher Meloni) keeps telling him that his reservation has been moved to a different hotel. Duke narrates that he can hear what the clerk is really saying to the cop: Listen you fuzzy little shithead! I've been fucked around in my time by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered, rule-crazy cops, and now it's my turn. So *fuck you* officer, *I'm* in charge! Sensing a kindred spirit, Duke squeezes through and checks in in front of them, even becoming good friends with the desk clerk, Sven. The chief's wife bawls her eyes out. The chief continues to haggle with Sven.When he gets to the room, he is immediately attacked by a young painter named Lucy (Christina Ricci) who Gonzo met on the plane. Gonzo, dressed in what appears to be a bedsheet folded to look like Christ's robes, gets her away from Duke by whipping her with a towel. This is my client, Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. Lucy eyes Duke warily but doesn't attack him again. Gonzo explains that Lucy is a Christian artist and apparently a big fan of Barbara Streisand. She came all the way out from Montana to show her paintings to Barbara herself during a concert. An entire half of the room is filled with paintings of various sizes, every one of them of Barbara Streisand. I desperately needed peace. Rest. Sanctuary. I hadn't counted on this, narrates Duke. Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship. Realizing that Gonzo has likely engaged in statutory rape, along with giving drugs to a minor, Duke suggests with pig-Latin and some arm movements to talk with Gonzo privately in the hall. Lucy gives him the one-finger Jesus-freak salute as him and Gonzo leave. God bless.Alright, listen. In a few hours she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into some kind of towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan, who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her into a Vegas hotel room, and then savagely penetrated every orifice in her little body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member! That's so ugly man, says Gonzo. Fuck. Truth hurts, replies Duke. He suggests they keep her on drugs and use her as a sex slave to make money off the cops, the alternative being Gonzo going to jail. Finally they decide to pay a cab driver to drive her to the Tropicana, and they also pay for a room there, telling her she's going to meet Barbara Streisand, hoping she wouldn't remember what happened. I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done. Gonzo says they should find a nice seafood restaurant. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon.Gonzo pukes from mescaline and red salmon. Goddamn mescaline. Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?They go to the conference and hear a man (Michael Jeter) talk about some bizarre theories on marijuana, including marijuana smokers calling a joint butt a 'roach' because it resembles a cockroach. Gonzo leaves when a joke about Margaret Mead prompts the entire conference of pudgy, white cops to start laughing hysterically. A video comes on explaining how marijuana users should be taken down with all necessary force. Realizing that the conference is a waste of time, Duke gets up quietly and leaves.In their room, they get a call from Sven that Lucy had left them a message. Duke has a sudden terrifying thought: He and Gonzo, on trial in a cartoonish courtroom shrouded in black on all sides, both locked in a steel cage with giant shackles on their hands and feet. Lucy is in the witness stand, with both her and the judge (Harry Dean Stanton) towering over the helpless defendants. They gave me the LSD and they took me to the hotel, says Lucy, sorrowfully. I don't know what they done to me, but I remember, it was horrible. They gave you what? says the judge. L.. S... D. CASTRATION! Exclaims the judge. Duke crosses his legs in pain upon hearing the sentence. DOUBLE CASTRATION! The judge chops two walnuts in half, using a hatchet instead of a gavel.Back in the real world, Duke panics and starts packing to go back to LA. Gonzo decides to handle the situation, by calling Lucy and telling her he stomped Duke and pulled his teeth out. Meanwhile Duke swallows some adrenochrome that Gonzo got off a Satanist client. He takes way too much and starts making these EEeeeeeeeEEEEeeee noises while wearing an orange towel on his head. Gonzo stomps and yells, pretending to be arrested over the phone, then hangs up. Well, that's the last we should be hearing from Lucy, man. Duke thinks for a second that Gonzo had gone crazy and actually thought he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again... Gonzo suggests they get some opium.Duke slumps on the bed, the room becoming more and more pink and intense. I think there's only one source for this stuff. The, uh, adrenaline gland... from a living... human... body! I know, says Gonzo. The guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He offered me human blood, said it would take me higher than I'd ever been in my life. I thought he was kidding... so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome... or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland... to chew on. Gonzo explains that he didn't dare turn the Satanist down for legal counsel. He might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal gland. You know. The drug becoming more intense, Duke suggests they eat a big handful of pineal gland extract and see what happens. Yeah, that's a good idea, says Gonzo. One whiff of that stuff will turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia man... Suddenly Duke sees Gonzo turn into a dancing demon with six hairy breasts on his back and discuss the effects of the extract of the human pineal gland on the brain. Your head would swell up like a watermelon. You'd gain about a hundred pounds in two hours. Grow claws, bleeding warts. And then you'd notice about six huge, hairy tits swelling up on your back. You'd go blind. Your body would turn to wax. They'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow. And when you scream for help...you'll sound like a raccoon.Gonzo returns to normal. Man I'll try just about anything, but I'd never in hell touch a pineal gland. Duke yells at him to finish the story. What happened? What about the *glands*? Gonzo tells him that he looks like he's about to explode. Duke suggests Gonzo shove him into the pool, as he suddenly has an urge to go swimming. If I put you in the pool right now you'll sink like a goddamn stone. You took too much man, you took too much too much... Gonzo tells him not to fight it, or he'll get a stroke. Duke tries to crawl across the room. l llama es un quadrupedo, he mutters. He sees Nixon floating out of the TV chanting sacrifice before he passes out under an American flag.When he wakes up he has a microphone tied to his head and is wearing fishing boots and a strap-on lizard tail. The room is totally destroyed with drugs, food and everything imaginable all over the place. Part of the room is flooded with some sort of brown water and the bed looks like it was blown up. There's a .357 magnum in the toilet. How many nights and weird mornings had this shit been going on? There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 AD.Duke flashes back to him and Gonzo scaring the maid (Jenette Goldstein) with a microphone gun. She walked in on Gonzo polishing his shoes (vomiting on them) in the closet. They convince her that they are cops looking for drug smugglers and that she shouldn't tell anyone about what she saw and not to send any other maids, just to leave some towels by the door. They tell her if she tells anyone she'll go straight to prison for the rest of her life. They even hire her as a part time agent for a detective named Arthur Rocks, with them paying her for receiving one phone call every day. Duke tells her, When you hear the password 'one hand washes the other', you say 'I fear nothing!'. I fear nothing. SAY IT AGAIN! I FEAR NOTHING! Very good!Duke attempts to listen to tape recordings to figure out what had happened. Terrible gibberish. Splintered memories looming up out of the time-fog. Just press play.Flashback to Duke telling the monkey man at the rotating bar about his theory that the bar is the nerve center of the American dream. Yeah. Welcome to the happy place, the monkey man says sarcastically. Let's get down to brass tacks. How much for the ape? says Duke. How much do you think you'd take for the ape? Just wait here, I'll be back.Several flashbacks are intertwined: Duke and Gonzo smashing coconuts over the hood of the Cadillac with hammers while a crowd of people stares at them, and Duke yells things like You people voted for Hubert Humphries, and you killed Jesus!; The top of the Cadillac getting completely jammed and broken; Duke returning to the rotating bar while it apparently breaks down and catches fire; the monkey man trying to keep the animal away from Duke after it possibly got a hold of some drugs and attacked people. There was every reason to believe that we'd been heading for trouble... that we'd pushed our luck a bit too far.Duke struggles across the hotel room to a makeshift shrine to Debbie Reynolds surrounded by Christmas lights. He starts recording: The possibility... of physical and mental collapse... is now very real. No sympathy for the devil. Keep that in mind. Uh, buy the ticket... take the ride.Flashback to Gonzo and Duke driving, Gonzo barely coherent on drugs, possibly crying, scaring motorists with offers of pure fucking smack with vomit smeared down the side of the Cadillac. The people in the other car try to ignore him, but one of them goes crazy and starts pounding on the window: Goddammit you bastards! Pull over, I'll kill you I'll kill you, pull over, come on!Back in the room, Duke tries to unjam the tape recorder, with what he finds is a knife crusted with what appears to be blood. The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.In another flashback, Gonzo tries making a pass at a waitress (Ellen Barkin) working alone at a cafe in the northern outskirts of Vegas. He passes her a napkin that reads: Back door beauty? with the question mark emphasized. What is this? That's the name of a horse I used to own, ma'am, says Gonzo, but the waitress isn't buying it. I know what that means you fat goddamn pimp bastard! She spits in his face and threatens to call the cops, prompting Gonzo to pull out a hunting knife and cut the phone receiver off. The waitress is scared stiff. Gonzo buys a whole lemon meringue pie, stuffs the money into the waitress's shirt, and leaves. Duke follows, but leaves his plate of food. The terrified waitress cries. The knife had stirred up some bad memories. The glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut. She was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.Duke drives Gonzo to the airport. (Still in flashback.) Our only hope I felt was the possiblity that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in a position to bring the hammer down on us could possibly believe it. On the way to there they are terrified when they spot Lucy at a crosswalk, paintings in hand, so they have to drive around the wrong way. Duke drives across lanes of highway, tears across the desert and drives right through the airport fence. He pulls the car right next to the plane and watches Gonzo get on it. There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die. Gonzo gives the Nixon salute and boards the plane.Back in the room, Duke contemplates Leary and the fall of the acid culture, calling them A generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel. He drives back to Los Angeles with the US flag trailing behind him. There was only one road back to L.A. - U.S. Interstate 15. Just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo. Then onto the Hollywood Freeway, and straight on into frantic oblivion. Safety. Obscurity. Just another freak, in the freak kingdom. He passes a sign that reads: You Are Now Leaving Fear and Loathing: Pop 0.

synopsis: Initially, as the opening credits roll, you see what appears to be a military force armed with guns and flame throwers and dressed in Bio Hazard suites entering a building as a recording from what sounds like an emergency call to 911 plays. A female operator takes the call and speaks in Spanish and a Male voice can be herd on the other end answering in English. The male voice on the recording only says They are sick, they are all sick. There is Blood there is blood everywhere..... there looking for me. The armed force finds multiple dead bodies and they look to be in a state of advance decay and are deformed. One man is found alive and is then taken by force back to a medical research facility on an Island off the coast of The Dominican Republic.You then see Dr.Edwards and Camila walking through a corridor towards a medical lab; Camila is an assistant to Dr.Edwards. As they walk together Camila mentions that Incidents in the States were isolated, successfully contained. We don't know how it reached the D.R. The mention of the incidents in the states would indicate that this takes place some time after the events of the first two Cabin Fever films.It is then relieved that the man found alive at the building is named Porter and was part of an effort providing aid and building houses for the poor and that he is actually Patient Zero. He, however, seems to be immune to the virus although he is a carrier. Porter and Dr. Edwards talk and Porter finds out that his son was one of the casualties. Dr. Edwards then tells him that he is immune to the virus and could be a great asset to his research to find a vaccine or cure to the virus. He does not voluntarily comply with the request but is told that he has no choice.Enter Marcus Driving through the Dominican Country Side. He meets up with and picks up his best friend Dobbs in a small village and drive on as they are Running Late and Josh's whole Family will be there. Cut to the Rehearsal Dinner for Marcus and Katia's wedding. You first see Josh (Marcus's brother) and Penny having sex in a cabana and getting walked in on by a security guard. Then it cuts to the dinner were Katia is giving a toast just as she finishes Marcus and Dobbs arrive and Josh and Penny came walking back to the dinner from having sex. They all head into the Village and while Penny is browsing a stand that sells local made Jewelry a black women starts speaking to her in Spanish and hands her a bracelet or necklace Penny says No Gracias as she does not understand the women but Dobbs comes up behind Penny and tells Penny that it is a gift and that it's a charm to ward off evil. You also see a shot of Josh buying Marijuana from a dealer off the street.Marcus, Josh, Dobbs, Penny, and Katia then walk down the marina together and stop to admire a yacht. Josh and Dobbs then announce that they have rented the yacht to take them out to what they are told is a deserted island for the evening as a bachelor present so they can have one last her-ah before he gets married the next day. Marcus looks to Katia for approval and gets it but katia does warn Marcus not to sail to far north because of restricted waters. Marcus, Josh, Dobbs and Penny board the vessel and set sail for the island.Back at the Medical facility Porter is obviously being held against his will and is even dressed as a convict with an orange jump suit on. He speaks with Camila through glass on a jail like phone system. He expresses his displeasure at the situation and demands to speak to the American Consulate and is told that he is being quarantined partially because of CDC regulation requiring he be held and that he is not just a carrier but possibly a cure. Porter also asks about his wife and whether she has been informed of his location to which Camila responds only that she is aware of what happened to their son. Porter demands to be allowed to speak with his wife and exclaims you can't just keep experimenting on me like this and threatens to kill himself if his demands are not met. Camila is obviously sympathetic toward Porter and his situation and speaks with Dr. Edwards who is very cold toward the situation and refers to Porter as The Specimen. This upsets Camila who responds Don't you mean human? Dr. Edwards then shows her a picture of one of the dead bodies found at the home were Porter was found, the body is hunched over and only it's back is visible but most of the flesh has rotted or has fallen away exposing it's skeleton. The ribs and spine of the body are visible surrounded by necrotic flesh. Dr. Edwards tells Camila not to personalize it and proclaims that sometimes you have to harm one to save millions.Back in his cell Porter is seen taking a metal spring off of his cot. He bends the rounded end until it is crescent shaped then he uses it to cut his hand and then he is shown squeezing blood from his hand. He is called to the door of his cell to prepare to have samples taken from him. Dr. Edwards and another man, both in Bio-Hazard suits, wait outside. The first man has a hypodermic needle and Dr. Edwards behind him holds a rifle. The door to the cell is unlocked remotely and as soon as the first man starts to enter Porter rams the door pinning the man with the needle half his body in the cell and half out. Porter takes the needle from the mans hand and slashes his suite open at the neck with it. He then reaches into the mans suite with his bloodied hand and smears his blood on the mans face infecting him with the virus. Dr. Edwards enters the cell, gun raised, Porter goes to his knees and yells you want my blood then holding up his cut hand says take it! If you want to shoot me? come on shoot! As this is going on flashing lights and a klaxon horn can be seen and herd sounding while personnel run about the lab. Then the words Warning Security Breach repeat over the loudspeaker. Camila argues that the situation is contained but a Male voice speaks over the PA system saying he is sorry but he has to impose a 48 hour security lock down protocol. Men dressed in camouflage are seen closing massive metal doors sealing Camila, Porter, the man who Porter infected and Bridgett (another of Dr.Edwards assistance who wears a lab coat showing a lot of cleavage) in the lab together for 2 days. .The other staff at the facility retreat to the evacuation bunker and wait for re-entry ClarenceBack on the yacht Penny is seen Sunbathing on the front deck as the Men on the ship all admire her. Then they all head to the rear of the boat and Shotgun Beers. Marcus sips his beer out of the hole he made in the bottom while the others actually Shotgun their beers. Josh heckles Marcus saying that Marcus is the one who taught them how to do this to which he replies yea when I was nineteen now I drink for flavor. Josh (now clutching a blow-up doll at the waist) gives a seemingly heart felt speech about his brothers impending marriage and then presents him with a gift. He thinks that at first it is a bottle of his favorite wine but after fully unwrapping it reveals a massive black colored dildo. Penny presents him with a small memento from their home town to remind him of were he came from. Josh pulls out the bag of Marijuana that he bought earlier in the town to Marcus's disapproval as he is concerned that the Coast Guard may stop them and find the drugs and threatens to throw it overboard. Dobbs interjects and reasons with Marcus pointing out that they have been going north for awhile now and have not seen another boat in at least two hours and asks Marcus to relax a little bit and let loose. Marcus agrees but after Dobbs makes a remark implying Marcus is scared of Katia is offended and retreats into the sleeping quarters of the boat. Penny follows and explains to Marcus that the guys are afraid to loose him. Penny removes her bikini top exposing her breasts and makes an advance but is rebuffed by Marcus they continue their conversation and it is reveled that Marcus was in love and had relations with Penney in the past but that she was now seeing his brother.They Arrive at the Island, which is not even on the map, and are initially skeptical when they see a large building on it but are assured by the captain of the Yacht that nobody is there and they will be alone on the island as promised. They all disembark the yacht and take a Skiff to shore and the Captain of the Yacht says he will be back to get them the next day. After coming ashore on the Island Josh and Penny immediately head out to go snorkeling while Marcus and Dobbs set up their camp and prepare the food. While snorkeling Josh and Penny are not able to find any fish in the water. Back on shore Marcus and Dobbs drink beer and then decide to smoke some Marijuana and get high. Still trying to find fish Josh and Penny keep swimming and suddenly come across a large amount of dead fish that look like they have been decaying in the water for a long time many with their bodies half missing exposing their innards and skeleton. Penny becomes scared and with Josh she returns to the campsite. She tells Marcus and Dobbs that it is a graveyard out their and she Josh interjects saying she thinks she saw body parts but he dismisses it as seeing leftover fish parts from a shark attack. Penny still distraught goes into their tent Josh joins in smoking Marijuana and drinking. Penny is seen drying herself off and as she does she notices a blistered rash starting to form on her arm and her noise begins to bleed.Back at the lab Dr. Edwards is continuing his work despite the incident and current lock down status. He has a Viruscide he wants to try and he now has a living infected person in the lab, the one that Porter Infected. He has the man confined in a small cell and plans to enter and inject him with the viruscide prototype but needs his assistant Bridgett to also help him. She informs him that all but one Bio-Hazard suite was taken to the bunker. Dr. Edwards decides that whoever gives the injection gets the suite and that is him. He sends Camila to try and talk Porter into cooperating with them. Dr. Edwards and Bridgett enter the cell and restrain the man on a table. Dr. Edwards places a tourniquet around his arm and as he tightens it breaks through his skin and embeds deep in the muscle causing a spray of a grayish liquid to erupt from his arm The man, now horribly disfigured and sick, screams in agony. He again screams as the doctor administers the injection.He begins to seize and flail about. Dr. Edwards yells for Bridgett to help him to hold the man down but she is reluctant as she has no protection from becoming infected except a surgical mask and lab coat. When she does move close to the patient to help restrain him he immediately projectile vomits a blackish red liquid all over her certainly infecting her. She runs from the room and strips off her Lab Coat and her outer clothing and gets into a shower but Bridgett knows she has been infected.At the campsite Marcus, Dobbs and Josh are now eating steak and lobster that they grilled and smoking Marijuana. Josh yells to Penny, still in the tent after her snorkeling incident and discovery of her rash and bloody nose, asking if she wants some steak which she does not. She summons him to the tent and he thinks it is for sex. He sees her symptoms which have gotten worse. Penny has blistering splotched over her entire body and a red rash. She then notices that Josh has a small rash on his leg similar to the one on her arm after they got back from snorkeling. He asked her if she had any bud she said yes before they went in the ocean and Josh chalks up the rashes to a bad reaction to the Marijuana strain. He goes to retrieve a First Aid Kit to treat her sores. He returns with Benadryl and Calamine lotion. Penny takes the pill and then Josh begins to rub the lotion on he body and they both quickly become aroused. He tells her to just lay back and they kiss briefly before he removes her bikini bottoms then starts kissing her foot and continues up her leg. When he gets to her thigh she pushes his head between her legs and he preforms Cunnilingus with her.Marcus and Dobbs walk out into the jungle a short ways from their camp and drink beers and smoke cigarettes while chatting. Marcus reveals to Dobbs the Penny is the girl the was only know as Cucumber Girl by his friends before as she apparently masturbated with a cucumber for Marcus. Dobbs is a taken back by this and asks if Josh knows to which Marcus says No and he dosent need to know. During this conversation they hear Penny scream and comment on how frequently they have sex.Josh is still pleasuring Penny but it seems to stop being pleasurable and she seems to start to feel pain. She screams and then tells him to stop. He makes a comment that she is so wet and lifts his head up. His face is covered in blood and some solid material of an unknown nature. She then sits up and projectile vomits the same substance that the man at the facility vomited on Bridgett, on Josh.Marcus and Dobbs return and find Josh looking distraught and he says I think Penny is sick as night falls they try to raise someone on the radio to no avail. They consider taking the skiff but realize they would only make it a few miles out to sea and the radio would still be useless. Marcus and Dobbs go to search for help at the building they saw earlier Josh and Penny stay at camp. After Marcus and Dobbs leave Penny tries to convince Josh to take the boat and just leave but Josh refuses to leave his brother but Josh is getting sicker by the minute.Marcus and Dobbs make it to the facility and find everything locked down but are able to gain entry through a Window after Marcus is able to lift one of the security shutters up. They find a room filled with radio equipment and other electronics most of which seems to have been destroyed purposely. There is blood and a fire ax embedded in a piece of electronics. They try to get Josh on the Walkie Talkies they have but are out of range. Dobbs touches a panel on the wall and the shutter falls back over the window trapping them in the room. Having no choice they head deeper into the facility. meanwhile at camp Josh keeps trying the radio calling for help. Somebody comes through on the radio asking for their location and what type of medical emergency they have. He identifies himself as Dr. Edwards a Surgeon at a small medical facility on the same island as them. His transmission begins to break up but he says he will help them and have an EMT waiting for them if they can make it to him. Penny's skin is rotting away and she is in agony. Penny being to sick to move on her own Josh leaves her and heads out alone to find the doctor on the radio.Now deep inside the facility Marcus and Dobbs come into a room that looks like a common dining area and kitchen but has been ransacked. They hear a noise coming from a door on the far side of the room. Marcus, ax in hand, moves to and opens the door. At first nothing appears to be there Marcus looks back at Dobbs for a moment and when he turns around a grotesque rotting man with a gun comes out and begins shooting at them. They run through a door and shut it behind them but the sick man gives chase. They run through the facility trying to find a way out and come upon a room filled with rotten, infected corpses. Dobbs falls into the room but Marcus manages to evade contact with the infected. Suddenly one of the infected reanimates and starts after Dobbs and he is between him and Marcus. Dobbs runs to the opposite side of the room and after some hesitation latches the door from the outside so the infected cant get to him..Josh is coming upon the Facility as this is happening.Marcus, now separated from Dobbs, has to fight off the zombie like infected and kills it with a blow to the head with the Fire Ax. Dobbs has lost his flashlight and lights his Zippo to use as a torch. He creeps through a dark passageway until he sees a light up ahead he begins to run but is knocked on his ass when he runs stright in to the large infected man they found in the kitchen. Marcus continues on without Dobbs and comes into a room that seems to be a medical lab with pictures of the infected on X-Ray lamps but it too is ransacked and the words Pumps Activated spray painted on the wall. Marcus Surveys the room and comes across a gurney with what appears to be a dead body covered in gauze.Dobbs is pleading with the large man who is identified as the head of the Facility and the one who initiated the 48 hour lock down. He is a military officer and thus the Facility seems to be under military control. He is in the advanced stages of the infection but has his mental faculties and tells Dobbs that he cannot allow this infection to get off the island. He fires his gun, a large Hand Cannon revolver, and since his body is so decayed the recoil from the gunshot snaps his arm off between the wrist and elbow and projects it,gun still grasped in the hand, upward and the barrel of the gun imbeds in the infected mans brain killing him.Dobbs takes his gun and escapes through a door and runs right into Josh. Dobbs gets paranoid and tells Josh to stay away from him as he sees he is also infected. He raises the gun and just then Marcus shows up. They get into a squabble about whos fault things are and Marcus ends up sucker punching Dobbs and taking the gun. Dobbs pushes a button and accidentally opens the door to the lab were Porter is. Bridgett greets them at the entrance with a surgical mask on and says Dr. Edwards wants them to come with her immediately. Camila shows up and reveals that Bridgett is infected and her face is rotting off she forces her to take the mask off so they can see her skin.Camila takes them to Dr. Edwards who is unaware of what happened after the Lock Down was initiated and is told that nobody is alive outside of that lab. Porter speaks up and accuses Dr. Edwards of luring them there and points out that his Bio-Hazard suite is equipped with a high powered radio and he could have used it to talk to Josh on the beach. Porter claims that it is Dr. Edwards intention to kill everyone left alive on the island and steal their boat So the award winning scholar gets off the island all by himself and no one knows that he is the one responsible. Dr. Edwards denies the allegations but Marcus has Josh take the Dr's rifle. Camila then asks if Josh got sick from the Facility and when he says all he did was go swimming she hypothesizes that Dr. Edwards may have deliberately dumped polluted water into the ocean to start a Pandemic so he could, with Porter's natural immunity to the virus, come up with a cure or vaccine and be a world wide hero. Camila then suggests that they all leave and destroy the facility which has a built in fail safe, a self destruct system.They leave in three groups. Dobbs, Dr. Edwards & Camila, Porter, Marcus & Josh,Bridgett. Josh and Bridgett head straight back to the Camp to check on Penny and prep the boat. On the way back to the camp Bridgett asks Josh were their boat is. He tells her and she promptly clubs him in the head with a large stick which whacks half his face off. She turns and runs off to try and steal the boat for herself. Back at the Facility Marcus's group head to the bunker room full of dead infected and Camila explains that the value in there needs to be turned before they start the Self Destruct System. Knowing that the chance is high of getting infected if any of them go in there Porter being immune to the infection volunteers and turns the valve. Dobbs and Dr. Edwards are behind Bridgett heading toward the camp and on the way the Dr. asks Dobbs if anyone has noticed his sores as he had gotten infected when he fell into the infected room earlier. Edwards asks Dobbs if he knows the progression of the virus and gruesomely explains what is going to happen to him. He then claims that he can treat him and possibly cure him but he needs to examine him to see how far the infection has progressed. He convinces Dobbs to lower the gun. Edwards looks at his sores says it dosent look that bad, sucker punches Dobbs, takes the gun, and before shooting him says It looks like your condition is fatal. Marcus's group reach a control panel and input the code to arm the Self Destruct System.Camila then says they need to clear the blast radius before it goes off so they gotta hustle.Bridgett reaches the camp and Penny is still alive all be it in terrible shape. Penny ask Bridgett who she is and she, keeping her back to Penny and wearing the surgical mask to hide her face, claims to be a doctor sent to evacuate her to safety and that she has already taken care of Josh. She turns around to look at Penny and when she sees her state similar to if not worse than her own, skin rotted, bloody sores covering her head to toe Bridgett says to Penny you might need a referral. Penny attacks Bridgett Pulling a chunk of her hair off along with the attached scalp. Bridgette is livid and stands back up after being knocked down from the previous attack and pulls off the surgical mask to reveal her grotesque zombie like face. When Penny sees this she quips your one ugly bitch! Penny then has her stomach ripped open by Bridgett but manages to get up and a cat fight ensues. Bridgett pins Penney inside the tent but she puts to much pressure on her arms which snap in half and she falls to the floor. Penny grabs the giant black color dildo and smashes whats left of her face to pulp. Penny however is pretty much dead herself already.Marcus, Porter and Camila are running back toward the camp and Marcus trips over Dobbs body when he gets up he sees the shell casing from the rifle round. He then calls out to Josh.He finds Josh's body on the trail just ahead of Dobbs's. He then furiously starts to look for Dr. Edwards. Marcus discovers Penny and Bridgett in the tent and when he withdrawals from the tent he is sucker punched by Dr. Edwards. Edwards then asks Camila what the protocol is for an outbreak? She answers  to isolate the exposed quarantine the sick. Edwards then argues that Marcus, though he has not shown any symptoms, has been exposed thus he can never leave the island. He argues that he killed Dobbs to spare him from a horrible agonizing death. Camila pleads with Dr.Edwards but he fires the rifle but only grazes Marcus. Camila throws herself in front of Marcus and Porter comes from behind Edwards. Edwards still has the gun raised at Camila and Marcus. Camila pleads with Porter to do something. Porter raises the Hand Cannon and shoots Dr. Edwards in the neck killing him. The Self destruct explosion then goes off and the facility is destroyed.Camila radios the yacht that dropped the group off, the Diablo. They are picked up and the captain asks about Marcus's friends but when he gets no answer leaves it at that only saying Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye.Marcus and Camila sit in the interior of the yacht and Porter comes in with two bottles of water and offers them to the others I thought you guys could use a drink. Porter goes to get some fresh air and Camila and Marcus pop the caps and each take a slug of their water. At that moment Marcus says all this because of a little mouse. Camila gets a strange look on her face and says what? Marcus explains that when he was in the Facility separated from Dobbs he came across a lab with a bunch of pictures and it seemed that the other Scientists, before they all died, were able to trace the source or the outbreak in the evacuation bunker to a mouse. Camila then has an epiphany she says Porter then repeats the word water several times. She remembers Porter singing the nursery rime song Three Blind Mice while in his cell. Three gunshots in rapid succession are herd above Camila and Marcus they then look at their water bottles and see blood in them. In the ships galley a plate with a hypodermic needle filled with blood next to bottles of water. They climb up to the helm to find the captain dead and the GPS and Radio shot. Porter had infected Marcus and Camila with the water. Killed the Captain and destroyed the instruments on the yacht and fled on the skiff. Marcus asks Camila why would he infect us? she says because we are the only ones left who know who he is. Camila is already showing sever signs of the virus and presumably they both died of the infection on the yacht.As the ending credits roll it is reveled by a backward playing of events left unseen before that Porter after he cut his hand with the spring, before he infected the guard, squeezed blood from his hand all over a small lab mouse after the incident when the lock down is implemented and they are being sealed in their lab Porter releases the mouse and it is able to make its way into the living quarters of the Evacuation bunker were the non quarantined staff were being keep until the 48 hour lock down was over. The mouse gets into the kitchen and is killed by someone in there on the table but everyone had already been infected. They were able to trace the spread of the virus back to the mouse on the table but there was nothing they could do. It is also reveled that Porter is the one who called Josh on the radio pretending to be Dr. Edwards to lure him to the lab. He had been plotting the end game the whole time.

title: Vampyr
synopsis: NOTE: Quotes indicate text titles from silent movie.This story is about the strange adventures of young Allan Gray [Julian West]. His studies of devil worship and vampire terror of earlier centuries have made him a dreamer, for whom the boundary between the real and the unreal has become him...One afternoon, during one of his aimless journeys, he arrived at a lonely inn close to the village of Courtempierre... where he takes a room. That evening, he hears a strange chanting, goes exploring and sees a man with a horribly misshapen face. In the moonstruck night light and shadow, voices and faces, seemed to take on hidden meaning. Allan Gray felt the darkness take control. In vain he tried to protect himself from unspeakable terror. Fear of the intangible followed him into a restless sleep. Allan is awakened by a noise at his chamber door. A man enters, says only She must not die...do you hear?' and gives Allan a package on which is written To be opened after my death.What was going on? Which horrifying secret was revealing itself? One thing became clear to Allan Gray. A human soul in fear of Death cried for help--and an inner voice ordered him to follow its call. Again, Allan goes snooping. He finds shadows--the shadow of a man UNdigging a hole, the shadow of a man with a wooden leg, shadow dancers. He hears barking dogs and a child wailing. The village Doctor [Jan Heironimko] appears and asks Allan: Did you hear it? There are no children or dogs here. Allan leaves, and the man is joined by an old woman who gives him a bottle of poison.(Allan) followed the shadows and entered a park. Among the ancient trees a chateau raised its towers into the haze of summer night. The man, whom Allan Gray had seen that same night at the inn, lived here in seclusion--with only his two daughters and a few servants. The daughters (Gisèlle [Rena Handel] and Léone [Sybille Schmitz]) appear to be ill. The family awaits the arrival of the village Doctor. Gisèlle lies in her bed and cries out, The blood! The blood!. The old man, lord of the manor [Maurice Schutz], is killed by the gun-carrying shadow. Allan is asked to stay with the family while a servant goes for the police.While he waits, Allan opens the mysterious package to find a book entitled The History of Vampires by Paul Bonnard. He reads ...about horrendous demons called vampires. At full moon the Dead, not at peace because of terrible deeds they did while living, rise from their coffins--to suck the blood of children and young people--and prolong their own life in the land of the shadows. The Prince of Darkness is their companion, and...at night, creatures of the Abyss visit homes of the living to sow Death and Despair. Whoever falls into the hands of a vampire withers away hopelessly...a wound on the throat, as by a bite of a rat or a cat, is the mark of Damnation. Neither Doctors nor...As Allan reads, Léone looks out the window to see Giselle wandering across the yard. Allan and Leone find her lifeless body and see an old woman walking away. While servants tend to the girl, Allan continues to read about vampires ...to grow accustomed to their miserable fate--which, besides pain in the body, brings untold agony to the Soul. Therefore, like an epidemic, a vampire's craving for blood is carried over to the victim, who himself becomes a vampire and goes searching for more victims among his dear ones. Whole families, yes, whole villages, in this way have been sucked into the curse...Shadows of executed criminals are their helpers. Living people may also be forced to do their dreadful bidding. A tale from Hungary tells how a village Doctor, having sold his soul to The Evil One became the helper of a vampire--and was accomplice to a series of horrid crimes in that parish. Here, vampires...The Doctor arrives and determines that Gisèlle needs blood. While Allan donates blood for a transfusion, the manservant reads from the book. The vampire, who had obtained complete power over its victim, tries in every possible way to drive it to suicide; for the one who takes his own life is lost for all eternity. For him, the golden gates of Heaven are closed--all hope is gone! Oh, you Devilish...the riddle of life? Who can penetrate the secrets hidden from the light of Day? Just as strange as the life of the vampires is the manner of breaking their might. These monsters, who cannot find peace, must be murdered so that persecuted Mankind may be freed from its nightmare. Many monasteries and libraries have, in their secret...how sometimes vampires have been made harmless. In the village of Kisiloba, which was haunted by a vampire in the body of an old woman, they went about it as follows. At dawn the grave was opened; they found the old one lying down, as if asleep. They drove a metal bar into her heart--and nailed her detestable soul to the crypt. She now died a true Death, and the crime, that rested over...Certain places were beset by vampires. Many years ago there was a foul epidemic in the village of Courtempierre--claiming eleven victims. Doctors gave the sickness a scientific name. Yet among men a rumour spread that a vampire was playing its game. People believed this vampire was one Marguerite Chopin [Henriette Gerard], buried in the village churchyard. All her life, Marguerite Chopin was a monster in a human body. She died without remorse, and at the hour of Death the Church refused her...As Allan rests from his blood donation, a voice in the background is heard saying Come with me. We will be one soul...one body...death is waiting. The manservant awakens Allan just in time for them to stop Gisèlle from taking the poison left at her bedside by the Doctor. Gisèlle must not die till sunrise. The Doctor escapes, but Allan follows. Allan's shadow separates from his body. He goes to the Doctor's house where he finds his own body in a coffin, and the body of Léone tied to a bed. As Allan's shadow watches, the Doctor and his wooden-legged helper nail shut the coffin. Is this actually happening, is it a memory or perhaps a dream induced by Allan's lack of blood?Now Allan watches the manservant digging up a grave, and he goes over to help. Is it his own grave? Will he find his own body? They open the grave to find the old woman's body. As the morning sun rises, the manservant drives a stake through Marquerite Chopin's body. Gisèlle sits up in bed. I feel strong, she says. My soul is free. The man with the wooden leg falls down the stairs and is killed. The Doctor becomes entrapped and buried in a grain elevator. Allan unties Léone and they go home together. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]

title: I, Frankenstein
synopsis: The aurora was seen in the starry sky high above snow covered mountains.Trekking through the steep snow was Adam (Aaron Eckhart). In his arms was the limp body of his creator, Victor Frankenstein (Aden Young). Adam made his way to the top of the mountain.I was cast into being in the winter of 1795. Adam narrated as he continued to walk. A living corpse without a soul. He walked across a freezing river. As he said the next lines, a flashback occurred showing how he was made. Stitched. Jolted. Bludgeoned back to life... by a mad man. Victor, with his creation wrapped up like a mummy, rolled the body off a bridge and into the river below. Horrified by his creation, he tried to destroy me. But I survived. In the flashback, Adam surfaced from the muddy river, and made his way back to the castle. And found my way... back to him.Victor looked around in horror as he heard his wife, Elizabeth (Virginie Le Brun), scream.A life for a life. That's what I wanted. Adam narrated. Victor ran back to his bedroom where the scream came from, only to find Elizabeth dead on the bed. I took that... of his beloved new bride. Victor saw Adam sneak back out of a door.On a search for vengeance, Victor traveled through a blizzard, as Adam continued his narration. He pursued me through the far north. I was immune to the cold... he was not. Victor fell to the ground. Dead. Adam appeared over his body.Adam arrived at what appeared to be an old run downed church. Gargoyle statues were perched at places around it. Arriving at a cemetery, Adam dropped to his knees, and Victor rolled to the ground. Next he dug a grave, and gently laid his body in it.I Buried him, Adam continued his narration. In his family cemetery. It was more than he deserved. As Adam stood over the grave, his face was revealed. Long messy hair, and full of scars. I thought it was the end... but was actually... just the beginning. On the cross that served as Victor's grave stone, read 'Frankenstein'. With an angry frown, he started to shovel dirt into the grave.Before he could finish burying his creator, sharp finger nails scratched at a nearby gravestone. Adam quickly turned around, only to be surrounded by humanoid creatures in priest robes.We have been waiting for you, one of the creatures said before his skin burned off, and a demonic face looked back at Adam. You will come with us. Adam tried to fight the closest one, only for it to send him flying into a mausoleum.He tried to get up and fight them, but one of them managed to pin him down by his throat. Adam saw a nearby grave marker that was in a strange symbol. With some struggle, he managed to grab it and quickly stabbed the creature that pinned him down. Said creature burst into flames.Further away, a stone Gargoyle faced in the direction of the grave. Barely a second later, a purple eye opened on it.Back with Adam, the flames from the dead creature swirled around him before it vanished.Several more Gargoyles started to move as the fight escalated in the cemetery. One creature managed to pin Adam down with a weapon, and kept kicking his face until Adam went unconscious. But before he could go for the killing blow, the lead creature told him they needed him alive. After he said that, a Gargoyle grabbed several of the creatures and lifted them in the air. Being left alone, he tried to run, only for one of them to spear him through the chest, which caused his to burst into flames.Ophir (Mahesh Jadu), the one that stabbed the leader, transformed into his human form, and looked up at the sky. The other Gargoyle killed the remaining creature, and the flames went into the ground.That was the last of them. Keziah (Caitlin Stasey) said as she joined Ophir in the cemetery. They both wonder just what Adam is. Ophir remarks, I never seen a human kill a demon before. And with such strength.It's been a long time since I've seen demons this far north. Ophir said as Keziah examined the unconscious Adam. They both figure that Adam is something special. Ophir dropped down in Victor's grave, and searched. He pulled out a book. Victor's journal.As Keziah placed her hands on Adam's chest, he stirred in his sleep. He's alive. It's alive!Adam quickly woke with a start. Only to find that his hands were shackled to the floor in a strange room. Ophir tried to calm him with a 'shush'.Your Majesty! Keziah called as Gideon (Jai Courtney) entered the room. Behind Gideon was Leonore (Miranda Otto). Adam looked fearful and helpless as the four examined him.No more than a wild beast, your Majesty. Gideon said. Destroy it. Be done with this. Seeing the shackles starting to rip from the floor, Keziah brought her daggers to Adam's throat. Adam looked to his other side, and saw that Ophir had done the same.So, you understand reason. Leonore spoke.Where am I? Adam finally spoke. How did I get here? Instead of answering, Leonore only wanted to know about the creatures that attacked Adam, and what did they want. I don't know!We heard them speak of Naberius. Ophir told him. Keziah also mentioned that Naberius wanted Adam alive, only she used 'thing' instead of Adam.If Naberius wants it alive... all the more reason to destroy it. Gideon stalked forward, only for Adam to struggled in his shackles with a 'no!'. But before Gideon could strike, Leonore stopped him. As Leonore approached Adam, he raised up in a defiant way. His shackles holding steady. Leonore brushed some of Adam's long hair from his fearful face.Him, Leonore corrected. Not it.As the group lead Adam down a corridor, she introduced herself as Leonore. High Queen of the Gargoyle order. Next was Gideon, her most trusted warrior. She then tells him that he was attacked by four demons under the command of a dark prince called Naberius. She then leads him to a window, and outside, was a huge castle. Gargoyles were frozen in place all over it.The Gargoyle order was commanded into being by the great archangel Michael. Leonore explained. 'tis our sacred duty to wage war against the demon horde. The six hundred and sixty six legions of Hell spawned creatures unleashed by Satan after his fall from Heaven. Humans think of us as mere decoration. They do not know nor could they can see that the brutal unseen war being fought around them every day. The war that may one day determine the fate of all mankind. You have now been drawn into this war.I care not for the world of man. Adam responded, only for Leonore to say that she knows about him. Shunned by his creator. Lost and alone.You will be welcomed here. Until we learn why Naberius wants you. I ask that you stay with us. Safe within these hallowed walls. Leonore said, only for Adam to say he goes his own way. Gideon also bright up the fact that Adam murdered Elizabeth. Victor Frankenstein's wife. All in the heat of passion. Driven by emotions he was never taught to control. He may be more human than he realizes.After she said that, Adam only walks away. But quickly turned around when Leonore says, I understand Frankenstein never offered you a name. I should like to call you... Adam. I promise you this, Adam. Each of us has a higher purpose. Yours has simple yet to reveal itself.After that, Ophir and Keziah lead Adam through the castle. They tell him that they are always outnumbered and their ranks have thinned, but demons remain strong. And to help Adam survive against them, the Queen has asked them to provide him with weapons.Once they enter the weapon room, Ophir tells him that demons can only be descended by blessed objects, such as holy water or a crucifix. Adam picks up a weapon. Keziah mentions that any objects can be made sacramental by marking them with the blessed symbol of the Gargoyle order. And upon looking closer at the weapon, Adam saw it was marked with the symbol.Descended? Adam asked as he continued to look around for a weapon.When a demon is killed, its spirit descends to hell. Where it remains trapped for all eternity. Ophir answered. Only for Adam to ask, 'How do you descend a Gargoyle?' Keziah tells him that they are sacramental beings of light and good. They ascend. And only godless creatures that have no souls can ascend a Gargoyle.As Adam picks up a pair of blunt weapons, Ophir tells him he would not want that because it's blunt and crude and far too heavy to wield. In response, Adam picks up the other one, and swings both around with ease. Ophir asks him to take a side in the war, and use his gift. Adam walks out of the room with one glance back.I do not care how many demons it descended. Gideon told Leonore. You should've let me destroy it. She tells him she's not blind to the risk, and that Adam is alive. And all life is sacred. It is not human born. In which Leonore replies, 'Neither are we, Gideon.' She handed Gideon Victor's journal and tells him to lock it in the vault. It must never fall into Naberius' hands. Gideon tells her it's only a book.'tis written proof that God is no longer the sole creator of man. Leonore told him.Adam exited the castle. Before he left, Ophir told him that if he should ever change his mind, he will always find refuge at the castle.Trusting others, Adam narrated. Is a mistake you only make once. And so I resolve to seek out the farthest corners of the Earth. As he narrated, Adam once again trekked throughout the world. Where no human, demon or Gargoyle would ever find me. So many years passed, I lost track of time. Yet I did not grow old and die as humans do. Adam stood high on a mountain practicing how to use his weapons. Victor Frankenstein's final curse. Adam sketched the Gargoyle symbol onto a homemade dagger. I thought Naberius' demons have forgotten me... but I was wrong. Three demons crept through a forest. And I unleashed all my range upon them. His voice turned into a growl towards the end.Adam set a trap for the three demons. And before they knew it, they were nothing more than flames shooting into the sky, before finally being descended back to hell.I had hidden long enough, Adam narrated as time passed. His hair was now shorter, and his scars were more visible. Now I would hunt those... who are hunting me. I returned to the place I had left so long ago. As he looked over the city, he saw that it had changed drastically. Lights shone brightly. And the castle was now in the middle of a city. The human world has changed, He walked through a crowd. In the time I had been gone. But some things... had not changed.Adam entered a club. Everyone looked at him. If the demons found me in the wilderness. It was only a matter of time before they found me here. He watched a man at a nearby table. Which is why I had to find them first.He followed the man as he left the club. As he entered a dark alley, he removed his twin weapons. One demon quickly jumped from the shadows. Adam managed to catch him, and pin him to a wall. He asked the demon where Naberius was. But instead, a cop had followed him into the alley. Adam used the demon as a human shield.The creature broke free of Adam's hold, broke his weapon in half, and managed to break the cop's neck in a matter of seconds.Two more demons landed in the alley, which were both taken down in rapid succession. After killing the two demons, he saw the first demon take off down the alley. He chased him, even as the demon climbed up a wall. Once Adam arrived on top of the building, the demon jumped off and ran.Before he could think about giving chase, a Gargoyle swooped down and picked Adam up.Naberius (Bill Nighy) sat in the observation room, which overlooked the lab. He observed the experiment that was happening below. Through the glass was Terra (Yvonne Strahovski). Naberius told her that time was fleeting and not to waste his.Down in the room was a dead rat that was hooked to a large machine. And as the experiment commenced, the machine lit up. First, the mouse started to spasm, then it's heart started to spike until it neared a cardiac arrest. They pushed the machine to it's limit, until it shut down. As Terra walked up to the machine, Carl Avery (Nicholas Bell) said there was a heartbeat.Naberius looked closer at the events through the window. His lips started to curve upwards at the events. Another man entered the room, Dekar (Kevin Grevioux), whispered in his ear. Sir, we have a situation.In another room, standing before Naberius was the demon that Adam fought. He told Neberius about the events, and also exaggerating some bits of the story. The way it attacked. Strong and fast... like a Gargoyle. It descended... seven of us. I managed to fight it off. I think I wounded it.It descended seven demons? Naberius asked. Yet, you escaped? As he questioned the man, including, 'You presumed? You presumed to know what I want.', Dekar slowly moved away from the demon. And you thought I want you to tell me about the creature rather than capture it yourself. That's the choice you made. It's interesting. Naberius walked passed the demon, only to turn around and slap him. Do not ever... presume to know what I want. Is that understood. The demon, from his position, asks for forgiveness, and calls him Prince Naberius.Outside, a demon watches as the Gargoyle carries away Adam. Once they reached the top of the castle, the Gargoyle tossed Adam through a window. The Gargoyle, which turns into Ophir, enters the window. As Adam mentions Ophir, several Gargoyles pop out of the shadows and shackle Adam by his arms and legs. All four Gargoyles pull, which lift Adam into the air where Gideon places a collar around Adam's neck.Back with Naberius, he poked at the rat and asked Terra when they will begin the final stage. As soon as she says that reanimating a human is far out of reach, Naberius asked her what she knew of a scientist by the name of Victor Frankenstein.Frankenstein is a myth. A horror story made up to scare children. Terra replied. And where did he go? Why did he disappear if he really animated a human corpse? Why not share his technology with the rest of the world to save lives and cure paralysis?Perhaps he wasn't magnanimous as you are, doctor. Naberius said. Terra replied that every scientist keeps a record. Even when their experiments end in failure. But if Frankenstein... was real, if he really did animate a human, would it help you to study it? Terra said yes, but the corpse must be over two hundred years old, and nothing left but bones.Adam was strapped in a chair. Leonore entered the room and told him that their war is a war that must be fought in the shadows. It wasn't an open battlefield.You care only about yourself, Adam. Leonore told him. Gideon mentions the human that was killed in the alley, in which Adam said, 'I didn't kill him.' Gideon tells him that his actions lead to his death.They decide that it's best to keep Adam locked up in the castle. They can't risk unleashing him on the streets.My life is my own. You will not take it from me. Adam said.Your life was not granted to you by the grace of god! It was fabricated in a laboratory. And until you learn to use it wisely, I will do what I must.Then you are no better than Naberius! As he said that, her kind face was replaced with a demonic looking one.Seeing Adam's look, she reverted back. When I met you, my first thought was to have you destroyed. But then I looked into your eyes, and do you know what I saw there? Not a soul... but the potential for one. Now all I see is darkness.I knew of no other way. He said as they were about to walk out. But that stopped them. I am not human. Nor Gargoyle. Nor Demon. I am like none other. Ophir and Keziah close the doors on him.Meanwhile, Zuriel (Socratis Otto) stood before Naberius. Dekar asked Zuriel how he plans to remove the creature from the cathedral. He planned on sacrificing his own men to cut the Gargoyle numbers.Zuriel. None of my legions ever had so worthy a commander as you. Naberius praised from his desk. Would they have sacrificed themselves so bravely, so willingly for anyone less. You know what this could mean for them. Do not forget. Now, bring me Frankenstein's monster.The demon horde ran through the streets on their way to the cathedral. The Gargoyles watched them from their perch.Gideon asked how many when told of the demons. Keziah replies that there were fifty or so. And once Gideon looked out the window, hordes of demons were running through the streets. As they got close to the cathedral, the Gargoyles went on the attack.But on a nearby rooftop, Zuriel watched. He transformed into his demonic form, and ran towards the cathedral. Zuriel and his soldiers leapt from the high buildings. On each building, were at least hundreds of demons. Each leaping from the building.Gideon told Ophir and Keziah to secure the creature. Throughout the cathedral, blue lights shone all the way up to the heavens as Gargoyle and Gargoyle was ascended. Gideon formed a battle axe with his three weapons. With demons entering the cathedral, he prepared for battle.Demon after demon entered, only to be felled by Gideon and two other Gargoyles. But not wanting to be overrun, he kicked several demons out the open window, and jumped after them. He transformed halfway down.Back in the room, the demons picked up Adam's trail. Ophir and Keziah stood on either side of a still chained Adam. He begged them for a weapon. Ophir growled, and swung his weapon. Which shattered Adam's binds. Now free, Ophir handed Adam a bladed weapon, just as the demons started to break through the door.Seeing the door about to give way, Adam quickly broke it down and used it as a shield as he charged through the horde. Ophir and Keziah were right behind him, killing what Adam missed.As Keziah killed another demon, she was struck from behind. Ophir was also struck, and she watched as he ascended before her eyes.The clock struck twelve, and the loud bell rang. Gideon stood atop the cathedral, and seeing the carnage below him, he roared. Filled with rage, he swooped down and sliced any demon that he saw.The demons had started to flee back towards the city. The remaining Gargoyles, in their rage, gave chase.Inside, Adam approached the wounded Keziah. He offered to do what he can to help, but she said she wanted to be with Ophir. Their love was forbidden by the order, Will not be so anymore. With that, she a few tears dripped from her eyes as she ascended.Leonore told her guards to help the others.Adam began to get information from a demon that was left behind. We knew the Gargoyles would do everything they could to keep you out of Naberius' hands. A demon exploded through the window and struck Leonore. In the heat of battle, they left unprotected... their greatest treasure. The demon grabbed Leonore by the throat. All we had to do was lure Gideon and the others away.With Gideon, two of his fellow Gargoyles captured a female demon that came with a message from Zuriel.Adam punched his captured demon. Tell me where Zuriel took her. Not getting an answer, he punched again.She locked you up. She despised you! The demon said. You are nothing to her, but another grand human mistake! Adam grabbed the demon and brought him over to a small fountain. Filled with holy water. Even being three inches away from the water, the demon had started to smoke. Adam asked again. Gideon is to bring you there. In exchange for Leonore. Adam shoved the demon's face into the water. His face started to burn away, and as Adam threw him to the ground, he exploded in flames.Descend in pain, demon.Adam exited the cathedral just as the Gargoyles returned. Gideon entered the room where Leonore was attacked, only to see a small crater.Gideon walked through the halls of the cathedral. He was flanked by two other Gargoyles, who tell him it is forbidden to remove the items in the vault and that none of them have the authority to do so. The queen had expressively forbidden it. And it was dangerous to do so.Leonore is the spiritual leader of the entire order. Our only direct link to the archangels. Without her, we're but a... dying flock of vigilantes with no hope of ever being reinforced. Is that what you want? Gideon told them.Once Gideon arrive at the vault, he placed his two daggers into a panel in the floor which acted as a keyhole. Once he turned it, an alter opened up, with spiraling stairs that lead down. He made his way down into the room. Instead of looking around, he made his way to a box, and upon opening it, he pulled out. Frankenstein's journal.May god forgive me. He said as he closed the box.Adam entered the building, at the same time Gideon did. Only the latter broke through the ceiling, only to see Zuriel holding Leonore, who says he should not have come. Zuriel ask him to show his weapons, which he replies he is unarmed, as Zuriel instructed. Zuriel then ask where is the creature.As Gideon spoke, Adam was sneaking around in the shadows. I no longer know. When I returned to the cathedral, it had already escaped. Zuriel grabbed Leonore by the throat. Wait! He pulled out Frankenstein's journal. Leonore shook her head as she saw what he brought. This is the private scientific journal of Victor Frankenstein. We found it on Frankenstein's body the night we rescued the creature two hundred years ago. It contains, in detail, how Victor Frankenstein conceived, and then constructed his unholy abomination. Several demons started to stealthily make their way in the room. And I pray that it may save my queen now.Gideon, I command you take the journal from this place and let me ascend. She told him.Instead of obeying her, he placed the journal at Zuriel's feet. And as soon as Zuriel dropped Leonore, Gideon grabbed her and flew through the hole in the ceiling.Adam quickly leapt from his spot, weapons raised, and landed before Zuriel, who took off with journal in hand. The demons were quick to attack Adam, but they fell quickly. With them dead, he quickly took off after Zuriel, who used a keycard to enter an elevator. Adam quickly slit the throat of the lone demon near the elevator and took his keycard.Zuriel handed the journal to Naberius, who asked what it was. Nearby, cutting a corpse open, was Molokai ([link=nm0817748[).It looks like Victor Frankenstein's hand written account of how he brought his creature to life. This is better for us. This is everything we need to bring back our fallen.We'll let the humans decide that. Naberius replied walking away.Adam watched everything from is position from a column. He quickly followed after the two demons, only to come to a stop at another elevator. But past the elevator, he saw something disturbing. Hundreds of dead bodies hooked to some machine.Naberius entered Terra's lab, and walked up to her. Journal in hand. You asked for Frankenstein's creature. I bring you something far more... edifying. He handed her the book, which she flipped open. She was curious to where he got it, but Carl was curious to know if it was real, to which Naberius replied, You tell me. When Naberius left the two alone, Terra continued to flip through the pages.Back at the cathedral, Leonore stared at the seat that Adam was chained to. Gideon told her they lost sixteen warriors.I should never have held him here. Leonore said still looking at the chair. Gideon said it was the creature's doing, not hers. Was I wrong to keep the journal from him?Everything you do is for the good of humanity. There is no wrong in that. However, now that the creature knows of the journal's existence...Why must you call him that? She asked.Now that he knows. What are you prepared to do?Find Adam. She told him with conviction. Call every Gargoyle you can spare. Post them on every rooftop. Gideon argued about what they will do after they find him. 'Bring him back to the cathedral, and sacrifice even more Gargoyles to protect him?' God may not have put Adam on this Earth, but he did allow him to live over two hundred years against incredible odds. It is not for you or I to deny God's purpose.Sooner or later, your Majesty, you will have no choice.Back at the lab, Terra continued to read the journal. Eels...? Carl asked 'what?'. Electric eels. That's where he got his power from. Six electric eels generating five hundred volts each. From there, they talked about all that energy flowing through the creature's veins, powering its heart and other organs. But then the conversation drifted to what would it take to kill it.Adam made his way through the building, until he made his way to the observation room. From there, he could see Terra. And then he saw her looking through the journal. And the page she was looking at was an exact picture of Adam. As Terra realizes something they may have missed, Adam burst through the glass and landed in the lab. Sirens blared as Terra met Adam's eyes. As he got closer to her, she shakily gave him the journal.Dekar and several more men took this time to enter. Adam looked each way for an exit as he backed away from the men.Leave him be! Naberius commanded. My apologies for the zealous nature of our security. Perhaps if you'd simply knocked on the front door, this unfortunate awkwardness might've been avoided.Who are you? Adam asked.Charles Wessex. And you... must be Frankenstein. Naberius walked closer to Adam.My name is Adam.We are all the sons of our fathers, are we not? Denying who we are only means that we are... lost. I am a journeyman. A partisan of progress. Like your father, I too seek to unravel the mortal coils of life. This is doctor Wade. She's one of the worlds most respected electro physiologist. Terra, wracked with nervousness managed a small, 'Hello.' I have been trying to replicate Victor Frankenstein's stunning triumph... for quite some time. He now stood by Dekar.Terra managed to overcome her nerves and spoke up. What I've read of the journal has already been extremely helpful... Adam gave her an angry look that made her shut up.Be reasonable, Adam. You are a living miracle. You contain answers so many seek. Naberius said.I seek my own answers. Adam replied.Of course you do. Naberius walked even closer to Adam. Stay with us. Help us understand your fathers work, and together we can unlock those answers and more. Far behind Naberius, Zuriel stood. Naberius looked into Adam's eyes. Yes... Victor Frankenstein gave you life. But he could not restore your soul, could he? As Naberius was about to touch Adam, he quickly grabbed his hand, only for Naberius' eyes to flash. Zuriel came running towards him. With no other escape route, Adam dove out the window behind him.Instead of hitting the ground, he went though it and landed on a moving subway train. He rolled on the top of it, until he fell through an opening. He managed to grab onto the train before he could fall between it. Seeing nowhere else to go, he entered the train car, and sat in a seat. He pulled out the journal and gently flipped through it.Back in the building, Dekar told Naberius that their was no sign of the creature. He could be anywhere by now. Zuriel said that it would find a safe place so it can study the journal... and then come back. As Naberius asked, 'For what?', Terra entered the area and came up to them. Zuriel then says, Answers.Terra asked Naberius to explain what is going on. But Naberius only says it was just a break in. A security matter. Terra then shakes that off, and tells him that Frankenstein's creature is alive. She then asked who Zuriel is. Only for Naberius to say he is just an extra layer of security.Well your extra layer of security just blew any hopes I might have had of analyzing that creature. Terra said. Didn't you hear what it said? It wants answers and I'm the one who might've been able to provide them. The only one.You may be right. Naberius said, but he was looking at Zuriel. He turned back to Terra. You look tired, doctor. It's late. You really ought to get some rest. Terra started to argue with that. We lost both the creature and the journal, doctor. What more can you do tonight? She continued to argue with him. I will notify you should we recover the one or the other. Go home doctor.Back in the train, Adam continued to read the journal.I am not recording the visions of a madman. My methods and reasons are scientifically sound. Adam's voice faded to Victor's as he flipped through the book. I succeeded in discovering the core in the generation of life. A graveyard to furnish the few raw materials I require... Adam came upon the picture of himself. He quickly slammed the book shut.Terra walked out of the building. But inside the building, Zuriel and Naberius watched her from a window high above. Naberius asked Zuriel how certain it will come for her.It needs someone to make sense of the journal. Only she can do that.Adam watched Terra from his position on a building. He kept tailing her, even when she got on a train. She noticed someone following her, so she ran and hid behind an object. She was unaware that Adam was behind her. And as she turned around, he put his hand over her mouth. He told her he won't hurt her and released her. And as he started to walk away, he told her to come with him, which she did.Why are you following me? She asked him.How close are you to reanimating a human corpse? He asked her instead of answering. She said that she couldn't tell him that. He handed her the journal. Would this help? She tried to grab it, only for him to yank it back. She said that she hadn't had the chance to finish the book. What if you examine me? She replied, 'Back at the institute?'. Not there. Somewhere away from it. She argued that all of her equipment is there. You know who it is your working for? She answered, 'Mr. Wessex?' That's not who you think he is. There's a war. A war humans don't know about. It's been going on for centuries. It could mean the end of all mankind.A war between who?Gargoyles and demons. I think your boss is a demon prince called Naberius. Adam explained, only for her to say, 'A demon prince?' Been hunting me. For over two hundred years. Now I think I know why. We have to get off the streets. As he kicked open a door, Zuriel, who was looking for them, heard the noise. Terra hesitated, but followed Adam into the building. Naberius is storing human corpses at the Wessex institute.Corpses? No, we're still years away for human trials. She told him, only for him to say he saw the bodies. He mentions that there's enough to animate an entire army of monsters like him.Zuriel entered the building behind them.What did you say your name is? Adam? Terra said.That's the name the Gargoyle Queen gave to me.Look... I understand you probably suffered severe brain damage during the reanimation process given the level of...This is real! Adam interrupted. All of it. Instead of believing him, she simply told him she didn't believe in Gargoyles.Frankenstein! Zuriel yelled as he appeared. As Adam got his weapons ready, Zuriel's skin burned away and revealed his demonic form.Oh, shit! Terra said as she saw it.Adam told her to run. Both Adam and Zuriel charged for each other. Adam and Zuriel both have the same type of weapons. This ends tonight. Adam said, then charged forward.During the intense fight, Adam was kicked off a scaffold. Zuriel dove down after him, then held his weapon to Adam's throat. Adam told him that he saw the bodies, and that they will never be able to control them. But Zuriel tells him that control has never been the problem, and that there are millions of demon spirits trapped and waiting for a chance to possess a human. Nearby, Terra made her way closer to them. And when Adam asked what everything had to do with him, Zuriel's reply was simple.You have no soul. And a demon spirit can only possess a body that has no soul. Zuriel picked up the journal from Adam's pocket. You know what the best thing about having the journal is. I no longer need to bring you in alive. Before he could strike a killing blow, Terra yells that she needs it alive.As Terra kept on talking, Zuriel didn't see the hidden knife that Adam pulled from his sleeve. Zuriel leaned down to Adam's level as he contemplated keeping him alive. But as he grabbed Adam, a knife slammed into his stomach. Both Adam and Terra watched as Zuriel started to burn away, but he was still holding the journal. Adam told Terra to grab it before it was destroyed. She managed to grab it just as Zuriel descendedTerra lead Adam back to his hideout. She went through the cabinet for something she could use, but as she closed the door, she saw Adam through the mirror. Not because he was shirtless, but because of the scars that littered it. She told him to sit down. At first, he refused. When he finally sat down, it was with a pained grunt. On his back was a bleeding stab wound, that she started to sew up. He flinched at the pain. As she continued to sew his wound, he told her they couldn't stay there long. He told her that they need to get to Leonore, but she still doesn't believe him. He tells her that Naberius will kill most of the humans, and enslave the rest. But when she says what will he do, Adam replies that it has nothing to do with him.Well, of course it does. You're as much a part of this world as anybody. He tells her that he's different. You're not that different.I'm a dozen used parts from eight different corpses. I'm a monster.You're only a monster if you behave like one. She told him. Once she was done sewing him, he tells her that he never had to thank a human for anything before. We have our uses, I suppose. Adam laid down on the bed and drifted off. Terra turned to him, only to see him asleep. She grabbed the journal from her bag and flipped it open.Back where Zuriel died, Naberius and his demons search for the journal.When Adam woke up, he saw Terra reading through the journal. When she asked how he was feeling, he replied with, I've been through worst.What happened to Victor Frankenstein? They say he vanished after his... Adam looked from the sink, and stared in the mirror. ...wife died.I killed his wife. Adam said as he put on his shirt. He hunted me. I would've killed him too. But he froze to death. I hated him.Have you... killed anyone since? Terra asked.Only demons.After a moment, Terra told him that she finished the book, and that Victor refined the process after Adam. As she handed the journal back to Adam, she told him she thinks she could reproduce it. And even improve on it.Frankenstein promised to make you a companion, didn't he? Terra asked.A promise he broke. Adam replied.Is that why you came to me? You want me to fulfill Victor Frankenstein's promise. Once she finished, her cell phone rang. It was Carl. She told him to leave Wessex.With Carl, as he was about to meet Terra, he ran into Dekar.Adam told her she shouldn't have done that. He offered to go with her to the train station, to protect her, but she turned him down. But before she walked out, he gave her his dagger that had the blessed symbol on it.Once Terra reached the station, she found out it was a trap. Dekar appeared behind her. She quickly swung the dagger, only for Dekar to grab her wrist, which he snapped causing her to drop the knife.Adam entered the cathedral. But Barachel and Levi restrained him as they lead him to Leonore, who told them to release him. Adam wanted to know why Leonore lied to him, only for her to say she had a higher duty to protect the human race.Do you understand what this journal is to me. It's the chronicle of how I came to be. Who I am. What I am.You are a unique lonely being rejected by both your maker and the rest of humanity. And as a result, you were filled with rage. You do not need a book to tell you that. He tells her that Naberius has found a way to summon every demon they ever descended. When she asked 'what', he simply said possession. Bodies that have no souls.Only the dead have no souls. What is the use of possessing a corpse? Gideon said.There is none. Unless you can animate that corpse. Adam answered. Naberius has been planning this for centuries. Victor Frankenstein just made it possible. When Leonore asked how he knew about all of that, he replied, I've seen the bodies. There are tens of thousands of them.He tells them he has someone he has to protect. A human. What will you have us do? Leonore asked.Get us out of here. Was his demand. Then I will tell you where to find him.Retrieve your scientist. Come back here, then we shall take you where you wish to go. Leonore said. I've made too many mistakes with you, Adam. I will not make another. With that said, Adam walked out. Follow him, Gideon. As soon as you have the journal in sight, destroy him.Adam walked through an alley. A loud noise put him on alert. Upon entering a building, he grabbed an axe from a fire case. He walked down a hallway. The floor creaked, the walls were rotted, paper and trash were scattered about. And every little noise caused him to go on alert. He slowly entered his hideout, while calling out for Terra. Instead of Terra, he found the journal on the floor near the bed.His eyes caught a glimpse of something in the mirror. But as he turned around, Gideon slammed into him and knocked him through the wall. Gideon slammed into him again, and this time, he flew through a door, and came to a roll to the hole that Gideon first made. He used his axe to keep himself from falling all the way to the ground.Gideon stood over Adam. His foot went under the axe. And with a smirk, his foot raised which caused the axe to fly back and Adam to fall. But luckily he grabbed onto the floor before he could fall. He managed to climb back up, but there wasn't a sign of Gideon. But behind him, Gideon flew back towards the building and slammed into Adam before he could react. Gideon, grabbing Adam by the neck, slammed through wall after wall, which caused the roof to collapse behind them. And finally, they were outside. Only Gideon had released Adam, which caused him to fall. While falling, Gideon swung his battle axe, only for Adam to grab it. Adam struck a car, followed by Gideon on top of him.But it turned out that Adam used Gideon's own weapon against him. Remember, I have no soul.God will surely damn you. A blue light surrounded Gideon.He already did. Adam responded as Gideon ascended.Seeing the blue light. Two Gargoyles hurried to the location. A while later, Levi handed Gideon's cloth to Leonore.Back on the street, Adam picked up the knife that he gave to Terra.Inside Wessex, Terra escaped Dekar's grip, and confronted Naberius. I know who you are. And I know what you want me to do. And I won't do it. I'd rather die.Naberius quickly grabbed Carl by his throat, and squeezed. Terra rushed to Carl as he crumpled to the floor. You want him back? Show me how.Carl was now hooked to a machine, with a tearful Terra doing the procedure. The machine fired up, but Carl wasn't the only thing the machine was reanimating. All the other human corpses that Naberius had, the machine also turned on.Meanwhile, Adam threw the journal into a fire. He watched as the picture of himself went up in flames. He begin to walk towards the cathedral. One of the Gargoyles saw him. Adam raised his hands in the air, but as the Gargoyle went in for the attack, Adam walked away.Barachel entered Leonore's room. My queen. We found the creature.High above, the Gargoyles tailed Adam. He glanced up to make sure he was followed. Once out of the alley, he stood in the middle of the road. The rooftops were lined with Gargoyles. He met Leonore's eyes, which flicked to the side as a Gargoyle headed for Adam. Seeing it, Adam charged. With a flying leap, he punched the Gargoyle, which crashed into a parked car. At Leonore's command, more flew at him.As they chased him, Adam ran. His destination: The Wessex Institute. He grabbed onto a Gargoyle that tried to slice him. They crashed through the gate, then flew into the air.Inside the building, Dekar says, Sir. It's here.Him. Not it. Terra corrected.Outside, Adam was now surrounded by demons while the Gargoyles circle above.Leonore watched from above as Adam began to take down demon after demon. This is the place. She whispered. He led us here.Leave him to me. Dekar said as he shoved past the demons. With a roar, Dekar was about to charge. only for a Gargoyle to grab him by the head and pull him into the air, followed by stabbing him with a weapon, effectively descending him. More Gargoyles join the fray. Adam, seeing his chance, heads into the building. Behind him was pure carnage.Lenore saw Molokai run from the building, and noticed a back way into said building.Adam entered the lab. Frankenstein. Naberius greeted. How good of you to come back.I've come to destroy you. And this place. The Gargoyle order must survive. And mankind with it.You cannot... destroy me. Naberius said. And I have many other places such as this... all over the world. As for the order, and mankind, nothing can stop their demise. Let alone a monster like you. Naberius revealed his true demonic form. Adam charged, and managed to slice Naberius several times.Terra tried to shut down the program, only for it to say access denied. Naberius grabbed her by the back of her neck. Too late, Dr. Wade. We already have everything we need from you.He threw her towards the machine, which was shooting electricity. Adam caught her, but his back managed to hit the machine sending volts upon volts of electricity into his body. He dropped Terra onto the floor. After agonizing seconds, Adam fell to the floor.I am a demon prince! You will knell before me! Naberius yelled.Meanwhile, Leonore, Levi and Barachel managed to find Molokai's lab. And on the computer, the reanimation process was 40% complete.Naberius grabbed Adam by the air and pulled him to his feet. He grabbed him by the throat. I know what you want, Adam. What you always wanted. I will make hundreds like you. Thousands. I have been gathering human corpses for centuries. Leonore and her group walked through the large collection of corpses. Each one a host for the legions of demon spirits I will now summon from Hell. On one of the corpses, it read 92%. You will be the first, Using Adam's blood, Naberius drew a symbol on Adam's forehead. You will be one of us. And you will no longer be... alone. He lifted Adam up by his throat, and began to speak in a demonic dialect.Leonore watched in horror as demon spirits started to flow into the human corpses. Many of the corpses began to scream.Your Majesty! The moment they awake they could be possessed! Barachel told her.Destroy them. She commanded. Destroy them all!Terra came too, only to see Adam being held in the air by Naberius.Barachel and Levi continued to destroy the corpses. But then Leonore saw something. A demon spirit that flew upwards. Past the human corpses.The demon spirit wrapped around Adam's leg, then the rest of his body. Adam screamed as he was lifted into the air by the spirit. The flames flew into his eyes.Back down below, as the Gargoyles kept trying to destroy the corpses, a green light appeared on a corpse, followed by 100%. The human stopped screaming and was replaced by a demon. It was quickly destroyed by Leonore.Terra watched as Adam was being possessed. On a monitor next to her, it read 'Initiated Body Release'.Down below, the machine was starting to release the corpses.Adam dropped to the ground. Welcome, my son. Naberius said. You have possessed a truly remarkable body.Adam looked up with a smirk. I am not your son, He wiped off the blood on his forehead. And this body... is mine.No... it's not possible. Adam looked at the cuts he made on Naberius' chest. He picked up a sharp object. You have a soul... Adam took the object and sliced upwards. Connecting that to the three horizontal cuts, he made a blessed Gargoyle mark on Naberius' chest. Adam dove to the side as Naberius exploded in flames. The flames shot out of the entire Wessex building. Even the Gargoyles were forced to dodge it. The flames then curved upwards, before shooting downwards at a high speed.Adam grabbed Terra just as the flames started to dig into the building, but they were caught in the middle. The floor crumbled, and Terra fell. But she was caught by Adam who grabbed her hand.Back down below, Leonore, Levi and Barachel saw the entire ceiling coming down towards them. As the flaming fireball that was Naberius' spirit came down, Leonore charged straight at it.Outside, the Gargoyles watched as the entire building sunk into the Earth. One of them started to fly towards the hole in the ground. He flew over the hole. The fireball continued to travel back towards Hell. Then he noticed something else. Leonore. She was covered in a blue glow, and was carrying both Adam and Terra. Once outside, the Gargoyles headed back towards the cathedral.Inside, Adam gently sat Terra down.He turned to Leonore. Gideon. He started, but she only replied with, 'I know.' Then... why did you save me?Because you finally found your higher purpose.Where's the journal? Terra asked him, in which he said he doesn't need it anymore. Adam offered her his hand, which she took.We do not ask for the lives we are given. Adam narrated. But each of use has the right to defend that life. I have fought to defend mine. Adam stood on a rooftop as he narrated. And when the forces of darkness return, you shall know that I am out there. Fighting to defend yours. I, descender of the demon horde. I, my father's son. I, Frankenstein.

title: Noel
synopsis: Rose Collins (Susan Sarandon) runs into an old high school friend while Christmas shopping in New York City. They exchange small talk and Rose says she is married and has a large family. Smiling uncomfortably, she quickly says goodbye and is next seen entering a hospital. Rose walks down the hall and enters a decorated room where her mother Helen (Una Kay), a patient suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, sits vacantly in her bed. Rose gives Helen some presents and looks across to another room with a comatose patient. Noticing the room is barren and lonely looking, she walks in and hangs an angel figurine on the window. To her surprise, she turns around to see a visitor who introduces himself as Charlie Boyd (Robin Williams) sitting by the doorway. After exchanging some polite but awkward words, she excuses herself from the room.A New York cop, Mike Riley (Paul Walker), sees a beautiful woman, Nina (Penolope Cruz), walking down the sidewalk. He pulls his car up beside her and asks if she needs a lift. After a little verbal banter, the audience realizes that they are not strangers, but in fact joking fiances about to get married.Rose enters her workplace where we learn, through her assistant's remarks, that she is divorced, her father is dead, her sister cannot spend Christmas with her, she sees a shrink, and has been spending the past 10 years looking after her mother. Half serious, her assistant tells her that she needs to get laid. We learn that Rose has a young coworker, Marco (Daniel Sunjata), who is interested in her. Rose thinks this suggestion is absurd due to their age differences, but later agrees to go on a date with him.Mike drops Nina off at work. As he is driving away he sees her embrace another man. Mike automatically assumes the worst.Jules Calvert (Marcus Thomas), sits in a diner talking to Glenn (Merwin Mondisir), about the best Christmas he ever had. It was when he was 14 years old in the hospital due to a broken nose. He talks about how fun and friendly the staff was. Glenn asks about money that Jules owes him and tells Jules to meet him later.Mike enters the same diner to meet his partner Dennis (Sonny Marinelli) for coffee. Artie, a 50-something male waiter (Alan Arkin) gives Mike coffee and complimentary cookies. Artie seems to recognize Mike and treats him with unexpected affection. Mike and Dennis assume the Artie is gay and has a crush on Mike. When they are leaving the diner, the Artie suggests that he had some type of relationship with Mike before and keeps exclaiming, It's been such a long time! No longer wanting to humour the old man, Mike and Dennis tell him he must be mistaken and should stop his crazy behaviour.Rose and Marco go on a date. At dinner, Marco suggests that they go back to Rose's house for a nightcap. She nervously agrees. Marco quickly makes it clear that he wants to sleep with Rose, and although she admits the attraction is mutual, she is too uncomfortable and asks him to leave.Back at Mike and Nina's apartment, Nina and the man she was earlier spotted hugging are decorating a Christmas tree together. Mike enters the apartment and pushes Nina's friend into the Christmas tree, blowing up in a jealous rage. Nina angrily explains that her friend was only there to help her surprise Mike by decorating the tree. Mike still doesn't believe her, and it takes her friend to openly admit that he's gay in order for Mike to fully apologize. Nina leaves and Mike picks up a broken glass angel ornament from the toppled tree.In another part of New York, Jules enters his run-down apartment. Ignoring his landlord who says she's going to evict him. He shuts the door, sits down and looks at old pictures of him and his mother as well as a photo of him at the hospital on Christmas Day.Mike looks out his apartment window and sees Artie, the old man from the diner, staring up at him. Perplexed and wanting to get to the bottom of the matter, Mike invites Artie up to his apartment to talk. Artie hands Mike a wrapped gift.After Marco has left, Rose walks down the street to clear her head and stumbles upon a lively house playing music, with decorations and people dancing in the window. Intrigued, she walks up the stairs to get a closer look when a woman and her children come up the stairs. Startled, Rose helps the woman bring things into the house. Once inside, Rose notices another woman in the living room, crying. It's Nina. Rose asks Nina why she is crying. Assuming Rose is a family friend, Nina confides in her explaining that although doctors said it was almost impossible, she thinks she is pregnant, but has just left her fiance. The family starts to sit down to dinner, and Rose, lonely and yearning for love, entertains the idea that she might be able to have dinner with Nina's family. As Rose hopefully enters the dining room, the family quickly realizes Rose is a stranger. Mortified, Rose runs out of the house. Nina follows and convinces Rose to accompany her to a nearby bar to talk. The two chat, and Rose gives Nina some advice about the importance of holding on to true love.At Mike's apartment, Artie is talking about his wife and how she had the same habits as Mike. Unexpectedly, Dennis arrives at Mike's door in the hopes of cheering him up. Dennis is worried to see Artie there, but reluctantly leaves at Mike's request. Artie then explains to Mike that the reason he is following him is because Mike is his reincarnated wife. Scared and horrified by the old man's passionate admission, Mike throws Artie out of the apartment.After listening to the advice of Rose, Nina visits Mike to give him one last chance. She explains that the only way for their relationship to survive is if Mike can let go of his jealousy and trust her. Mike doesn't seem to understand, and instead interrogates Nina about men who are attracted to her. Nina leaves and Mike follows. She gets into a cab and Mike turns around to find Artie still lingering outside his apartment. Angry, he takes his aggression out on Artie, pushing him and causing Artie to collapse. Artie is rushed to the hospital with Mike by his side in the ambulance.Rose is still at the bar and decides to participate in an open-mic contest where contestants share stories about their hatred of Christmas. Instead of giving a comical performance as expected, she talks about her ex-husband, their unexpected pregnancy, and the death of her premature baby on Christmas. She wins the contest out of sympathy and is given a miniature Christmas tree.Jules meets Glenn at an abandoned theatre where Glenn introduces Jules to an ominous man who breaks hands. Oddly enough, Jules asks the man to break his hands. He does this because he wants an excuse to go to the hospital where he hopes there will be a Christmas party like before.Rose takes her miniature Christmas tree to the hospital to visit her mother again. Feeling emotional, she tells the doctor that she desperately wishes her mother could give her a sign that she understood. The kind doctor tries to comfort Rose by assuring that Helen still senses people and has emotions. Rose plugs in the Christmas tree. The lights suddenly burn out and Rose momentarily loses her composure, throwing the tree onto the floor. Rose looks across the hall to see the comatose man she visited before. Feeling sorry for him, she walks to the doorway and whispers, I love you.Rose leaves the hospital and walks down to a nearby pier, contemplating life. She steps to the edge. A man appears beside her. It's Charlie, the man she saw visiting the patient across the hall. They talk and Charlie says he used to be a priest. He seems well-intentioned and they go to Rose's house to talk some more.Back at the hospital, Dennis shows up and explains that he did a background check on Artie. It turns out that Artie went to jail for manslaughter after throwing his wife's male friend down a flight of stairs in a jealous rage. Artie's fearful wife sped away in a car, got into an accident, and died as a result. Mike clearly sees how Artie's once jealous nature parallels his own. Mike has a strange feeling that there is a reason him and Artie have been brought together, and Mike is determined to find out more.At Rose's house, her and Charlie share their greatest wishes. Rose light-heartedly says her wish is to make it through the night. Charlie reveals a more serious wish not to die alone.Jules is still at the hospital, but wants to leave after he learns there will be no Christmas party. The doctors suspect that Jules broke his own hand intentionally and request that he stay at the hospital for a psychological evaluation.Charlie tells Rose that he left the priesthood because he lost his faith in God. Rose reveals her faith is shaky because no matter how hard she tries, her mother won't give her sign that she's mentally aware.Increasingly irrate, Jules becomes hostile at the hospital and is restrained by security guards.While Mike sits beside Artie's bed, he is greeted by Artie's son, Paul (Rob Daly). Paul tells Mike that his father has been mentally unstable since the death of his mother and is filled with guilt over his past actions. Paul says every Christmas, Artie has delusions about his reincarnated wife.Nina buys a pregnancy test.Jules nostalgically watches a mother caring for her son at a hospital.Mike and Paul talk about Artie's past. Paul explains that Artie is trapped in the past and can't let go because of the guilt he feels for his wife's death. Paul says Artie yearns for his wife's forgiveness.Clothed and on opposite ends of the bed, Rose and Charlie wake up in her room. Charlie looks at a necklace with a cross around his chest. Rose jokes that she survived the night, which was her wish. Charlie says she must have a greater wish than that and Rose admits she wished her life mattered. Charlie insists that her life has tremendous meaning because she cares for so many people. Charlie brings up the fact that she told the patient at the hospital that she loves him. Rose is surprised because Charlie wasn't in the room at the time. Charlie says Rose has restored his faith in God. Charlie then tells Rose that her mother spoke to him and wants Rose to let go and live her life. Rose thinks Charlie is crazy and says she's going to call the police. She doesn't believe Helen talked to Charlie because as far as she's concerned, Helen is incapable of communication. Sad that Rose doesn't believe him, Charlie says I love you and leaves.Jules talks to a psychologist at the hospital and explains his childhood of abuse at the hands of his stepfather. We learn that he was probably at the hospital because his stepfather broke his nose. Jules says that his mother never came to pick him up, and he subsequently left home. He thinks his mother chose his stepfather over him and hasn't spoken to her since. The psychologist tells Jules the only way she'll let him leave the hospital is if he calls his mother. Jules picks up the telephone.In another part of the hospital, Mike is in Artie's room. Knowing that Artie might still be convinced that Mike is his wife, Mike decides to tell Artie that he forgives him for everything and kisses his forehead. Artie breathes a sigh of relief. Mike leaves the hospital to find Nina.Nina takes a pregnancy test at her sister's house.While cleaning her room, Rose finds Charlie's necklace under a pillow. She leaves the house to find him.Mike shows up at Nina's sister's house to find her. Nina's pregnancy test is positive. He tells her that he finally understands and is a changed man. He wants her to give him another chance. He accepts that Nina might not be able to do this, and says no matter what he wants her to be happy. He walks away, leaving Nina with a decision to make.Rose decides to go back to the hospital in the hopes that Charlie is there. When Rose asks a nurse if she has seen a visitor named Charlie, the nurse says Rose is mistaken. Charlie is the patient's name and he never gets visitors. Rose takes a closer look at the patient and realizes that it is indeed the same man, but in a withered and barely recognizable state. The audience is left to deduce that Charlie had an out of body experience in order to communicate with Rose. Charlie opens his eyes and smiles. Rose tells him that it's okay to let go. Rose takes Charlie's hand and places the necklace with the cross in it. She thanks Charlie. Charlie dies. She has fulfilled Charlie's wish not to die alone.Mike returns to his apartment and opens the gift that Artie brought him. He opens it to find a glass angel and redecorates the tree with it. Nina enters the apartment. She says she wants to give Mike his gift. He asks where is it? Nina places his hand on her stomach. They embrace and kiss.Jules is seen leaving the hospital.Rose walks back to her mother's room and sees the doctor feeding her mother. Not knowing that Rose is behind him, he tells Helen that he wants to ask Rose out on a date. Rose asks the doctor what his first name is and he says, Matthew. Rose tells Matthew she would love to go on a date. Rose talks to her mother and asks for her approval, knowing she will probably not reply. To her bewilderment, Helen squeezes her hand. Rose embraces her mother.THE END!

title: A Perfect World
synopsis: A Perfect World, ostensibly about the escape of convicts Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner) and Terry Pugh (Keith Szarabajka) from a Huntsville prison, quickly focusses on their hostage-taking of an 8-year old boy, Philip Perry (T. J. Lowther). The movie opens with the final scene, Butch lying in a field with a Casper the Friendly Ghost mask lying beside him in the grass, a helicopter hovering, and money blowing in the breeze. Both the man and the mask have a faint smile on their faces. The rest of the movie answers the questions posed by that enigmatic opening image.In a small town somewhere in Texas, the town kids are trick or treating except for one family sitting at the kitchen table talking about Halloween. The mother, Gladys Perry (Jennifer Griffin), explains that their religious beliefs put them on a higher plane where such activities are forbidden. Just then the doorbell rings and some children outside yell trick or treat. Gladys answers the door and explains they don't participate in the holiday because they are Jehovah's Witness.Meanwhile, Larry Billings, a prison guard, returns to the prison to get some paperwork to do at home even as the two prisoners in their cells (Butch and Terry) consult with an elderly inmate regarding where the vents go. Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch. Young Philip, who has wandered in, gets on Terry's nerves so he slaps the boy, an action that further infuriates Butch and precipitates a struggle between the two. Butch asks Philip to pick up the Pistola and give it to him. Then Butch says to point it at him and say stick em up, a make-believe playful act, but deadly serious, which he does. A neighbor tries to save the family but Buzz asks him to drop the rifle because he might hit the boy and the neighbor agrees, a pattern of negotiation and violence avoidance that continues throughout the movie. Butch and Terry take the boy, Philip, as a hostage and leave, still in the guard's car.At the state office of the Texas Rangers, Red Barnett (Clint Eastwood) speaks with the Governor by phone. Sally Gerber (Laura Dern), criminologist from Huntsville hired by the Governor to assist Red in matters concerning parole and escapes, introduces herself to Red as one of the team, a fact that does not sit well with Red. The Governor also loans Red's team a shiny new truck and trailer to track the escapees. The rig has lots of bells and whistles and looks suspiciously like a Campaign Headquarters on Wheels with its decorative bunting. While loading up the new trailer prior to starting the manhunt, FBI agent Bobby Lee (Bradley Whitford) is added to the team and Sally is almost left behind.Meanwhile, the escapees and their young hostage are trying to find somewhere to hide out. Terry looks for his cousin's name in a phone book while keeping an eye on Butch and threatening him. Butch responds by breaking his nose. They stop at a store for provisions and Butch asks Philip to train the gun on Terry to hold him in check while Butch shops. Terry starts to play with Philip and try to get the gun away, and resorts to intimidating Philip physically and verbally by casting aspersions on Philips manhood (Kind a puny, ain't it?). When Terry grabs Philip, Philip bites his hand and runs to hide in a corn field across the road, maintaining possession of the gun. Terry searches for Philip even as Butch sees his traveling companions are missing. Butch locates Philip first in the corn field and Philip returns the gun to Butch. Butch shoots Terry. As Butch and Philip get back to the car, the store owner emerges from the store with a rifle but Butch tells him to go lie on the floor of the store until they leave.As the truck and trailer head down the road Red's manhunt team learns about the sighting of the escapees. Sally tells Red they need an auxiliary roadblock because the prisoners will split up. Only one road block is set up. Red and Sally argue about her spot on the team. Red informs her that a strong back side and a sense of humor are the only prerequisites to serving on his team. Sally explains that she is not a moron, she just wants to do her job. Red says that he is in charge and takes responsibility but agrees to listen to her concerns.Butch and Philip continue on as running buddies, drinking RC Cola and getting to know each other. Butch appeals to the boy's desire to play by telling Philip that the car is a time machine and they are driving into the future. He explains gas and brake pedals and that they need to find a Ford to steal.Terry's body is found. Red's entourage continues to follow the escapees.Butch and Philip find a Ford. Butch has Philip play like an Injun and check whether the keys are in the ignition and whether there is a radio. Yes on both counts. While Philip relieves himself, Butch goes to a clothes line to steal some civilian clothes for himself. The farmer who owns the car and the home spots him helping himself. While the farmer runs in from his tractor, Butch jumps in the Ford and fiddles with the starter for an interminable time. The farmer nearly catches the two until Philip bites his hand and he releases his grip on the car.The manhunt team discusses whether locals should shoot if they have a clear shot. Red and Sally say no because of the boy.Butch learns that Philip's dad is gone. They realize they have some things in common: they are handsome, they like RC, and their dads ain't worth a damn. They are on their own and seek foolish destiny.Red gets to the scene of the car recovery. They pry open the trunk and find the dead guard, Larry Billings, inside. Sally barfs and Red shows a smidgeon of compassion.Butch gives Philip an alias, Buzz, so they can go to a store called Friendly's to buy skivvies, britches, rope, and duct tape. Buzz eyes a Casper costume left over from Halloween. A local cop finds the car parked by the store and waits to nab the escapees. The clerk flirts with Butch and gets a nice tip. Butch refuses to buy the Casper costume. Mr. Willits, the store manager, starts to call to report presence of Haynes but Haynes threatens him with a look. Troubles aplenty outside but Butch outmaneuvers them and stops by to pick Buzz up on way out of town. You ain't so friendly, is Butch's take on the clerks screaming at Buzz for shoplifting the Casper costume. The two are a team.Buzz and Butch hide behind a barn while the coast clears. Butch forgives Buzz by saying that although stealing is wrong, the Casper costume theft is an exception to the rule. Buzz is embarrassed by his puny pecker (in the words of Terry). Butch looks at it and declares it good sized for a boy his age. Buzz is heartened by Butch's assessment.Red and Sally believe that Haynes (Butch) and the boy are headed for the Panhandle. Sally outlines Butch's sad life before incarceration. Mom killed herself and Daddy split. After Haynes killed a man who hurt his mom when he was just 8, he stayed clear of the law until he stole a car some years later. Haynes received an inappropriately long sentence. Sally declares that where they are going is not important but why they are going there is very important.Butch trains his navigator in the ways of map-reading. They pass a trailer and wave just for fun. Turns out it is the team of trained criminologists. The trailer does a U-turn when they spot the Casper costume. A chase ensues. The trailer and truck get separated in the process. The Governor's trailer crashes, much the worse for wear. The Governor tells Buzz's mom that the boy is OK as he smiles for the cameras.Butch lets Buzz decide what to do, whether to hoof it or stick with the car. Butch informs Buzz that he is headed for Alaska. Buzz considers the options and decides that 1500 miles is too far to walk. Supply inventory is low, just soda, gum, and half a Moon pie.The Governor wants the trailer back but Red doesn't tell him its condition.With Buzz now sporting the Casper costume, they go trick or treating even though Buzz is a Jehovah's Witness and Halloween is past. Butch tells him how it's done. They go to a woman's house way out in the country, and she says that he is too late. He missed the popcorn balls. When she sees Butch's gun, however, she changes her mind and gives them whatever she has, including money. They feast on the spoils, mustard sandwiches.Later, while Buzz sits in the car alone waiting for Butch to check out the road block, the car starts rolling. Buzz finally sorts out the brake from the accelerator and stops it. Then it happens again. A guy out with his family almost hit by the car buys their story about bad brakes and agrees to take them along in their car, enabling the pair on the lam to get through a checkpoint.The mom in the car with Butch and Buzz blesses her children out and slaps them for spilling a drink in the new car. Butch's face clouds over and he decides to have Bob let them out of the car. Then he kicks the family out with their suitcases and steals their car. The next scene is of the family approaching one of the roadblocks on foot.Red and Company are getting hungry. They find steaks and tater tots in the trailer and Red starts cooking them up. Bobby Lee tries to put the make on Sally but Red cuts it short to ask Sally how she likes her steaks cooked. Then Red sets the would-be suitor Bobby Lee straight about the mission.Butch and Buzz talk over the limitations of the Jehovah's Witness religion. Butch introduces Buzz to the fun side of American life by allowing him to ride on the car roof. Later, they stop for dinner and Butch hopes for a side order of nookie from the waitress. Buzz watches out of curiosity. When Buzz is discovered, the couple's mood is dampened. Butch and Buzz get back on the road not fully replenished. They discuss women and love.Butch and Buzz hide in a corn field to lay low, plan their journey, and catch some sleep. Buzz tells Butch he wants to return home and Butch promises to return him soon. Butch reassures him of his concern for the boy by asking him to make a list of all the stuff he wants to do, such as eat cotton candy, and says he will try to make certain he gets a chance to do some of it.Sally asks Red whether he was a sheriff when Haynes got his long sentence for stealing the car. Red said Butch's dad was a crook, bad news, and Red thought it would be better for Butch to send him away from the household to an institutional setting. Regret was in his eyes.A sharecropper, Mack (Wayne Dehart), finds Butch and Buzz in the corn and offers them a place to sleep and Butch agrees. Mack hits his grandson, Cleve (Kevin Jamal Woods), upside the head and Butch does not approve. The two families eat breakfast together the next day and get to know each other. Butch shows Cleve a gymnastic trick like skinning the cat and they practice a little. Butch plays some old 45's and invites Mack's wife, Lottie (Mary Alice), and the boys, to dance. Butch talks about growing up in a whore house watching his mama dance. Mack hears about the manhunt on the radio and the mood changes quickly: Butch threatens him to secure his silence. The farmer's family gets tied up with their mouths taped shut, and Butch is ready to kill Mack for hitting his grandson.Trust is the topic of conversation and it is clear that Buzz does not trust Butch as much as he did because of Butch's hairpin temper. Buzz shoots Butch in the gut, crying the entire time. Then he throws the gun in the well, throws the car keys on the ground, and runs away. Butch, bleeding profusely, shows mercy and leaves his pocket knife on the table so Mack and his family can use it to free themselves after he leaves. Philip crawls under a fence and runs through a field, leaving a bit of his torn costume on the fence. Butch follows him telling him he's a hero and agrees to let him drive if he will continue on as his running buddy. It is clear, however, that they have reached the end of the line. Philip climbs a tree. Butch is slowly dying from his wound but he continues to follow the boy. Butch asks Philip to go with him to Alaska and he reads the message from his dad on the back of the postcard out loud to Philip. Philip apologizes for shooting him. Butch says he was glad it was Philip who shot him and not some stranger.Butch and Philip are surrounded by cops. Shotguns abound and Bobby Lee, the FBI agent, gets out a high-powered rifle with a telescopic site and prepares to shoot Butch. Red talks to Butch via a megaphone. Negotiations begin and end with a threat to kill the boy even though the pistola is in the well. Gladys, Philip's mom, arrives on a helicopter and she pleads for Philip's life. Philip trick or treats the group of cops and Butch negotiates for Philip's future fun, not his own life. When Philip tries to say that his Mom lets him do a lot of great stuff, Butch is skeptical: Don't kid a kidder, Philip. Butch makes her promise to allow him to go to fairs and trick or treat and Philip vouches for her veracity as a real good mama. Butch asks him to walk toward the cops and yell, Trick or treat! The running buddies shake hands goodbye. Philip, still dressed as Casper the Friendly Ghost, starts to go to his mom but returns to Butch who is dying. Philip is worried they will shoot Butch. They hug and begin to walk toward the cops very slowly, hand in hand. Red walks out to talk to them but tells Bobby Lee to keep him locked down, clean as a whistle. Red drops his gun on the ground and tells Butch to drop his gun. Butch says Pistola is gone, thanks to his partner. Butch tries to hand the postcard to Philip but Bobby Lee, looking through his scope, thinks Butch is reaching for a weapon and shoots him, a mortal wound. Buzz weeps over him. They run and grab the boy as Red looks on and winces.Red punches Bobby Lee for improper discharge of his weapon. Sally gives Bobby Lee a knee to the groin for good measure. The last scene is Butch in the field again as in the first scene. Only now it is clear that Butch is a ghost too.

title: Stalag 17
synopsis: Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the spirits of the other POWs.================================A few days before Christmas, 1944, at the German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag 17, two American POWs, Manfredi and Johnson, inmates of Barracks 4, are preparing an escape. The story's narrator, Cookie, one of the prisoners, suggests that there may be a traitor among the men of Barracks 4.The men have secretly been digging a tunnel from their latrine to a point just beyond the barbed-wire fence that marks the perimeter of the camp. After going over their plan to sneak into Switzerland, Manfredi and Johnson get out of the barracks through a trap door hidden under the wood-burning stove and sneak into the latrine. They crawl through the tunnel and begin digging to the surface beyond the barbed wire fence.Inside the barracks, the men speculate as to how long it will take their comrades to emerge beyond the fence. They begin to predict that the escapees will make it all the way when one of them, a shrewd man named Sefton, wagers two packs of cigarettes that the men won't even make it out of the nearby forest. The other men, most of whom dislike Sefton, wager against him.Outside, Manfredi and Johnson dig to the surface and are about leave when they are spotted by a small German squad outside the fence, who open fire, killing them both. Inside the barracks, the remaining prisoners, including Sefton, are disheartened, knowing their buddies could not possibly have escaped. The hot-headed Duke demands an explanation from the barracks' security officer, Price. Price says he doesn't have an answer. Meanwhile, Sefton and Cookie quietly gather up the cigarettes that Sefton has won in the bet and store them in a footlocker Sefton keeps under his bed.The next morning the entire camp is awakened for roll call. Barracks 4 is overseen by Sergeant Schultz, a jolly man whom the men have absolutely no trust for. In the camp's muster grounds, the men are addressed by the camp commandant, Oberst von Scherbach. Scherbach tells the men that his guards successfully prevented the escape from night before and that no man has ever escaped from his camp alive. He also has the corpses of Manfredi and Johnson lying in the mud and uncovered for all the men to see. The Barracks 4 chief, Hoffy, protests the treatment of the bodies and demands they have a proper burial. Von Scherbach agrees to do so. Von Scherbach goes on, saying that being caught outside the barracks after lights out means summary execution. Also, the stove in Barracks 4 will be removed so it cannot be used to camouflage the trap door the men cut in the floor.Von Scherbach also announces that each barracks will be given a small Christmas tree and that all the prisoners will go through delousing. One of the prisoners, the shellshocked Joey, begins to play his ocarina, which is gently taken away by another prisoner, Stanislaus Animal Kazawa. While the commandant talks and uses a mocking tone, Animal throws the ocarina at the water in front of the commandant, splashing his highly polished boots with mud. The Commandant demands the guilty man step forward. Animal does and is followed moments later by several other men. Eventually, the entire prisoner population steps forward, covering for Animal. The Commandant, temporarily flustered, cancels the Christmas trees and tells the men they'll be deloused with cold water from the camp's fire hoses. The men are dismissed.After the men have the opportunity to clean up in their latrines, and following a small incident where Animal is nearly shot for crossing the barbed-wire of the camp while lusting after Russian female prisoners, the men go back to their barracks for breakfast. Sefton fries himself an egg in front of the other prisoners and when questioned about how he paid for it, he tells them that he bartered for it using the cigarettes he'd won the night before. The other men are quite angry that Sefton would use cigarettes he'd gotten as a result of the deaths of their comrades, however, Sefton counters, saying that many other prisoners trade with the Germans and that life in the camp is such that thievery is common. One of the other prisoners, Duke, who has a short temper, tells Sefton that collusion with the Germans could get him hurt or killed and small fight breaks out. Hoffy promptly breaks it up and Sefton, claiming he has indigestion, gives the fried egg to Joey. Price, the barracks security officer, asks Sefton how he could be so sure that Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't make it to freedom. Sefton says he didn't know for sure but he liked the odds of the situation. Sefton also angrily tells his comrades that they're wasting their time and risking their lives unnecessarily by trying to escape. Sefton plans to ride out the war as a prisoner and stay alive.The barracks of the camp share a ham radio that they keep hidden and use to listen to the BBC and other communications about the war. The radio is smuggled throughout the compound by Marko and his partner, Steve, who is on crutches having lost a leg in combat. They use his empty pantleg to hide various items, including the radio. When the radio is brought to Hoffy and Barracks 4, Marko tells them they can have it only for two days; the traitor in their barracks is known to the rest of the camp and the other barracks chiefs fear the radio will be discovered. The men set up the radio immediately, using a few yards of chicken wire as the antenna, which doubles as their volleyball net. One of the prisoners, Blondie, is a radio expert and begins to report about military actions in Europe; the news he picks up is about the famous Battle of the Bulge. Just then, Schultz arrives to seize the barracks stove and the radio is cleverly hidden in a pail of water. Hoffy and Duke try to grill Schultz about the barracks spy but Schultz refuses to tell them anything. Schultz also notices that a signal from the spy has been left for him; a loop has been tied in the cord for one of the bare light bulbs hanging from the rafters. After he barks orders for the men to leave, he goes to the chess board and takes the black queen. Pulling off the crown, he sees a small note rolled up and hidden inside. He exchanges the queen for an identical piece, pulls the loop out of the cord and walks out.While the men uncover the escape tunnel they dug, they notice a horse-drawn cart going by with the coffins of Manfredi and Johnson. The men all remove their hats in respect. Cookie narrates for a while about Sefton himself who, despite the poor conditions of the camp, has built a substantial entrepreneurship for himself based mostly on the trading of cigarettes. Sefton has several successful businesses at his disposal including distilling schnapps from potato peels, horse races (he uses mice that run around a small track), and a telescope that the men use to peek into the delousing shack in the Russian compound where female prisoners are disinfected. Hoffy, Price and Duke are not pleased with Sefton's ventures, fearing that the Germans will find out and punish them more harshly than ever.A new prisoner arrives; Lieutenant James Dunbar, who is being housed at 17 until the Germans ship him to the officers camp. Dunbar is greeted warmheartedly by the rest of the barracks. However, there is instant friction between him and Sefton. Sefton tells everyone that Dunbar is from a wealthy family and should be pampered during his stay. Dunbar lets the first few comments go but tells Sefton that he can resent his family's wealth but he should tread cautiously. Sefton tells Dunbar that his family fortune won't protect him in the camp. Sefton leaves the barracks, to an unknown destination.The rest of the men ask Dunbar about how he was captured & brought to the camp. He was shot down on a bombardment mission and had been on his feet for three days without any sleep. He'd have been brought to Stalag 17 earlier but there was a major delay coming out of Frankfurt: a German munitions train was destroyed just outside the city and snarled much of the Reichsbahn transport for miles around. The sergeant that accompanied Dunbar, Bagradian, tells everyone that it was Dunbar himself that blew up the train. Dunbar is modest about the incident but tells everyone that he'd rigged a simple time bomb and tossed it aboard the train as it was leaving the station.Schultz shows up unexpectedly and confiscates the radio, playing coy for a bit before revealing it's hiding place in the bucket. After he leaves, the men turn on Cookie, demanding to know where Sefton has been for the past few hours. With Hoffy's permission, Animal breaks into Sefton's footlocker & discovers a wealth of contraband that Sefton's been hoarding. Duke suddenly appears and tells them that he knows where Sefton disappeared to: he's been over at the Russian women's barracks partying with them. In a fury, Hoffy smashes Sefton's prized telescope.When Sefton returns, he finds the men staring angrily at him and that his footlockers have been broken into. Hoffy and the rest of the men suggest that he's the German spy they've been unable to identify. The Commandant suddenly makes an appearance and arrests Dunbar for suspicion of sabotaging the train that was destroyed near Frankfurt. Dunbar is taken into custody and the men become angrier with Sefton, immediately suspecting him. They turn on him and he is brutally beaten.The next morning the men are rousted out by Schultz. Sefton is unable to get out of bed and Schultz notices that he's been severely beaten. Sefton tries to bribe Schultz into revealing the identity of the traitor but is rebuffed. When the other prisoners walk in on them, they're belief in Sefton as the traitor is reinforced. Hoffy tells Sefton that he tried to get Sefton transferred to another barracks but couldn't. Sefton tells everyone that he'll find out who the traitor is.On Christmas Eve the Geneva agent inspects the camp and brings Red Cross supplies for the men. A mistaken shipment leaves the men with a large supply of ping-pong balls. That night the men celebrate with a small tree they decorate with their dog tags. The solemnity of the evening is ruined when the camp lights go out & Schultz tells them all to evacuate and take refuge in the trenches used in case of bombings. Schultz waits until everyone leaves and begins talking to Price, who is the traitor. He shows Schultz how Dunbar sabotaged the train using nothing more than a book of matches and a lit cigarette. After they leave, Sefton steps out from a hiding spot, having heard the whole conversation.On Christmas Day the men throw a party in their barracks with music and much of the liquor and wine that Sefton had been hoarding. Sefton talks to a suspicious Cookie about the traitor in their midst. Sefton talks about the potential consequences of revealing the traitor to the others & what punishment they'd face if they killed the man outright. Sefton suggests that a well-constructed plan to rid themselves of the traitor and appear blameless is needed.Hoffy shows up and announces that the SS has arrived to take Dunbar into custody -- his method for destroying the ammo train has been uncovered. Hoffy tells the men that they've come up with a plan to rescue Dunbar from the SS. All the men from the other barracks will disperse outside and help with a diversion. Sefton seizes the opportunity to demand that he stay in the barracks & be guarded by someone they trust -- Sefton suggests Price.Outside, the men have Steve drop a smudge pot crafted from ground ping-pong balls from his empty pantleg onto the ground near the SS agents car. When the cover from it is thick enough, a small group of the men rush the SS guards and grab Dunbar, hiding him. The commandant is furious and runs checks of every man against their records. The barracks are searched and the prisoners are forced to stand in the appelplatz for six straight hours, however Dunbar is never found. It is later revealed that Dunbar is hiding out in one of the water towers above one of the latrines.That night Hoffy calls a meeting where they'll draw the name of the man who will get Dunbar out of the water tower and out of the camp through the barbed wire. When the name is drawn, Price takes the tag and says he'll go. He figures that his work as barracks security chief has been less than adequate and he'd like to make it up to the men. Another trap door is cut in the floor and as he prepares to leave, Sefton steps forward and announces another wager that Dunbar will never make it out of the camp. The men are instantly furious with him but he slowly begins to reveal Price as the traitor. Price slips up during interrogation, proving that he'd left the United States and had gone back to Germany when the war broke out. He tries to escape through the trap door but is easily caught and subdued. Sefton then tells everyone that he'll be the man to get Dunbar out -- he likes the odds because now they can use Price as a decoy. They'll throw him out the door with cans tied to his leg and he'll be fired upon by the Germans in the guard towers.Sefton slips down through the trapdoor, bidding everyone farewell and sneaks over to the latrine. He gets a freezing Dunbar down from the water tank and waits for the signal from his comrades. When Price is thrown out into the appelplatz he draws fire from all the towers, despite his cries for help in German. As he desperately tries to approach the commandant's offices, he's gunned down. At the edge of the camp, Sefton cuts through the wire fence and he and Dunbar escape into the woods. In the appelplatz, the commandant and Schultz first smile at the corpse lying the mud but are quickly chagrined to find that it's not Dunbar, but Price. In the barracks, the men reflect on how well Sefton's plan worked. The Animal suggests that Sefton merely wanted to steal their wirecutters. Cookie happily begins whistling the theme of the Army Air Force.

title: Batman Begins
synopsis: The film's story is divided into three time-lines:-Blue represents the present-Red represents close flashbacks, which deal with Bruce Wayne 3 years earlier-Green represents distant flashbacks, which deal with Bruce Wayne aged 8 years oldIn the present and close flashbacks, Bruce Wayne is played by Christian Bale and Rachel Dawes is played by Katie Holmes. In distant flashbacks, Bruce Wayne is played by Gus Lewis and Rachel Dawes is played by Emma Lockhart.A large swarm of bats fly from left to right of shot. Back-lighted by a reddish sky, they make the shape of Batman's emblem.Distant flashback: Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes are playing in the Wayne Manor garden. Bruce falls down an sealed up well and fractures his arm. He is then attacked by a swarm of bats emerging from a large gaping crack at the well base.Present: Bruce wakes up from the nightmare in a Chinese prison. It becomes apparent that Bruce is regularly attacked by other inmates who brawl with him 6 to 1 at breakfast. Having beaten the majority of them, Bruce is punished with solitary confinement by the prison guards. In solitary, Bruce is approached by a man called Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard displays a great deal of knowledge and authority by getting an audience with Bruce from the prison and by stating that he knows who Bruce is. Ducard then offers Bruce a place in the League of Shadows -- a collective of vigilantes and assassins. He deems that the League can offer Bruce a path to true justice instead of 'locking himself away with criminals to take them on one at a time.' Ducard arranges for Bruce to be released in the morning, when he will have to decide whether he will accept Ducard's offer. Should he do so he must pick a rare blue flower from the eastern slopes and carry it to the top of a nearby mountain.Bruce is released, as promised, and carries out his task. After carrying the flower to the top of the mountain, Bruce finds himself at the door of the League of Shadows headquarters. Inside he meets Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the head of the League, and is confronted by Henri Ducard once again. Bruce hands over the blue flower and in doing so completes his test for membership. Ducard then suddenly attacks him, warning the exhausted Bruce that 'death does not wait for you to be ready.' Although Bruce fights back he is easily beaten and collapses.Distant flashback: Bruce is still in the well after being attacked by the bats. His father, Dr. Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), comes down to rescue him and sets Bruce's fractured arm with the help of the family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine). Thomas Wayne comforts Bruce by asking 'Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up'. Later on Bruce admits to his father that he was scared of the bats and is now suffering nightmares. After being comforted further, Thomas shows his son the pearl necklace he'll give to his wife as a gift.That night, Thomas and Martha take Bruce to the opera via monorail. While on the train, Thomas confides that the city is in an economic downturn, and his company Wayne Enterprises funded the construction of the trains, routing them into the center of the city. Thomas, however, leaves running of the company to more interested people, preferring to work as a doctor at the hospital. While watching the opera Mefistofele Bruce is frightened by the bats in the production, which remind him of the bats that attacked him and asks his father if they can leave. Outside, in an alleyway, a man named Joe Chill (Richard Brake) accosts them with a revolver and demands the pearl necklace Thomas gave to Martha. A fight breaks out, and in the struggle, both Thomas and Martha are shot and are mortally wounded. Chill runs away, leaving Bruce alone with his parents. Before dying, Thomas manages to tell Bruce, Don't be afraid....That night, Bruce is watched after at the police station by officer James Gordon (Gary Oldman). Midway through, police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Colin MacFarlane) comes in and informs Bruce that the police have caught Chill.Bruce is put into Alfred's care. After the funeral, Wayne Enterprises CEO William Earle (Rutger Hauer) tells Bruce that the company will be looked after until Bruce grows up. Alfred tries to console Bruce when the boy confesses that his parents' deaths were his fault because he asked to leave the opera early.Present: Ducard asks Bruce if he still feels responsible for the death of his parents. Bruce responds that his is far too angry to feel guilty. His training with the League of Shadows begins. He is trained in the arts of ninjitsu, stealth, combat theatricality and deception. Bruce is trained not only to fight 6 men but to 'engage 600.'Ducard enforces his belief that all forms of crime must be fought without mercy and pity. Ducard explains that his wife was murdered and that he joined the League when he achieved his vengeance. Bruce reveals that he can't claim his vengeance.Close flashback: 14 years after his parents were killed, Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor from Princeton University; he's come home for Joe Chill's parole hearing. Alfred still manages the house and expresses his concern over Bruce. Rachel is now an Assistant District Attorney and takes Bruce to the hearing. Unknown to her, Bruce is concealing a revolver, with which he plans to shoot Chill if he is released.In the hearing, Chill expresses remorse for the murder of Bruce's parents and is given parole should he testify against his cellmate, gang boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). However, before Bruce can act, a female assassin posing as a reporter comes up with a pistol in hand and shoots Chill. Bruce watches as Chill bleeds to death and the assassin is arrested.Driving away after the incident, Rachel lectures Bruce afterward on the difference between justice and revenge and reveals that Gotham City is still suffering because of Falcone's illegal drug empire. Rachel then slaps him harshly when he reveals that he was planning to shoot Chill. She tells him that his father would be ashamed of him.Bruce, convinced that he has nothing to lose, makes his way to a bar in the Gotham underworld to confront Falcone. Falcone brags about his control over the city's police and judges, even pointing out who he has in his pockets who is present. He then threatens Rachel and Alfred to prove that Bruce does have a lot to lose. His thugs beat up Bruce and he leaves. Left no other choice but to run away, Bruce stows away aboard a cargo ship leaving the port.Bruce is then shown in China stealing food to survive and eventually getting involved in gangster operations in order to infiltrate them. He is then arrested - ironically, in the act of stealing Wayne Enterprises crates - and sent to the prison Ducard discovered him in at the beginning.Present: When Bruce reaches a skill level in which he is an equal to the majority in the League, he faces Ducard in combat. However, he is exposed beforehand to the vapors of the blue flower he brought up to the mountain earlier. The smoke distorts his senses and makes him hallucinate about bats, his greatest fear. Bruce overcomes his phobia and employs a clever trick to best Ducard in a sword fight, passing the trial.Ra's al Ghul sends for him and Ducard. Ra's puts Bruce to one final task before becoming a full member of the League. The task is to execute a prisoner of the League -- a man who has stolen his neighbour's land and killed them. Bruce refuses -- when Ducard tells him that his compassion will be a weakness, Bruce tells him that it's too important to simply deny. Ra's reveals to Bruce that he has been trained in order to lead the League to Gotham City, which is corrupted by evil to such an extent that it must be razed. Bruce sets a diversion, and lights the League's headquarters on fire and is forced to fight al Ghul while the the rest of the League escapes the wreckage to safety. Ducard is knocked out by Bruce who then manages to fend off Ra's, who is killed instantly when a roof beam collapses on him. Bruce picks up an unconscious Ducard and rescues him from the building as it explodes. Bruce leaves Ducard in the care of a villager.Bruce contacts Alfred, who arrives in a private jet to pick him up. Alfred reveals that Bruce, who has been away for seven years, has been legally declared dead by William Earle so that Earle can take Wayne Enterprises public. Bruce says it's a good thing he willed everything to Alfred, who jokes that Bruce is welcome to borrow the Rolls-Royce....so long as he brings it back with a full tank. Bruce explains to Alfred a plan he has to fight the Gotham underworld by taking on a new persona, which all criminals will fear.In Gotham, a serial killer named Victor Zsaz (Tim Booth), who is allegedly insane, is being transferred from a regular prison to the Arkham Asylum on the opinion of Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy). Rachel challenges Crane since Zsaz is yet another one of Falcone's thugs that Crane has had moved to the Asylum and away from prison, and goes unnoticed due to Falcone's corrupt influence. Dr. Crane meets with Falcone later on that night and demands that Rachel be dealt with. When Falcone refuses, Crane threatens him with the knowledge that his unknown boss is coming to the city -- Falcone is clearly intimidated by the mention of Crane's employer.Holed up in Wayne Manor, Bruce begins to work out what has happened since he has been away. While doing so he spots a bat flying around the ceiling. He goes back to the abandoned well and climbs down. Through the crack in which the bats appeared when he was attacked in his childhood, Bruce finds a huge cave filled with bats, which is connected to the lowest foundations of Wayne Manor. Coming to terms with his fear he establishes the cave as his base of operations.Bruce decides to announce his return and reports to Wayne Enterprises, where he makes a dramatic entrance to his own company's building by seducing a secretary into playing office golf. Earle, clearly shocked, warns him that he cannot prevent the company from going public at this later stage. Bruce explains that he is not bothered by this and that all he wants is a job, preferably in Applied Sciences.Earle sets this up and Bruce goes to meet his new 'boss', his father's best friend Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Fox explains to Bruce that the Applied Sciences Department is a dead end, where Earle can reassign employees he considers troublemakers. Fox introduces Bruce to some of the equipment he's invented, that Bruce finds worthy. One is a special bulletproof Nomex survival suit, a Kevlar suit that will stop knives and any gun but a straight shot. It was meant for military use, but it apparently never caught on because the Army didn't think soldiers' lives were worth the $300,000 cost. Other items Fox shows to Bruce include a grappling gun and a safety harness. Bruce casually asks Fox if he can 'borrow' the gear for spelunking. Fox allows it, considering all the equipment to belong to Bruce anyway, though he is curious why Bruce is expecting to run into a lot of gunfire in the caves he's exploring.Bruce continues to explore the cave where he and Alfred find the lower foundations of the southeast wing of Wayne Manor and an old elevator shaft leading back up the house. Bruce also begins to modify the battle suit he borrowed adding bat-shaped gauntlets and spray-painting it a dark black.A few nights later, Bruce dons a ski mask and the grappling gear, goes to the police station, and breaks into Gordon's office, recognizing Gordon, who since we last saw him has been promoted to sergeant, to be one of the city's few incorruptible cops. By threatening him with a staple gun behind his back, Bruce questions Gordon on what it would take to bring Falcone to justice. Gordon responds that leverage on the corrupt Judge Faden and a D.A. brave enough to prosecute will be needed. Bruce tells him to watch for his sign, then escapes by jumping off the roof across to the next building, injuring himself in the process. Gordon tries to give chase, but it proves worthless to chase a random nut.Bruce realizes now that he needs a lightweight fabric to make a glider wing or parachute. He goes back to Fox and asks if there is any technology there that would suit him for 'BASE-jumping.' Fox shows him a special material called memory cloth, which is designed so that the molecules realign to form any type of rigid shape when an electric current passes through it. Bruce then takes interest in a tank-like vehicle called the Tumbler. As he drives it around an open warehouse floor, Fox explains that it was built as a bridging vehicle for the army. It is able to accelerate to high speeds, is tricked out with a variety of gadgets and weapons, and has a booster rocket that can send the vehicle into a rampless jump. At the end of the session, Fox asks Bruce what he thinks of the Tumbler. Bruce only has one question: Does it come in black?Back in the cave, Bruce adds further modifications to his suit, adding a radio transmitter, a cowling, the memory cloth, and a utility belt. He makes steel shurikens in the shape of a bat. He explains to Alfred that he has chosen the bat as his symbol because bats frighten him and it's time that his enemies shared his dread.At the docks, Falcone and a corrupt police officer, Arnold Flass (Mark Boone Junior), are watching Falcone's thugs unload a shipment of drugs from an inbound cargo ship. The drugs are concealed in toys -- stuffed bears and rabbits. The bears are to go to the drug dealers and the rabbits to a mystery man in the Narrows -- a poverty-stricken area of Gotham overrun by crime. However, three of the thugs mysteriously vanish leaving nothing but a loud scream as they vanish into the darkness. As the others investigate, more disappear. The Batman quickly disposes of the remaining thugs and attacks Falcone.Gordon and his officers arrive to find the drugs and disarmed thugs at the scene and Falcone bound to a searchlight with his coat cut in such a way as to produce the shadow of a bat in the night sky.Meanwhile, Rachel is getting off a monorail train, while being shadowed by two of Falcone's thugs. She notices one and threatens him with a taser. He runs in fear when he sees Batman beating up the second thug. As Rachel turns she screams at the sight of Batman. He produces photographs compromising Judge Faden and then disappears as a police officer shows up.The news the next day of a 'Batman' has the whole city talking. Loeb is not happy that a vigilante is doing the job the police are meant to do, in spite of Gordon's defense that the vigilante did hand them Falcone on a platter. Rachel and the D.A.'s office decide that there is enough evidence to put Falcone on trial despite it been given to them by a vigilante.Alfred wakes Bruce up at 3:00pm in the afternoon, despite Bruce's pleas for more sleep, and then frets over the bruises and injuries that he has taken the previous night. He informs Bruce that he must live the life he would normally in public in order not to raise suspicion - doing such things as drive exotic sports cars, date movie stars, buy things that are not for sale, etc.Earle, meanwhile, gets word that a Wayne Tech Enterprise weapon, a microwave emitter, has been stolen from one of their cargo ships, and the crew of said ship has apparently been killed. The emitter is another military weapon, which uses focused microwaves to vaporize an enemy's water supply.Bruce takes Alfred's advice quite to the extreme. This starts with him going to a Wayne Enterprises party at a hotel with two female escorts, who almost get Bruce kicked out by bathing in the decorative fountain, a situation Bruce resolves by writing a check and purchasing the hotel on the spot. There he meets Rachel for the first time since returning from China. Although he tries to convince her that the way he is acting isn't really him, she tells him that it's not who you are underneath, but what you do that defines you.Falcone has cut his wrists in prison to bolster his insanity plea and enable a move to Arkham Asylum. Dr. Crane is brought in to assess his insanity. Once they're alone, Falcone demands that Dr. Crane move him in return for Falcone not suggesting the police have a closer look at the drugs he has been trafficking for Dr. Crane. Dr. Crane thinks for a moment about what to do. He then asks Falcone if he wants to see the mask he uses in his experiments at the Asylum, which he says the patients can't stand. He pulls a burlap-sack mask out of his briefcase. He releases gas from his suitcase and puts on the mask, which acts as an air filter. Falcone screams with fear at the hallucinations caused by the gas. Dr. Crane is next seen leaving the room with his masked stored away, while Falcone's screams can still be heard. Dr. Crane tells the warden that Falcone isn't faking and should be moved to the Asylum.The following night Batman pays a visit to Gordon and tells him that only half the drugs brought in on Falcone's ship were to be sent to the dealers. He and Gordon conclude that it would help to interrogate Flass, who Batman identified at the docks making his escape. Flass is pickpocketing money from a falafel vendor on the street. As he walks away into a narrow alley, he springs a trap and is flown upside-down to the rooftops, suspended from Batman's grappling cord. Threatened by Batman, Flass tells him about the bear and rabbit shipments, that the rabbits make their way to the Narrows, and that there is some other substance hidden in the rabbits. Batman returns Flass to the ground and disappears. Meanwhile, Rachel's boss, Carl Finch, is quietly murdered by an assassin disguised as a police officer when he finds Wayne Enterprises' missing microwave emitter in one of Falcone's containers.Batman makes his way back to the Narrows and finds an apartment stuffed with cuddly rabbit toys stuffed with the drugs. At that moment Dr. Crane and two of his men enter and Batman hides. At Dr. Crane's orders, the thugs douse gasoline around the apartment. Batman comes out of hiding and beats the two thugs. Dr. Crane, wearing his burlap mask, emerges and gasses him with the same gas he used on Falcone, using gas cylinders hidden in his shirt cuffs. Batman falls helplessly to the floor and scrambles around hallucinating bats and his parents' death. Dr. Crane douses him in gasoline while taunting him. He then lights a cigarette lighter and throws it at Batman's chest, causing his suit to burst into flames. Batman throws himself out of the window into the rain swept streets of the Narrows and hits the street with a thud. Desperately rolling around he puts out the flames, to the shock of the on-lookers, and then stumbles about trying to get his grapple gun. He fires the gun upwards and is carried to to a nearby rooftop. From there he grabs his communicator and calls for Alfred to help him. He's still suffering from the hallucinations. Alfred arrives and takes Batman into the car and drives him to the Manor. Batman tells him to 'take poison...blood...blood poison', before passing out.Hearing his father's voice asking 'Bruce, why do we fall?, Bruce wakes up in his bed as if from a nightmare. Alfred reveals that he has been unconscious for two days and that today is his birthday -- 'many happy returns.' Bruce tells him that he has felt the effects of whatever Dr. Crane used on him before but not as strongly. Fox comes in and warns Bruce against 'hanging out in the wrong nightclubs' and after making a point of how hard he has worked to save Bruce, explains that he has created an antidote to the toxic gas. When asked if he could make any more of the antidote, Fox expresses concern that Bruce is willing to 'go back to the same club' and gas himself again, but he promises to bring what he has. He also explains that the antidote will inoculate people against the toxin.Rachel turns up at the Manor to give Bruce his birthday present and to apologize that she can't make his birthday party that night. Her boss has been missing for two days; she jokes bitterly about searching the river for his body. She cuts away from the conversation as she get a text message informing her that Falcone has been moved from prison to Arkham on Dr. Crane's orders. She rushes off to challenge Dr. Crane's decision. Knowing the she is in danger from Dr. Crane, Bruce changes to Batman, despite the guests who will soon arrive for his party.Rachel arrives at Arkham and watches Falcone -- now genuinely insane -- mumbling the word Scarecrow over and over. When she questions Dr. Crane on the meaning of scarecrow, Dr. Crane explains that a significant number of inmates focus their paranoia on an external tormentor, such as a scarecrow. Both are unaware that Batman is listening from outside. When Rachel demands that Falcone be evaluated by Dr. Lehmann, the court's psychiatrist, Dr. Crane leads her into the lower floors of the Asylum, where he reveals inmates who are pouring a toxin into the water pipes below. Rachel runs for it but Dr. Crane catches her, now wearing his burlap mask, and gasses her with his toxin. A terrified Rachel is interrogated by Dr. Crane in the basement. Suddenly the lights go out. Dr. Crane acknowledges that the Batman has arrived. He tells the guards not to worry about Rachel as she has been given a concentrated dose and will not last long, but to phone the police. He explains that the police can't stop the toxin, but Batman might -- unless the police stop him first.Although Dr. Crane's henchmen are prepared, Batman appears in the basement and overcomes them all easily. He gasses Crane with his own toxin. He interrogates Dr. Crane, who lets slip that he is working for Ra's al Ghul before passing out. Batman picks up Rachel and takes her high up on the landing before the huge stairway at Arkham's entrance. The police arrive. Not willing to wait for backup in the form of a SWAT team as Flass is, Gordon goes into the building and is grabbed by Batman. The SWAT teams arrive. Batman explains to Gordon that he needs to get Rachel to his hideout so he can give her the antidote to the toxin. But Batman can't escape the SWAT team while carrying Rachel, so he asks Gordon carry her to the alley outside on the Narrows side. He then activates a device in the heel of his boot, which emits a high-pitched scream. Gordon takes Rachel down the stairway as the SWAT crew raids the building. As they begin to set up, a huge swarm of bats breaks into the building in response to Batman's signal. With bats everywhere distracting the SWAT officers, Batman drops from the stairway using his cape to land safely. He breaks into the prisoners' area, courteously apologizing for disturbing the inmates, and uses explosives to break outside. There he meets Gordon and takes Rachel from him.Batman refuses further help from Gordon, knowing he can't take him too, and gets into the Tumbler. He hurries Rachel back to the Manor, with police cars and helicopters in hot pursuit. A very dramatic car chase ensues as Batman weaves through parking garage ramps, over church roofs, underground tunnels, and highways, destroying multiple police cars with evasive manuevers and caltrops to blow out their tires, and makes it back to the cave. He finds that Fox has delivered three vials of the toxin antidote, one of which he uses to save Rachel.Gordon gets a report from the detectives studying the toxin in the water. Gotham's whole water system is laced with the stuff; it must have taken weeks to prepare the material. No one has noticed anything up to now because the toxin apparently has no effect unless it's inhaled.Meanwhile, Rachel wakes up inside the cave and Batman explains what has happened. He tells her he is going to sedate her and when she wakes up she will be at home with the two remaining vials of the antidote. She must get them to Gordon -- one for him to inoculate himself and one for mass production. He sedates her and gets changed for his party.Bruce tells Alfred about Rachel and asks him to take her home. He goes to the party downstairs to a chorus of Happy Birthday. He meets Earle ,who tells him that the stock offering was a success; the buyers were mostly trusts and brokerages. Bruce finds Fox and thanks him for the antidote vials that he delivered. Bruce then tells him what has happened. Fox interrupts that the water won't help disperse an inhalant. He stops and thinks. He says the stolen the microwave emitter could vaporize all the water in the mains, releasing the toxin. He reveals that he has been fired by Earle for asking too many questions about it. Bruce asks him to break into Wayne Enterprises and begin making more antidote.Bruce is carted off unwillingly to another section of the party by Mrs. Delane. When she insists that he must meet a man called Ra's al Ghul, she suddenly has Bruce's attention. As the figure turns around, it is clearly not Ra's. Bruce whispers that he watched Ra's die. A familiar voice from behind asks 'but is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural?' Bruce turns around to the sight of Henri Ducard. Bruce thinks slowly before figuring out that Ducard is the true Ra's and the man Bruce fought back at the League of Shadows HQ was a decoy. Ra's muses that they both have double identities. He then lectures Bruce on the weakness of compassion. Even though Bruce had saved his life, he will still destroy Gotham.Ra's gives Bruce a chance to get the innocent guests out of the house, which he does by acting drunk and insulting them. After Bruce demands his guests leave him in peace, he and Ra's walk together. Ra's explains that Crane's fear toxin is derived from the blue flowers back in China and that he found a way of weaponising it. Crane, however, is not a member of the League of Shadows and his idea of the plan was that they would hold the city to ransom. Ra's explains that Gotham must be destroyed because of how corrupt it is -- which he illustrates by explaining that the League of Shadows has infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. The scene is intercut with a series of shots showing members of the League disguised as officials and police officers releasing people from Arkham -- including Victor Zsaz and Crane, who, still under the effects of his own fear toxin, only mumbles 'scarecrow.'Back at the Manor, Ra's offers Bruce one last chance to join and help the League, which Bruce refuses, claiming that there are still good people in the city and that Gotham isn't beyond saving. Ra's nods to other League members, who set fire to the mansion. Ra's explains that Gotham has been attacked by the League before through economics, which caused the depression when Bruce was a child. Ra's hoped that the city would destroy itself through the unequal distribution of wealth, however certain members of the rich families, such as Bruce's parents, donated money to help Gotham recover. But Ra's is back to the finish the job. With this Ra's attacks Bruce and pushes him in the way of a falling beam which pins an unconscious Bruce to the floor. With Wayne Manor burning around him Ra's says 'Justice is balance. You burned down my house and left me for dead. Consider us even.'Meanwhile the Narrows is in a state of panic as hundreds of rapists and murders are freed from the Asylum. Rachel wakes up in her bed with the two vials of antidote.Alfred arrives back at Wayne Manor and uses a golf club to knock out a League member guarding the house. Praying that the man was not a member of the fire department, Alfred rushes into the burning house and rouses Bruce. Managing to free himself, Bruce is led to the cave by Alfred as the house collapses.Alfred inspects Bruce for injuries as Bruce is torn about the destruction of his father's house. Alfred tells him that the Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar and quotes Thomas Wayne: 'Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.'Police in full strength are moving from central Gotham across the bridge to the Narrows island. Rachel, being a D.A., is allowed to pass. She finds Gordon and gives him the antidote. Gordon explains that they are going to raise the bridges to the island and they need to get Rachel off before they do.One last SWAT van is allowed over to the Narrows secretly carrying Ra's, a handful of his henchmen and the microwave emitter. A train, on the overhead Wayne line is stopped by the League where the Microwave emitter is being prepared to be hoisted up to it. While the drawbridges are raised, Ra's sets off the machine causing all of the water in the pipes below the streets to vaporize and blow the pipes open in the Narrows. The toxin is released and affects everyone in the Narrows including the escaped convicts and the police alike. Gordon inoculates himself with the antidote and finds a fearful Flass ready to shoot two innocent and equally frightened teenagers. Gordon knocks him out and handcuffs him to a railing. Meanwhile the few remaining people of the Gotham Police force wonder what is going on.The Narrows begins to tear itself apart. In the streets, people violently attack one another. Rachel is confronted by Crane on a horse whose previous rider, a riot cop, is dragged behind. Wearing his burlap mask, Crane announces to her his new alias, 'the Scarecrow.'Gordon requests reinforcements but to his dismay he is told that all of the riot police are already on the island and there is no one left to send. Suddenly the Tumbler shoots across the gap from Gotham to the Narrows. Batman explains to Gordon that Ra's intends to use the train to carry the microwave emitter to Wayne Tower. When the train reaches Wayne Tower at the center of Gotham, the microwave emitter will vaporise the contents of all the water mains, covering the whole city with the toxin. He asks Gordon for help and gives him the key to the Tumbler.The Scarecrow is about to run down Rachel. She fires her taser and hits him in the face. His horse carries him away screaming. Rachel is surrounded by a dozen inmates from Arkham, including the serial killer Mr. Zasz, carrying a knife. Batman jumps from above them, cracking Zasz over the head, picks up Rachel and carries her to a rooftop and to safety. As Batman leaves her she asks him who he is. He replies 'It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me' -- quoting her own words back at her. She says 'Bruce?' as he jumps from the rooftop and uses his memory cloth cape as a glider. As he seemingly flies in the air, the fearful people below shriek in terror as their hallucinations warp the sight of him. Gordon orders the main bridge to be lowered and starts up the Tumbler.Ra's is overseeing the madness below as his men fasten the microwave emitter into place on board the train. He spots Batman gliding towards him. Batman lands on the train platform. Ra's comments that he took his advice on theatricality a bit too literally and boards the train. Four members of the League appear and prevent Batman from pursuing. During the fight, Batman tries to uses his grapple hook to secure himself to the train but it is knocked out of his hand. The fight takes all participants down to the street floor where Batman manages to overcome all four League members. However he is ganged up on by dozens of terrified and angry citizens. As Ra's starts the train overhead, Batman finds his grapple gun and fires it at the train. He's dragged behind the train. Gordon meanwhile is following the Tumbler's GPS system toward Wayne Tower.As the bridges are lowered, Ra's's train breaks the water pipes, releasing the toxic gas. The Tumbler is not far behind. Batman manages to pull himself to the train. He smashes through one of the train windows and engages an infuriated Ra's. Batman takes Ra's sword and breaks it in two with his gauntlets. Distracting Ra's, he stabs the sword into the braking controls of the train. Gordon arrives at Wayne Tower. He arms the Tumbler's defense systems and fires missiles at a train rail foundation. With the train approaching Wayne Tower, Ra's gets the upper hand over Batman and taunts him: 'Don't be afraid, Bruce. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.' Batman replies, 'who said anything about stopping it?' Ra's looks up and notices a half of his sword sticking in the brake control. As this happens Gordon destroys the foundation and breaks the railway line. With this distraction, Batman regains the upper hand and pins Ra's. Batman explains that he won't kill Ra's -- but he doesn't have to save him, either. He blows out the back end of the train car, throws himself out, and glides away. Ra's can only look up to watch the train propel itself off the line and into the street below. The microwave emitter gets damaged by the impact and explodes, destroying the whole train.The next day, Earle arrives at Wayne Enterprises to chair a meeting. He'd shocked to find that the meeting has already begun -- and is led by Fox, who reveals he has Earle's job.Bruce is in the back of his car reading a newspaper: Batman has made the front page and Bruce is on page 8 under the headline 'Drunken Billionaire Burns Down Home.' He takes a call from Earle, who asks on what authority Bruce can decide who runs Wayne Enterprises. Bruce states that he is the owner. Earle reminds him that the company has gone public. Bruce explains that he bought most of the shares through various trusts and brokerages. Fox agrees with Bruce's words, and asks Earle, Didn't you get the memo? in reference to the words Earle told him when firing him from AS.Back at Wayne Manor, Bruce is nailing boards over the old well in the garden when he is approached by Rachel. He apologizes for not telling her about his identity earlier. She apologizes for slapping him the day Chill died and for the horrible things that she said before he disappeared. Bruce tells her that what she said was true and that he was just a coward with a gun. He thanks her. She says that when she heard that he was back she began to hope. She moves closer towards him and kisses him. She then explains that she then found out about his mask -- his actual face. She explains that his true face is the cowl of Batman and that the boy she loved long ago never came back. But maybe one day they can be together when Batman is no longer needed. Bruce nods. Rachel tells him that she was wrong and that Bruce's father would be proud of him, just as she is.Alfred is walking through the rubble of the Manor and Rachel asks Bruce about what he will do. Bruce replies that he'll rebuild it just the way it was before. Rachel turns to leave. Alfred wonders if it's a good time to improve the foundations of the south-east corner. Bruce agrees and they walk off.That night, Batman meets Gordon, who reveals that he has recently been made a lieutenant. Gordon has also made a version of the signal that Batman had made with Falcone. Gordon talks about the escalation between law enforcement methods and criminal methods such as the police wearing Kevlar leading to criminals buying armor-piercing ammunition. He expresses concern that the city's dependence on Batman may have negative consequences. Gordon uses a recent case as an example. A criminal with a taste for theatrics has killed two people. The suspect leaves a calling card at the scene of each crime. Gordon gives Batman the evidence: a Joker playing card (see The Dark Knight). Batman says that he will look into it. Batman then assures Gordon that they can make Gotham safe again and he jumps from the roof and glides away.

title: The Warriors
synopsis: As night falls over Coney Island, Cleon (Dorsey Wright), leader of the Warriors, meets up with eight of his most trusted lieutenants to travel by subway to the faraway Bronx. They will be attending an event called by a man named Cyrus, described as the one and only. Throughout the city, other gang delegations are seen entering the subway in their full colors. As the Warriors speculate about the event during their subway ride, we learn that Cyrus, leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs, has called a truce of all the gangs in New York. He wants an unarmed delegation of nine from each gang to come to a mass meeting to hear what he has to say. Some of the Warriors are excited at the prospect, while others are skeptical.At Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the meeting is well-attended with over 100 gangs represented. The charismatic Cyrus (Roger Hill) takes the stage and delivers a spellbinding speech. He says that, instead of fighting each other over turf, they could unite to form an army of 60,000 soldiers, compared to only 20,000 police in the whole city. He punctuates his points with Can you dig it? to the crowd's wild response. Outside the meeting area, the police are seen silently moving in.Most of the crowd is enthralled with Cyrus' vision, but one member has his own agenda. Luther (David Patrick Kelley), the psychotic leader of a gang called the Rogues, has snuck a gun into the gathering. At a high point in the speech, Luther fires at Cyrus, killing him instantly. When Cyrus falls back, there is a brief stunned silence, followed by pandemonium. The crowd was so fixated on Cyrus that hardly anyone saw who fired the shot, but Luther turns to see that Fox (Thomas G. Waites) of the Warriors witnessed the assassination, so he points the gun to kill Fox. Just at that moment the police spotlights come on, blinding Luther.Cleon walks towards the middle of the chaos, to see whether Cyrus survived. Luther begins screaming to the crowd, That's him! The guy who shot Cyrus! Another member of the Rogues also claims to have seen Cleon shoot Cyrus. Cleon denies it, but Luther continues to scream The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it! and charges at Cleon. Cleon holds his own in a fight against the Rogues, but then the Gramercy Riffs, martial arts experts, step in and bring Cleon down with kicks and elbow hits. Cleon presumably has been killed.The other Warriors break through a wooden fence to make their escape, winding up in a cemetery as the rest of the police rush into the park and the various gangs flee. They take a head count and determine that everyone is there except for Cleon. Swan (Michael Beck), who as war chief is the second-ranked member after Cleon, states they are going to the subway, to catch a train back to Coney Island. A member named Ajax (James Remar) gives Swan some trouble when he asks: Who made you leader? Swan advises him to make his move, but the remaining members intervene, telling Ajax to calm down and urging everyone to stick together. Ajax backs down for now, and they make their way toward the subway, worrying whether the truce is still on. If it isn't, they will have to bop (fight their way) across other gangs' territories, vulnerable because they are wearing their colors and are not packed (armed).Meanwhile, the Gramercy Riffs' new leader, Masai (Edward Sewer), addresses the Riffs at their underground hideout. He wants the Warriors, alive if possible. The Riffs inform a local DJ (Lynne Thigpen), and she puts the word out on the radio, urging all local gangs to be on the lookout and capture or kill the Warriors, the gang that broke the truce, for the Riffs. She dedicates the song Nowhere to Run to the Warriors. As the song plays, gangs throughout the city are getting ready to hunt down Cyrus' assassins.The Warriors wait for a train outside an elevated train station, so that they will not be ambushed on a open platform. Ajax complains that they are acting like wimps, but the others' caution is justified, since a school bus filled with a tough-looking skinhead gang known as the Turnbull ACs begins patrolling the area. When the train arrives, the Warriors make a break for it and barely make the train ahead of the gang. Masai is informed of the Turnbulls' failure. Meanwhile, Luther gets a telephone update from an informant and learns that the Riffs have put the word out on the street that they want the Warriors alive. The Rogues don't want the Warriors taken alive, for fear of the stories they might tell. Luther tells his crew that they can do some looking too.The celebrating Warriors' journey home is cut short when a fire on the tracks delays the train. They have no choice but to make their way to the next station on foot. That route takes them directly through the Bronx territory of a small gang known as the Orphans, who did not attend the gathering at Van Cortlandt Park and apparently don't know of the contract out on the Warriors. After determining the Orphans' numbers to be at least 30 versus their eight, Swan decides a diplomatic solution would be best. He brings Fox with him to meet with the Orphans' leader (Paul Greco). After a bit of tough posturing, the leader accepts the explanation of the subway fire, buttered up a bit by Fox's respectful comments, and tells them they can move through the territory if they come in peace. However, his girlfriend Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) begins taunting him with chicken noises and cutting comments. The leader's manhood is now insulted, so he orders the Warriors to remove their gang colors if they want to proceed through their territory. Swan refuses in no uncertain terms, and the Orphans leave while the Warriors march on.The curious Mercy tails the Warriors, and gets caught by Ajax. She claims to want some real action. Just then, the Orphans show up again, packed and ready to rumble. They throw some tough words around, but Snow (Brian Tyler) produces a Molotov cocktail, which Swan throws at a car near the Orphans. The Warriors take off past the flaming vehicle. The car explodes, the Orphans fail to pursue, and the Warriors hightail it to the next station with Mercy. She seems determined to stick around for the ride.The DJ passes on the news of the Orphans' defeat.Luther gets another update that the Warriors are making their way through and that the cops are out to get every gang in the city. When asked why he seems so happy about this situation, Luther responds I'm having a good time!The train at the 96th street station is not moving and the frustration of the Warriors, especially Vermin (Terry Michos), is obvious. A police officer walks by the car, and they take off running. During this escape they split into three separate groups. Fox and Mercy run down the platform. A cop comes from behind one of the pillars, and tackles Fox. Fox yells at Mercy to run away, and in the struggle the cop tosses Fox onto the tracks, where he is killed by an oncoming train. Mercy is running in the other direction and doesn't see Fox's death.Vermin, Cochise (David Harris), and Rembrandt (Marcelino Sanchez) manage to evade the police and board a subway train to Union Square, the agreed upon meeting place if they are split up. Ajax, Swan, Snow, and Cowboy (Tom Mckitterick) also outrun the police and exit the station at the front door, only to find a bigger potential threat - a group of men in baseball uniforms, their faces painted, leisurely swinging baseball bats. The Baseball Furies have been waiting for them. The four Warriors take off running down the street. The chase continues into Riverside Park. Swan and Snow split to the side, leaving Ajax and Cowboy running forward. The Furies fail to see the split, and follow Ajax and Cowboy. Swan and Snow circle to the Furies' backs. Cowboy can no longer run, so Ajax turns to face his foes, with Swan coming up from the rear. In the ensuing melee, Ajax's and Swan's fighting skills shine. They succeed in wresting control of bats and eventually in laying out all of the Furies.The DJ announces the Baseball Furies' defeat and disparages all the gangs for their poor performance.Meanwhile, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt have arrived at Union Square to wait for the others. They see a group of six young women giving them come hither looks. Cochise and Vermin can't believe their luck in finding attractive chicks who seem to want to party with them, naively failing to realize that the women are lesbians. Only Rembrandt, the youngest Warrior, senses the danger. They go to the group's clubhouse and the leader (Lisa Mauer) identifies them as the Lizzies, an all-girl gang and says that they want to get down with the Warriors because they have heard of their reputation. Cochise and Vermin waste no time heading off to couches with their choice of girl. Rembrandt stays aloof and says that they need to get back. He notices the women exchanging glances, but before he can react, the door is locked and the leader pulls a gun and says So you guys are the famous Warriors? The guys who shot Cyrus. Rembrandt shouts a warning and the three crash through a door, dodging bullets to escape. Rembrandt informs the others of what he has learned; that the women thought the Warriors shot Cyrus. They finally realize that every gang in the city must be looking for them.Swan and his crew continue walking through the park. They pass a lady on a bench (Mercedes Ruehl), who gives her best smile. Ajax decides to play games with the woman, and won't be dissuaded even after the others press on him the need to get home. Ajax disparages the others' manhood and turns back toward the woman. A few minutes later, Cowboy and Snow decide to go back to look after Ajax, and Swan continues to the station alone. The woman turns out to be an undercover cop, and Ajax is arrested when he tries to assault her. There's nothing Cowboy and Snow can do, so they make their way to Union Square.When Swan gets back to the 96th street station, he finds Mercy still hanging around. A cop spots them, and the two wind up running into a tunnel. Holed up in an underpass off the tracks, Mercy comes on to Swan. He insults her and says he wants to find something better. Mercy declares that Swan isn't any better than her. Swan continues on to Union Square and Mercy follows him. The Punks, who's leader wears roller skates, spot Swan on the subway platform and hang around waiting for their chance.Meanwhile, Snow and Cowboy have made it to Union Square and meet up with Cochise, Rembrandt and Vermin. Swan sees his fellow Warriors and signals them to lead the Punks into the men's room. They hide in the stalls, and ambush the Punks with Rembrandt's spray paint. The ensuing battle, which Mercy joins on the Warriors' side, is another victory for the Warriors.Back at the Riff's headquarters, Masai is told that there is a new witness who saw who really shot Cyrus.The six remaining Warriors board the final train home, with Mercy still in tow. Two young couples in evening dress coming from a school prom present such a contrast to Swan and Mercy that Swan takes pity on Mercy and clumsily signals that he accepts her.Upon arrival at Coney Island, the sun has risen, and the journey is seemingly over. The Warriors and Mercy walk through the deserted Coney Island streets, only to realize that Luther and the Rogues are following them in a car. With no time to contact other members to come to their defense, the Warriors take shelter under a dock. Swan now has a switchblade he took from the Punk leader; the others arm themselves with what's around: Furies baseball bats, crowbars, hockey sticks, two-by-four pieces of wood, etc. Luther makes an ominous rattling sound with beer bottles and chants Warriors, come out to play-ay!Swan leads his crew and Mercy out to the beach, and the Rogues follow. Finally face to face, Swan asks Luther why he killed Cyrus, to which the crazed Luther replies: No reason. I just... like doing things like that. When Luther pulls a gun on Swan, he manages to flick his knife into Luther's wrist, disarming him. At that moment, the Gramercy Riffs appear in force on the beach. Swan asks whether the Riffs are still looking for the Warriors, to which Masai replies, looking at Luther, that they have found what they're looking for. Masai praises the Warriors as good, real good, and makes an exit path for them. They file out to the screams of Luther's death agonies.As the DJ announces that the alert is cancelled, the six surviving Warriors walk down their hometown beach, Swan hand-in-hand with Mercy. They are glad to have made it home, but are also emotionally defeated because they know that they and all the New York City gangs are back where they started from: nowhere.

title: The Fisher King
synopsis: Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), a cynical, arrogant shock jock talk radio host, becomes suicidally despondent after his insensitive on-air comments inadvertently prompt a depressed caller to commit multiple murders at a popular Manhattan bar. Three years later, while heavily intoxicated and depressed, he attempts suicide. Before he can do so, he is mistaken for a homeless person and is attacked and nearly set on fire by ruffians. He is rescued by Parry (Robin Williams), a deluded homeless man who is on a mission to find the Holy Grail, and tries to convince Jack to help him. Jack is initially reluctant, but comes to feel responsible for Parry when he learns that the man's condition is a result of witnessing his wife's horrific murder at the hands of Jack's psychotic caller. Parry is also continually haunted by a hallucinatory Red Knight, who terrifies him whenever he shows any confidence.Jack learns that Parry had slipped into a catatonic state following his wife's death and had remained there for a few years. When he emerged he seemed obsessed with the tale of the legend of the Fisher King, a form of which Parry recounts to Jack. The legend varies, but all iterations possess three elements: the Fisher King was charged by God with guarding the Holy Grail, but later incurred some form of incapacitating physical punishment for his sin of pride, and had to wait for someone to deliver him from his suffering. A simpleminded knight named Percival, referred to in the movie as The Fool, healed the wounds with kindness to the king, asking him why he suffers and giving him a cup of water to drink. The king realizes the cup is the grail and is baffled that the boy found it, as demonstrated in the closing exchange: I've sent my brightest and bravest men to search for this. How did you find it? The Fool laughed and said I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty. Echoes of the legend recur throughout the film, but in a continually shifting manner, so that it sometimes appears that Lucas is Percival to Parry's Fisher King, sometimes vice versa, and sometimes that one or the other is re-enacting part of the story with another character (most obviously in Parry's self-assigned quest to obtain the Grail from the man he believes is its guardian).Jack seeks to redeem himself and help Parry find the Grail and find love again. Jack sets Parry up with a woman Parry has been smitten with from afar, Lydia, a shy woman who works as an accountant for a Manhattan publishing house. Jack successfully introduces them to each other and sets up an equally successful dinner date (Jack and his strong-willed girlfriend, Anne, join them). Following dinner, Parry declares his love for Lydia but is once again haunted by the Red Knight. Parry tries to escape his hallucinatory tormentor but is attacked by the very thugs from whom he had earlier rescued Jack. The beating is not fatal but causes Parry to become catatonic again.Jack promises to find the Grail for Parry. He infiltrates the Upper East Side castle of a famous architect and retrieves the Grail, a simple trophy. When he brings it to Parry, the catatonia is broken and Parry regains consciousness. While he and Jack lead the patients of the mental ward in a rousing rendition of How About You?, Parry is reunited with Lydia and Jack (who had earlier broken up with Anne for dubious reasons) reunites with his love as well.=====================The story opens in a radio broadcast studio where arrogant and cynical shock jock Jack Lucas talks to a caller about the banality of the social scene in New York City (where his show is broadcast). The caller tells Jack about a bad date he'd had recently, sounding quite despondent over being rejected by a woman. Jack tells him, in a largely dismissive tone, that social status dictates that the caller will never be successful if he tries to enter this woman's more aristocratic social circle. Jack's show ends for the day and he returns to his lush penthouse where quarrels briefly with his girlfriend (whom leaves) and admires himself, repeating his tagline (FORGIVE me!!). Jack turns on the news and finds out that the despondent man he'd been talking to had killed several people in a popular Manhattan restaurant with a shotgun. Jack is devastated, blaming himself for the man's breakdown.Three years later Jack is off the radio & morbidly depressed, living with a woman, Anne, who owns a video store downstairs from her apartment. Jack drinks heavily and works part-time for Anne. When Jack offends a chatty customer, Anne tells him to go back to her apartment and get some rest. That night, Jack, while watching a television show he's produced based on his radio experiences, insults Anne, saying that he's only lived with her for sex. Anne storms off and Jack leaves the apartment, taking a bottle with him. Mistaken for a bum on the street, a small child gives him a wooden Pinocchio doll. Jack ends up near the Manhattan Bridge at the East River, feeling suicidal with cinder blocks tied to his ankles. While he prepares himself to jump in the water, he's attacked by two young men who believe he's a vagrant; they beat him severely, douse him with gasoline and intend to burn him alive. Just as they light a match, they are attacked by another bum who speaks much like a medieval knight and wields a non-lethal bow and arrow. Several other bums join him and sing How About You? and Jack's would-be killers are quickly outnumbered and defeated. One of the killers is captured and tied up by the vagrants' leader and left to be victimized by anyone who comes along. Jack is initially terrified of the leader, who is suddenly kind and takes him to a safe area under a bridge, populated by more homeless men. Jack spends an hallucinatory night with them, even impressing them all when his coat briefly catches fire, causing him to dance around in a panic.The man takes Jack back to his home, the maintenance room in the basement of an apartment building. The man tells Jack his name is Parry and that he's a knight on a sacred quest; Perry believes the Holy Grail is in the home of a prominent architect living in a castle-like building on the Upper East Side. Parry also hints that he is often visited by the little people, hallucinations that advise him on the quest. Parry, however, is terrified of the Red Knight, a large, monstrous enemy that rides a black horse and breathes fire. Jack also notices that Parry has a small shrine dedicated to a young woman to whom he's infatuated, however, Parry yanks him away from the shrine when he discovers him there. Parry believes that Jack has been sent to aide him in his quest. Jack tells Parry openly that he's crazy and leaves. As he walks out he meets the building manager who at first thinks Parry has invited someone to live with him. The manager tells Jack that Parry used to live in an apartment in the building a few years ago before his wife was murdered. The manager goes on to say that Parry's wife was killed in the same tragic restaurant shooting incident that Jack believed he caused.Jack goes back to Anne's apartment, finding her distraught at his disappearance but happy to see him alive. He explains what happened the previous night and how he was attacked. Jack realizes that much or all of his depressive state can be relieved if he helps Parry. He asks Anne about the Holy Grail and she pontificates on the nature of good and evil and God and the Devil. The two of them have sex. Later, Jack tells Anne that he feels he's cursed because of the trouble he believes he caused Parry and she tries to comfort him.Jack revisits Parry's home and is met by the manager who tells Jack more about Parry: his real name is Henry Sagan and he was a professor of medieval studies at Hunter College. After his wife was killed, he fell into a catatonic state and lived in an asylum on Staten Island. One day he simply awoke from his catatonia and became Parry. He was taken back to his old apartment building where the manager allowed him to live in the basement. The manager also tells Jack that Henry was deeply in love with his wife.Jack finds Parry in the Midtown area of Manhattan, sitting atop a parked car, oblivious to the alarm blaring. Jack offers Parry money for compensation, however, Parry gives it to another homeless man. Jack is angry, but Parry grabs him, pulling him behind a column. A woman, Lydia, has emerged from the skyscraper, the same woman that Parry had built the shrine to in his home. She is at once clumsy and awkward, finding it difficult to negotiate her way past people and through the building's revolving door. Parry and Jack follow her to a Chinese restaurant where they watch her through the window. Later, she stops at a news stand, where she buys a new novel, a habit that Parry has noticed; she buys a new book every few days. After she returns to work, Parry tells Jack that he's deeply smitten with her but lacks the self-confidence to approach her. Just then Parry's nemesis, the Red Knight, appears. Jack cannot see the monster; it is a hallucinatory manifestation of Parry's own fear that only he can see. However, Parry yells that the Red Knight is uncharacteristically afraid of Jack and drags Jack along on the chase. They race through Central Park until Jack, lagging behind, finds Parry sitting on a rock. Parry tells Jack that their combined effort has frightened the Red Knight off. The pair hear screaming and happen across another homeless man who had buried himself in the dirt of a horse trail in the park, hoping that riders will trample him. Jack and Parry take him to a homeless shelter where Jack comforts the man while Parry tries to stir the other patients into song. Jack talks briefly with the man they rescued who tells him he's a cabaret singer and a veteran who watched all his friends die.Later, back in Central Park on the Great Lawn, Jack lays on the grass with Parry next to him. Parry is nude, unafraid of the danger in the park at night, and gazes at the clouds and stars and tells Jack the story of the Fisher King, who once possessed the Holy Grail but lost it, grew old and became depressed. The king was saved by a passing fool who gives him a drink of water; the cup he uses is the Grail itself and the king is revived. Parry says he has a vague memory of a lecture he gave on the story as a professor before his mental breakdown. Jack suggests that Parry needs to be introduced to Lydia and says he'll help him.Jack returns to Anne's place and formulates a plan to have Parry meet Lydia socially. He poses as a contest official and tells Lydia she's won a free membership at Anne's store. Lydia is not so easily fooled and hangs up on Jack. Jack sends the cabaret singer to Lydia's office; the man does a flamboyant musical number informing Lydia she won the membership.Lydia shows up at the video store. Parry is there too, posing as an employee. Lydia's membership is squared away and Parry helps her find a few movies to rent. She doesn't find any she'd like but notices that Anne has a fancy manicure. Anne tells her that she does her nails herself and she'll do Lydia's for a reasonable fee. Lydia agrees and Anne invites her to her apartment that night. Jack will meet them there later with Parry and they'll all go to dinner. Jack gives Parry his wallet to pay for dinner.Anne and Lydia talk about Lydia's need for self-confidence. Jack helps Parry clean up for dinner. The four go to a Chinese restaurant where the plan to get Lydia and Parry together is successful. Jack and Anne go back to Anne's place and Parry escorts Lydia home. Lydia expresses many assumptions about Parry, believing that he'll stay with her one night and leave. Parry tells her that he's quite in love with her and promises to contact her again. As he leaves, Parry's abnormal fear hits him, he sees the Red Knight and runs screaming into the night. He ends up at the same spot where he found Jack when Jack attempted suicide. A few moments later, while Parry lies on the ground, twitching uncontrollably, the same two punks who tried to kill Jack find him - both are standing on either side of the Red Knight. The punks beat him severely.The next day Jack calls his old radio agent and tells him he'd like to get back on the air. Anne comes on to Jack, however, Jack asks to talk to her seriously; Jack thinks that he needs to break up with her because his career may once again take off. Anne is instantly furious and upset and argues with him. Just then, Jack receives a phone call from the police; they found Jack's wallet on Parry when he was brought to a hospital. At the hospital, Anne and Jack find out about the assault and that Parry has become catatonic again. Parry will be remanded to a mental hospital until he regains his mind.Jack settles quite easily back into his previous life as a radio host, however, his arrogance and insensitivity have mellowed greatly. He is also in talks to produce a television talk show. While in a meeting with a TV executive, Jack leaves unexpectedly and visits Parry, bringing him the Pinocchio doll he'd gotten from the child. Jack tells Parry that he knows Parry wants him to steal the grail from the castle on the Upper East Side, however, he also refuses to do it. Jack demands that Parry wake up, to no avail, and finally promises to undertake the dangerous mission.Using Parry's plans and notes, Jack makes use of a slingshot to carry a rope and anchor to a parapet and the high tower of the castle. He makes it inside and creeps down the long staircase. About halfway down, he sees the man who shot Parry's wife and recoils at the hallucination. Jack finds the castle's study and the Grail, which turns out to be a trophy given to a Lanny Carmichael. Jack hears a noise behind him and finds Carmichael slumped in an easy chair by the fireplace, having taken an overdose of medication. Jack tries unsuccessfully to wake the man up, choosing instead to leave by the front door, tripping the security alarm.Jack once again visits Parry and gives him the cup. Exhausted, Jack slumps on Parry's bed and falls asleep. Some time later, Parry's fingers, holding the cup, begin to caress it. Parry wakes up and tells Jack that he really misses his wife.The next day, Lydia visits Parry and finds his bed empty. Parry and Jack are leading the other patients in a rousing rendition of How About You?. Parry sees Lydia crying and hugs her, asking her why she looks so sad. Jack continues to lead the other patients in song.Jack goes to Anne's store and reconciles with her, admitting he loves her. She slaps him but accepts him back into her life. The story ends with Jack and Parry nude in Central Park, watching the clouds and laughing.

title: Neko no ongaeshi
synopsis: A young girl named Haru awakens to another day, where it seems she's a few steps behind everything. Rushing to school, she comes in late for class, to mocking laughter from her classmates, and even from one guy in her class whom she has a crush on.After school, walking home with her friend Hiromi, Haru curses her misfortune. As they walk down a busy street, they see a dark cat carrying a small box in his mouth. In the middle of the street, the cat drops it, and attempts to pick it up, unaware that a large truck is heading towards it! Haru grabs her friend's lacrosse stick, and running into the street, saves the cat, before collapsing into some bushes and breaking the lacrosse stick. Unseen by anyone but Haru, the cat then stands on it's hind legs, and thanks her for saving him. It then gets back on all fours, and rushes off. When Haru relates the incident to Hiromi, her friend can scarcely believe it either.Later that evenin, Haru tells her Mother about the incident. Her Mother explains that it sounds like something that happened when Haru was little. Supposedly, a dirty white kitten was following her as she ate fish crackers. Haru then took pity on the kitten, and gave her the whole box. Haru's Mother claims that Haru told her that the kitten talked to her, but Haru doesn't recall anything like that happening.Later that night, Haru hears something outside, and sees a procession of cats walking down the street. Then eventually stop outside Haru's house, and she comes outside. Among the procession are the Cat King, his Prime Minister Natori, and a servant cat named Natoru. Natori explains that the Cat King thanks Haru for saving his son, and she is presented with a scroll, that gives information about numerous gifts she will receive for her good deed.The next day, Haru wakes up, wondering if it was a dream. Her ponderings are soon put to rest when a number of things happen. Her friend Hiromi has awoken to find numerous lacrosse sticks outside her door. At Haru's place, cat tail plants surround their house, and as she heads to school, a number of cats chase after her (Haru surmises that she must have some catnip on her). At school, she is freaked out when she finds a number of individually-boxed mice in her shoe locker.Getting over the shock, she goes about the day, taking Hiromi's clean-up duty upon her request. While taking out the garbage, she sees the guy she has a crush on, walking by with his girlfriend. This distracts Haru and she trips and falls, feeling more miserable than the day before. Suddenly, she sees the King's assistant, Natoru, who becomes shocked when Haru yells at him regarding the 'gifts' she has received. Noting that she seems upset, Natoru offers to take her to the Cat Kingdom for a personal tour, and even tells her of the additional gift she will receive for her good deed: the chance to marry the Cat King's son, Prince Lune. This shocks Haru, who then starts to wonder if being among cats wouldn't be so bad, since they seem to have very few responsibilities. Natoru takes this as a 'yes' answer, and rushes off, leaving Haru distraught at the idea of her (a human girl) marrying a cat! As she panics, a disembodied voice tells her to find a white cat at the crossroads, who will lead her to the Cat Bureau.Haru goes to the specific location, where she finds a large white cat. The cat doesn't say a word, but she follows him through all sorts of little nooks and crannies, until he reaches a small embankment of shops that almost seem doll-like in size. Here, the large white cat gets up on his hind legs, and heads to a small storefront. As he does so, the setting sun catches on the windows surrounding them. The front door of the building opens, and a cat in a suit emerges, giving his name as Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, but Haru decides to just call him 'Baron.' Baron cites the large white cat as Muta, and as they talk, a stone statue comes to life, which Baron says is named Toto.Baron invites his guests into his home, where Haru explains about her predicament, and how a strange voice told her to seek out the Cat Bureau. The Baron decides that he and Muta will make a visit to the Cat Kingdom in regards to Haru's request for their help. However, the Baron requests that Haru never forget who she is, as this will be very important. As they speak, there is a knock at the front door. Haru answers it, only to find Natoru there, and a number of cats who carry Haru off, intending to take her to the Cat Kingdom. Muta manages to catch up with them, but Baron and Toto lose their trail.Haru wakes up in the Cat Kingdom, where she finds she has shrunk to the size of a cat. Looking around, she is met by a white cat named Yuki, who pleads with Haru to leave the Cat Kingdom at once. However, Natoru appears, and takes both Haru and Muta to the King's palace.Haru is taken to be dressed to meet the King, while Muta is escorted to a banquest hall, where he gorges on a number of foods. As Haru changes, she is then met by the King, who is overjoyed that she has chosen to marry his son. However, Haru explains her trepidations, since she is a human, and the Prince is a cat. The King and Natori smile, telling her that that is no longer a problem, since Haru is now half-cat. Haru looks in a nearby mirror, and is shocked to see that she has somehow turned into a cat! Running from the room, she finds Muta, stuck in a bowl of catnip jelly, unable to move.Even though Haru is still upset over being turned into a cat, she is taken to the main dining room, where the King attempts to cheer her up with a number of entertainment acts. When none seem to please Haru, he has the performers tossed out a nearby window. Suddenly, a masked strange comes forward, promising to cheer up Haru. As the band strikes up a waltz, Haru dances with the mysterious stranger, feeling more at ease being a cat. This feeling causes her to grow whiskers, which makes her gasp. The masked stranger then tells her not to forget who she really is, as he said so before. Suddenly, the Cat King calls for the music to stop, demanding to know who the stranger is. He removes his mask to reveal the Baron! The Cat King sends his troops to take down the Baron and retrieve Haru, but this quickly fails. In the ensuing scuffle, Muta is freed from the bowl of catnip jelly, and joins the battle.Off to one side, Yuki appears and hastens Baron and Haru to her. She explains that there is a way for Haru to regain her human form, and helps her and the Baron escape through a secret entrance, which leads to a maze outside the castle, of which a large tower extends from it's center. Yuki explains that if they can get to the top before a specific time, they will be able to return to their world.Muta then joins them, and they set out going through the maze. However, the King sends a number of troops, and tries to throw them off course. His plans fail, and Haru, Baron and Muta make it to the tower, climbing up it's outer stairway. Just when it seems they've made it halfway-up, the King detonates the tower, causing the mid-point to plummet to the bottom!Haru, Baron and Muta are then met by the King, though the reunion is short-lived when Prince Lune arrives, along with a contingency of soldiers. The King explains to the Prince about Haru, but the Prince explains that he wishes to marry Yuki. He then hands her the same box that Haru saw him with on the street. The box contains some fish crackers. Yuki then explains that they are just like the kind that Haru gave her when she was a kitten, and thanks her for helping her all those years ago.The King finds this very moving, but then tries to see if Haru will marry him instead. Haru angrily rejects his advances, and Muta happily proclaims that he admires her spirit.The King, not one to be spurned, still tries to claim Haru, but Muta and Lune's soldiers prevent him from advancing, and Haru heads up the nearby steps for the top of the tower. Baron also confronts the King, and wins in a duel against him, before hearing Haru cry out from the top of the tower...which leads to the other world, but whose opening is several hundred miles up in the sky! Muta and Baron rush to her aid, but not before she falls over the edge.They freefall towards Haru's hometown, when a flock of crows appears, courtesy of Toto. Haru makes it safely down, and they say their goodbyes, with Haru admitting that she has a bit of a crush on Baron, before he takes off.The next day, Haru's Mother awakes, and is shocked to see that Haru is up before her, having already prepared breakfast. Later on, Haru meets up with Hiromi, who happily tells her friend that the guy she has a crush on has broken up with his girlfriend. However, instead of being excited at this, Haru shows no concern, as this is now unimportant to her. It appears that her experience has allowed her to become more independent.

title: Carnival of Souls
synopsis: While out for a drive, three girlfriends get into a car race with two boys. As the car chase takes them down backroads, they come to a bridge. Trying to get across it, the girls car ends up crashing through the side and the car sinks into the water.Some time afterward, a search party is brought out, but after several hours, there appears to be no sign of the car. However, things take a turn for the surprising, when one of the girls, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), emerges from the water, cold and shaken. Some people ask her questions, but she does not give any answers at that time.Some time afterward, Mary gets a job as an organ player in Utah. Before she leaves, she stops by the organ factory in town, and places on their organ for them. The place she is going to has an organ made from the same factory as well. When the Factory owner requests that Mary come back some time to play for them again, she claims she will not be returning.Mary then takes off on her trip. As she nears Salt Lake City, Utah, her vision is drawn to a dark pavilion lying back a ways towards the horizon. As she glances out the passenger side window, she is shocked to see a man staring in at her! Mary turns away and looks back, but the figure is soon gone. However, Mary is shocked again when the same figure appears on the road in front of her, causing her to drive off the road. Collecting herself, Mary gets back on the road, and heads towards Salt Lake City.Mary rooms at a residence, presided over by a woman named Mrs Thomas (Frances Feist). There is another person rooming at the house, a rather slimy warehouse worker named John Linden (Sidney Berger).After putting her things in her new residence, Mary goes off to the church to meet the Minister (Art Ellison). She practices on the organ, but after some time, stops and sits by a window to contemplate. The Minister asks her if she would like to take a ride with him to an appointment. Mary also makes a request that since the appointment is outside of town, if they could drive by the pavilion she saw on the way in.The Minister agrees, and they drive up to the entrance. The Minister explains that the place is gated off to keep people out. Mary seems curious to go in, but the Minister says he won't, given that there are rules forbidding people to enter.Returning back to the apartment, Mary takes a bath, but is interrupted when John knocks on her door. He offers to buy her dinner, but she refuses. After John has left, Mary walks out and looks over the railing, only to see the man she saw before standing in the 1st floor foyer! As he walks towards the stairs, Mary returns to her room and bolts the door. Sometime afterwards, Mrs Thomas comes up with a sandwich and some coffee. When Mary inquires about the man she saw, Mrs Thomas claims she didn't see anyone on the way upstairs. Mary insists she saw someone, but the landlady claims that Mary's mind must be playing tricks on her.Mary soon after attempts to go to sleep, but her mind finds itself drifting away to the pavilion.Waking up, Mary finds a knock on the door, and John enters offering homemade coffee. As they talk, Mary then explains to John her job as being an organist for a church in town. John thinks that Mary must be a very religious girl, but she explains that she doesn't care either way, and that she plays just so she can get paid. Mary thanks him for the gesture, and then goes out to shop for clothing.Going into a Department Store, she tries on a dress, and then changes back into her own clothes. However, upon exiting the dressing room, Mary is surprised when it seems that the sound of the world has stopped around her, and nobody can hear or see her! Wandering out of the store and into a nearby park, she breathes a sigh of relief when she hears some birds chirping, and the sounds of the world seem to start up again.Going over to a drinking fountain, Mary stops to drink, but upon seeing a black suit in front of her, Mary looks up and panics! Rushing over to a nearby man, she insists that the man by the drinking fountain is the one she's been seeing...but it soon appears she was in error, even though Mary insists it was him.The man she rushed to is a Doctor. Intending to calm her down, he takes her to his office nearby, and listens to everything Mary has to say. The Doctor assumes that the appearance of this apparition to Mary may have something to do with the trauma she experienced after surviving the car crash. When pressing Mary to see if the figure resembles anyone she knows, Mary insists she's never seen the man before. Feeling that the man may have some connection to the abandoned pavilion outside of town, Mary decides to go there, cutting off the Doctor in mid-analysis.Mary soon arrives at the abandoned pavilion, and begins to walk around. Strange things happen here and there, but she soon calms as she walks around.Returning back to the house, she meets up with Joe who again offers to take her out to dinner. Mary claims she already ate, but when Joe offers to pick her up after her organ practice at the church, Mary agrees, claiming she doesn't want to be alone.Mary then goes to the church, but as she plays the organ, something strange comes over her, and she finds herself playing a strange, and eerie melody on the organ. As she plays, a vision comes to her of a group of people inside the pavilion's enormous ballroom area, dancing. Each of them resembles the man with pale skin, and dark areas around their eyes.Suddenly, the Minister's hands press down on Mary's, ending the song. The Minister is shocked at the music that Mary has chosen to play, and orders her to resign from her post. At these words, Mary quietly gathers her things and leaves.Outside, she runs into John, who eagerly takes her to a club. John keeps trying to be sociable to Mary, but she just seems distant and unable to respond, even though she claims she likes being with him.Going back to the house, John attempts to get intimate with Mary, but she does not seem to welcome any of his advances. As she goes over to her dresser with a mirror on it, John walks up behind her, but to Mary, the reflection is that of the eerie man she's seen before! Mary then yells for John to stay away from her, and John leaves, as Mary pleads that she doesn't want to be alone.The next day, the doctor whom Mary had met previously shows up. Inquiring to Mrs Thomas, she explains that Mary was moving furniture in her room around all night, and would not let her in in the morning. The Doctor claims he gave Mary advice, but Mrs Thomas claims to the Doctor that she doesn't want Mary lodging with her any longer. The Doctor then assures the landlady that Mary intends to leave soon.Sometime afterwards, Mary packs her suitcases, and quietly leaves the house, not saying a word to Mrs Thomas when she speaks to her.Mary's car gives her transmission trouble, and she ends up going to a local service station. When the station attendant asks her if she wishes to get out of the car, Mary refuses. She stays in the car as it is lifted into the air on the service station's platform. As a customer pulls in for gas, the attendance leaves Mary alone in the garage.As she waits, she hears the sound of a door open, and heavy footsteps. A hand then turns the release valve for the lift, and the car slowly lowers to the ground. Mary has the doors locked, but as she hears something that makes her back towards the passenger door, it suddenly flies open!Mary runs for her life down the street. As she does so, suddenly she finds that like in the Department Store, she has become invisible to people, as well as the sound of the world cuts off.Rushing into a bus station, she finds tries to buy a ticket, but the attendant will not listen. Suddenly, a loud speaker blares of a bus leaving from gate 9. Mary rushes from the gate and quickly rushes onto the bus...only to be met with the wide-eyes stares of the apparitions she saw dancing in the pavilion's dance hall! They smile and chase her off the bus as Mary runs for her life, calling out and pleading for someone to hear or see her!Mary returns to the park from the day before, and just like the day before, she hears birds chirping and the sounds of the world start back up again. Mary then rushes to the Doctor's office, requesting that he help her,feeling that she is really going crazy. The Doctor's chair has been turned away from her, but as it turns around, she finds the man from before sitting in it! Mary lets out a scream--and wakes from her daydream, still in her car in the garage (though the lift is now down instead of up). Mary quickly throws the car into reverse, and heads out of town, back to the pavilion.Going into the abandoned ball room, she soon finds the same apparitions she has seen in her dream (as well as on the bus). Slowly, they start to dance. Mary watches, and as the music begins to turn eerie and the beat of the organ fills her ears, she cries out and runs off, with the apparitions in pursuit. They chase her all over the pavilion grounds. Mary tries to escape but falls and lies screaming as the dead-eyed figures close around her.Sometime afterward, a search party looking for Mary finds her car at the Pavilion's gates. Searching the grounds, they find her foot prints rushing off into a sandy area, and an imprint on the ground where her body was, but no sign of her.Back in Kansas, the search party has finally recovered the car that fell into the lake. After pulling it out of the water, we see that not only are the other two girls still in the car, but so is Mary's body as well!

title: Blade Runner
synopsis: In 2019, humans have genetically engineered Replicants, which are essentially humans who are designed for labor and entertainment purposes. They are illegal on earth, and if they make it to our planet they are hunted down and killed.Rick Deckard is a blade runner, a hunter of replicants. A group of replicants makes it to Los Angeles seeking a way to extend their life span. Replicants have a built-in 4 year life span, and this group is near the end.==========================================A crawl after the opening credits informs us that, in the near future, technology that has created synthetic humans has entered a new phase: replicants, sophisticated androids that are virtually identical to humans, are now equal in strength and emotion to their creators. Replicants are designed and built by the Tyrell Corporation, a giant multi-conglomerate headquartered in two pyramid-like towers. The latest version of replicant technology is the Nexus 6 model. Replicants are mostly used as manual laborers in the off world colonies out in space. Because of their advanced nature and tendency towards violence, replicants have been outlawed on Earth. Specialized police units, blade runners, are charged with the difficult task of detecting replicants who come to Earth. If found, replicants are executed or retired. An opening title tells us that the setting for the story is Los Angeles, and the date is November, 2019. Los Angeles and the surrounding area have become heavily industrialized, crowded with people and rain falls constantly.At the Tyrell Corporation, a blade runner, Holden (Morgan Paull) is interviewing a new employee using a special device called a Voight-Kampff (VK) analyzer. The machine is designed to detect any physical changes in the test subject in response to questions that are deliberately meant to affect the subject emotionally. After a few questions, the man being tested, Leon, becomes obviously agitated and eventually hostile, shooting Holden. (We learn later that Holden survived: He can breathe okay, as long as nobody unplugs him.)Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former blade runner, is eating at a Japanese noodle bar when another man, Gaff (Edward James Olmos), tells him he's under arrest. Deckard tries to ignore the man but eventually agrees to go with him. Gaff flies Deckard to police headquarters and delivers Deckard to his old boss, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). Bryant tells Deckard that a small group of Nexus-6 replicants have come to Earth illegally. Two of them were killed trying to scale a high-voltage security fence outside the Tyrell Corporation. Four have survived; Bryant shows Deckard their files. The leader is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), the most advanced and intelligent of the group. The others are Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Pris (Darryl Hannah) and Leon (Brion James), the replicant who shot Holden. Deckard is charged with tracking them down. Bryant also tells Deckard that the Nexus-6s are believed to be advanced enough that they may have developed emotions, which might make them harder to detect via VK testing. Subsequently, the scientists designed the Nexus-6s to have only a four year lifespan. Bryant sends Deckard to Tyrell Corp's headquarters to test the VK machine on a Nexus-6.Deckard and Gaff fly to Tyrell headquarters. While Deckard awaits Tyrell, he meets Rachael (Sean Young), a beautiful woman who welcomes him and who acts as Tyrell's personal assistant. Tyrell (Joe Turkel) appears and questions Deckard about the Voight-Kampff test, doubting its processes in detecting replicants among humans. Tyrell offers Rachael as a test subject, saying he wants to see a negative test result on a human before providing a replicant to be tested. Deckard asks Rachael over 100 test questions before the VK machine finally alerts Deckard that Rachael is actually a replicant. Rachael leaves and Tyrell explains that Rachael is a Nexus-6 and one of the most advanced replicants ever designed. She has been designed to possess memories, however, the memories given Rachael have been culled from Tyrell's nieces or other family members. Deckard is surprised to realize that Rachael doesn't know she's a replicant.Deckard's first lead takes him to Leon's apartment. He finds a stack of photographs there, as well as a scale from an animal's hide. Not far away, Roy Batty is waiting on the street for Leon to return from his apartment. Leon appears and tells Roy that there were policemen there and he was unable to retrieve his photographs. Roy is perturbed but takes Leon with him to a shop called Eye World, owned by a Chinese man named Chew, who engineers eyes for replicants for Tyrell. He is confronted in his subzero lab by Roy and Leon, the latter of whom rips open Chew's thermal coat to make it easier for Roy to interrogate him. Roy asks Chew about inception dates, the date marking a replicant's first activation and beginning of their four year lifespan. Chew, quickly freezing to death, desperately tells them that they need to talk to Tyrell about increasing their lifespans. Roy suggests that meeting with Tyrell will be difficult, however, Chew tells him that a Tyrell employee, JF Sebastian, may be able to gain Roy access.Deckard takes Leon's stack of photos home with him. He is surprised by Rachael in the elevator. Deckard, seemingly feeling betrayed, is quite rude to Rachael, who was unable to talk to Tyrell himself after she found out she is a replicant. Though Rachael shows Deckard a picture of herself with her mother, Deckard insensitively quashes Rachael's insistence that she has actual memories, telling her they'd been taken from other people. Rachael leaves, extremely hurt. Later, while drinking, Deckard examines old photographs on his piano and dreams of a white unicorn. When he awakes, he examines one of Leon's photos and finds that Zhora was in a back room. Deckard notes that she has a prominent tattoo on her neck of a looped serpent.In another part of Los Angeles, near an old, neglected hotel called The Bradbury, a woman walks into an alley and covers herself with waste paper to keep warm. She dozes for a bit until a man approaches her and startles her awake. She runs away, breaking the window of his van, but the man kindly returns one of her bags and she becomes friendly. The woman is revealed to be Pris, one of the Nexus-6s Deckard is pursuing. The man is JF Sebastian (William Sanderson), a genetic designer for the Tyrell Corporation and the person Chew told Roy to find. Pris agrees to stay at Sebastian's place where he designs lifelike toys and dolls.Deckard visits the crowded streets near Chinatown and has a old Asian woman examine the animal scale. Deckard believes it to be from a fish but it's from a snake and, like most animals of the time period, is artificial. The maker's serial number is also visible under the microscan, a man named Abdul Ben Hassan, whose shop is right up the street. Deckard confronts Hassan, who tells him he'd made a snake for a dancer working at a club owned by Taffy Lewis. Deckard goes to the club and places a quick call to Rachael, apologizing for his insensitivity and asking her if she'd like to join him at the club. Rachel refuses.Deckard finds that Zhora is an exotic dancer at the club who uses artificial snakes in her performances. Deckard poses as an irritating private eye investigating abuses by club owners who may spy on female performers. Zhora sees through Deckard's ruse and beats him violently and dashes from the club into the streets. Deckard quickly catches up and chases her until he's able to shoot her. Zhora crashes through several plate glass windows and falls to the street, dead. When a passerby examines Zhora, they see the snake tattoo under her ear.Bryant arrives on the scene and talks to Deckard, congratulating him for finding and retiring Zhora. He tells Deckard that there are four more replicants to retire; Deckard insists that there are only three left. Bryant tells him that Rachael has disappeared and Deckard now has to find her. Deckard spots her a few moments later across the street. As he follows her, he's suddenly grabbed by Leon, who beats him severely. As Leon appears poised to kill Deckard by stabbing his fingers through Deckard's eyes, his forehead explodes; he has been shot by Rachael using Deckard's own pistol, which Leon had batted from Deckard's hand a few moments before. Deckard returns to his apartment and Rachael joins him. Deckard appears to be much more sympathetic toward Rachael since she saved him from Leon. When she asks him if he'd hunt and retire her, he tells her he wouldn't, but someone else surely would. He gives her a drink and the two play together on Deckard's piano. Deckard becomes more amorous and Rachael rejects his advances. Deckard prevents her from leaving his apartment and the two have sex off screen.Pris wakes up in Sebastian's apartment. She talks to him about his strange skin condition, Methuselah Syndrome, which makes him age quickly -- he is only 25, but looks older. Suddenly, Roy appears (likely summoned there by Pris). He sadly shares the news that Zhora and Leon are both retired. Roy and Pris both reveal to Sebastian that they are Nexus-6s and they need to get help for Pris or she'll die. Pris proves to Sebastian that she's artificial by grabbing an egg from boiling water and tossing it to Sebastian, who finds it too hot to handle. Roy notices that Sebastian plays chess and asks him about his opponent, who is Tyrell himself. Roy convinces Sebastian to use his connection to Tyrell to arrange a personal meeting. Sebastian reluctantly agrees.Roy and Sebastian go to Tyrell's pyramidal home and take an elevator to his penthouse. They are stopped as a security measure but are allowed to proceed when Sebastian voices two moves to Tyrell himself that win the chess match they'd been playing; the last move is given to him by Roy. In Tyrell's bedchamber, Roy confronts his creator, saying specifically he wants an extension of his short lifespan and calls Tyrell father. (In the 1982 Theatrical and 1992 Director's editions, Roy says fucker in place of father.) Tyrell explains, with technical details, that artificial beings like Roy have been permanently designed not to live longer than their lifespan and that no known biological process has yet been able to change that. Roy becomes more despondent, telling Tyrell he's done questionable things. Tyrell patronizes him, saying he's also accomplished great things. Roy, still despondent, first kisses Tyrell, then begins to crush his skull, poking his thumbs through his creator's eyes. Tyrell falls dead and a horrified Sebastian, unable to escape, is killed off screen by Roy.Deckard flies in his car to the sector where JF Sebastian lives. He receives a report from Bryant who tells him that Tyrell is dead and Sebastian has also been found dead at the same scene. Deckard places a call to Sebastian's apartment claiming to be a friend. Pris answers the call but hangs up without a word. Deckard has to move his car when some street people climb on the back, apparently hoping to scavenge parts they can sell. Deckard enters Sebastian's apartment and searches for evidence or leads. The apartment is full of lifelike toys and mannequins. As Deckard searches the mess, he is surprised by a disguised Pris, who assaults him using acrobatics. As she performs a series of back flips to finish Deckard off, he shoots her through the abdomen. She twitches violently for a few moments before Deckard shoots her twice more and finally kills her.Roy finds Pris dead, and he kisses her lifeless lips. Deckard shoots at him, and Roy accuses him of not being very sporting to shoot an unarmed man. Roy stalks Deckard, seizing Deckard's hand through a wall and deliberately dislocating and breaking two of his fingers in memory of Zhora and Pris. Deckard escapes to an upper floor in the building but is easily found by Roy, as he howls from the pain of trying to reset one of his fingers. Deckard keeps moving, but is in great pain and drops his gun. Roy is already showing signs of his own impending death - he stabs himself through the hand with a large nail to temporarily stabilize his condition. Deckard seizes an opportunity to beat Roy with a large pipe but he cannot incapacitate Roy, whose superhuman strength is too much for Deckard. Deckard eventually escapes to a window ledge. Deckard climbs to the roof, but Roy appears moments later. Deckard tries to jump to another roof across the street. He nearly plummets, hanging on by one hand. Roy makes the jump quite easily and peers over the ledge at Deckard, saying Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. Deckard slips and Roy catches his arm with one hand, dragging him to safety. Roy sits down near him, holding a dove he found on the other roof, and tells Deckard that he's seen more in his short life than most humans would see in a full lifetime. Roy is saddened by the idea that all the memories he's acquired will be lost like tears in rain. Then, echoing the last thing Leon said to Deckard, Roy says time to die -- but he's referring to himself. As he finally dies, the dove in his hand flies off. In the original theatrical version (1982) the rain has stopped and the dove flies toward a clear blue sky. In the Final Cut (2007) the rain continues and the dove flies toward an overcast sky. In a Deckard notes that the replicants only want the same things that humans do.Gaff meets Deckard on the roof and throws his pistol back to him. He congratulates Deckard on completing his investigation; Deckard tells him he's officially finished with hunting replicants. As Gaff walks away, he looks back over his shoulder, and yells, It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?, referring to Rachael.Deckard returns to his apartment and is alarmed to find the door ajar. He takes out his gun, and calls Rachael. When she doesn't answer he walks through the rooms with his gun drawn. In the bedroom, Rachael is completely covered by the sheet. He fears that she is dead. Much to his relief, she wakes up when he pulls the sheet back and touches her. He asks her whether she loves and trusts him; she replies that she does. A few minutes later, she is dressed and Deckard, after checking the lobby outside his apartment, motions for her to join him in the elevator. On the floor of the lobby is a small origami unicorn, left there by Gaff. Deckard studies it, and Gaff's words about Rachael not living echo in his head. He realizes that Gaff was there but let Rachael live. Deckard studies the unicorn for a moment, then crushes it in his hand. In the Final Cut and Director's (1992) editions, the film ends when the elevator doors close. In the Theatrical edition, Deckard and Rachael drive into a mountainous area and Deckard explains in voice-over that Tyrell told him that Rachael has no termination date. Echoing Gaff's sentiment atop the roof, he muses, I didn't know how long we had together... who does?

title: High Plains Drifter
synopsis: A distant figure on horseback rides through shimmering, midday heat. He's nearer now, a bearded man in a dark cowboy hat and long dusty overcoat--the Stranger (Clint Eastwood).The Stranger enters the tiny western town of Lago and rides slowly down the main street. The townspeople stop and watch him pass. Freighter Jake Ross (John Quade) cracks a bullwhip to wake his team of horses. The Stranger, startled, snaps his head around at the source before riding on.The Stranger leaves his horse at the livery stable and walks to the saloon. On the front porch three armed, tough-looking men watch him enter: Bill Borders (Scott Walker), Tommy Morris (James Gosa), and Fred Short (Russ McCubbin). The Stranger exchanges looks with Borders and enters the saloon.From the end of the bar farthest from some locals, he orders a beer and a bottle from saloon keeper Lutie Naylor (Paul Brinegar). The three men who were on the porch enter and take positions around him. Borders says, Flea-bitten range bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here's a little too quick for 'em. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us, huh? Everyone freezes, waiting for the Stranger's reaction. He suddenly reaches for the whiskey bottle, scattering the local town folk, and causing the three tough men to tense. As he leaves, he whispers, I'm faster than you'll ever live to be,He walks across the street to the barber shop, whiskey bottle in hand, and pays for a shave and a hot bath. He hangs his overcoat and gun belt on a coat rack. The barber (William O'Connell) seats him, drapes him with a smock, and nervously applies shaving cream to his face. The three toughs enter and resume taunting him. The Stranger ignores them, irritating Borders, who suddenly spins the chair. The Stranger shoots Borders in the forehead with a gun hidden under the smock. He then shoots Morris and Short before they can react.He stands and removes the shaving cream with the smock. He puts on his gun belt, replacing a wooden gun stock in the holster with his smoking gun. He steps outside, where the stunned townspeople are creeping over to view the carnage. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), gives him a cigar and offers a light, asking, What did you say your name was, again? The Stranger replies, I didn't.The Stranger walks toward the stable. Callie Travers (Mariana Hill), a young woman of unknown background, purposefully collides with him. The shoulder of her sleeve is ripped, and she berates him for it. He tells her there's no reason to make a fuss, that she could have asked if she wanted to get acquainted. She angrily insults and repeatedly provokes him. He tries to leave, but she grabs him and insults him again. He returns her insults. She tells him he has the manners of a goat and slaps the cigar from his mouth. Pushed too far, he tells her, You're the one that could use a lesson in manners, and drags her, screaming, into the stable. He throws her onto the loose hay and rapes her.The Stranger walks back past the barber shop where townsmen remove the dead bodies left by the stranger and clean up the barbers shop. They stop and watch him pass. He enters Belding's Hotel and finds the owner, Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley), at the desk. The Stranger says, Room. Belding gives him a key, reminding him to sign the register. The stranger merely looks at him and goes upstairs to his room. In the room, he wedges a chair under the doorknob, takes a gulp of whiskey, and lays down to sleep.In a dream, a bloodied man (Buddy Van Horn) lays in the same position as the sleeping Stranger. The man who is wearing a badge is being whipped in the street by three men. It is dark, but the silhouettes of those watching are clearly the townspeople. The three men whipping him are not shown. The bloody man asks the townspeople for help, but receives none. As he passes out, he says, Damn you all to hell. The stranger wakes from the dream.The next morning, the Stranger wakes and goes to the barber shop. He asks for his bath which the barber, instantly nervous, orders Mordecai to prepare in the back room. The trembling barber nicks the man he is shaving, Sheriff Sam Shaw (Walter Barnes), shoos him away. Sam waits until the Stranger has settled into his bath, then asks if he can sit down to talk. Trapped, the Stranger reluctantly gestures that Sam may join him. Sam says that Borders was not a loved man and there will be no charges filed.Callie Travers, who The Stranger had raped in the stable, enters the tub room with a revolver, says You dirty bastard!, and shoots at the Stranger, who slides under the water. Sam wrestles her for the gun and, as he drags her out, instructs Mordecai to tell the Stranger not to leave town until Sam talks to him. After they're gone, the Stranger comes up for air and says, I wonder why it took her so long to get mad. Mordecai, who witnessed the rape, responds, Because maybe you didn't go back for more.In a backroom of the mining office, the prominent men in town are meeting: Mayor Hobart (Stefan Gierasch) of the general store, Dave Drake (Mitchell Ryan) and Morgan Allen (Jack Ging) of the mining company, the undertaker (Richard Bull), the gunsmith (Reed Cruikshanks), hotelier Belding, saloonkeeper Naylor, freighter Ross, and the preacher (Robert Donner). They have learned that Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin brothers, are to be released from prison that day. These three have sworn to burn the town to the ground. The group was counting on the mining company's hired gunfighters--Borders, Morris, and Short--to defend the town, but The Stranger killed them. Now, they are considering hiring the Stranger. Belding and the preacher don't like it, but the rest are in favor.The meeting is interrupted by Sam entering with still angry Callie in tow. Sam tells them about Callie's shooting outburst. Morgan Allen, her lover, tells her to be patient. Callie says, Isn't forcible rape in broad daylight a misdemeanor in this town? Allen tells her they need to avoid hysterics. She refers to hysterics not too long ago and spits on him, loudly questioning the manhood of the townsmen.Sam finds the Stranger eating at the hotel and tries to persuade him to defend the town. He says Bridges and the Carlins were troubleshooters for the mining company who were bullying townspeople before being convicted of stealing gold from the mining office. The Stranger suggests they were railroaded, and Sam admits that's why they are mad at the town. The Stranger says Sam can handle it. Sam replies, I'm no law man, adding that his predecessor, Marshal Jim Duncan, was whipped to death in the street by outsiders. More pleading, then Sam says, This is a God-fearing town. These are God-fearing people. The Stranger replies, You like 'em. You save 'em. Desperate, Sam says, Look, what if we offered you anything you want? The Stranger stops in his tracks, turns, and asks, Anything?In Hobart's store, the mayor and Sam explain that the Stranger has a free hand in this town, that he can have anything he wants in the town, even if it's a squaw or a Mex to keep your bed warm at night, and that, as far as preparing the ambush, everyone is ready to follow his orders. The Stranger pockets a handful of cigars. He gives two Indian children each a jar of candy and gives a stack of blankets to an old Indian man Hobart has just scolded for touching the merchandise. On the way out, he encounters Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom), Lewis's wife, who served his meal earlier and caught his eye. He repeats, Anything I want.The Stranger visits the boot maker (John Hillerman) and takes many items, for which Sam says there is no charge. He does the same at the leather maker (Jack Kosslyn's) shop. A number of townsmen follow him, carrying his booty. He leads them to the saloon where he orders a round on the house for everyone who's following him. When Naylor complains, Sam delights in saying Everyone's got to put something in the kitty. Hearing this, The Stranger removes Sam's badge and pins it on Mordecai. Mayor Hobart snickers. The Stranger removes Hobart's hat and puts it on Mordecai's head, making him both sheriff and mayor. Mordecai is thrilled.At the gunsmith shop, Mordecai selects a huge revolver since he can't be sheriff without a gun. The Stranger informs the townsmen they are now part of the City of Lago Volunteers, tells the gunsmith to give each man a rifle, and orders everyone to report to the street for drills.At the territorial prison, Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis), Dan Carlin (Dan Vadis), and Cole Carlin (Anthony James) are released, and their gun belts returned. The jailer claims their horses were used for food, so they face a long walk. Dan says, Drake and Allen don't seem to have remembered. Stacey replies, One way or another, they'll remember.In Lago, the volunteer townsmen take shooting positions on the roofs of the taller buildings, while the Stranger watches from a central walkway. Sam and Mordecai gallop through town on Ross's wagon, pulling a trailer loaded with three stuffed dummies on saw horses. The townsmen rain gunfire on the dummies, but score no hits. The Stranger mutters, Shit.Ross approaches the Stranger from behind, holding a knife, and says, I don't remember lending my wagons to be shot up. Without looking back, the Stranger says, You're gonna look pretty silly with that knife sticking up your ass. He draws and fires four shots, beheading each dummy and knocking off Mordecai's hat. He holsters his gun and says, You still here? Ross replies, No, I was just going. Sam and Mordecai are excited about the shooting display, Sam saying, This is going to be a picnic. The Stranger tells them to keep the men practicing.The Stranger asks two Mexican laborers to use lumber from Belding's barn to build picnic tables. When Naylor, who overheard, questions the picnic, he's told he is furnishing the beer and whiskey. Belding arrives. The Stranger overrules his objection to his barn being torn down, and tells him to provide 35 bedsheets for the picnic. Mordecai, the Stranger's new sidekick, says they also need someone to provide a barbecued steer and 200 gallons of red paint. Finally, the Stranger orders Belding to get everyone out of his hotel. Flabbergasted, Belding asks where his live-ins are supposed to go. The Stranger replies, Out.Bridges and the Carlins come across three men camping. They shoot them and steal their horses and clothes. Now, instead of walking, they are riding at full gallop.At the mining office, Allen and Belding suggest to Drake that hiring the Stranger was a mistake. They argue that convicts always threaten revenge but rarely carry through, and complain that the Stranger's crazy orders have the townspeople turning on one another. Drake wants to wait a few days to be sure. The discussion is heated, and reveals that the townspeople, in addition to Bridges and the Carlins, had a hand in Marshal Duncan's death, or as Drake puts it, One hang, we all hang. Drake refuses to budge and Allen storms out.At the hotel, the evicted guests are leaving, and Belding and the preacher are outraged. The preacher complains to the Stranger but gets nowhere. Sarah reports the readiness of the Stranger's connecting rooms, The best in the hotel. One for entertaining and one for sleeping...if your conscience lets you sleep. The Stranger replies, I sleep just fine, Ma'am. Care to see for yourself? Sarah leaves in a huff. The Stranger tells Belding he wants fried chicken for dinner with the best bottle of wine in town, then leaves. Mordecai giggles and, when the angry Belding swipes at him, dives under the raised walkway.Under the walkway, Mordecai has a flashback to the night of Marshal Duncan's whipping which he viewed from this same position. The whippers are Bridges and the Carlins. As in the Stranger's dream, the townspeople just watch. The exception is Sarah, who tries to stop it, but is restrained by Lewis.In Callie's bedroom, the Stranger enters while Callie is brushing her hair. She gets a gun from the dresser, but he grabs her wrist and controls it. He tells her he wants her company at dinner. She calls him an animal and says she doesn't eat with dogs. He says, You might if it's the dog that runs the pack. She lets him kiss her and take the gun. She says she needs half an hour to get ready. He returns the gun and leaves.At the hotel, Sarah is serving Callie and the Stranger dinner. She asks, Do you have any special request for dessert? The Stranger looks at Callie and says, No, I've already taken care of that. Callie smiles. Sarah leaves, disgusted.In the hills, Cole's horse has come up lame, and he suggests they're pushing too hard. This angers Stacey, who says maybe they should leave Cole. Dan tries to calm Stacey, saying Cole can ride double with him. Stacey says, When they find those bodies back there, they'll be a hunting party out for us, and I want time to take one year of my life out of Lago before we move on. They shoot the lame horse and ride on, slower now.Allen and Ross meet Mordecai walking at night. He's been drinking. Allen knocks him cold with a left hook. They look up and watch the light go out in the Stranger's hotel room.In the church, Belding speaks to the church-goers, including Drake. He complains that good people have been thrown out of his hotel, which is now being used for fornication and sins of the flesh. He and Sam argue over who should step in. It gets caustic, and the preacher says, Gentlemen, please! Look what's happening to us. Belding agrees, adding It couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago.In his hotel room, the Stranger sleeps while Callie sneaks out of bed and gets dressed. Outside, Morgan Allen, Jake Ross, and three henchmen carefully ascend the hotel stairs, which creak anyway. Callie leaves the room and shuts the door, just as the men arrive. The men enter the room and beat the covered figure in bed with axe handles. The Stranger, on a ledge outside the window, lights a stick of dynamite and throws it onto the bed. The attackers see it and rush for the door, but only three escape before the room explodes.Outside, the Stranger shoots two attackers as they retreat down the stairs, leaving only Allen, who ducks into the hotel lobby. The Stranger follows and finds Allen holding Sarah in front of him as a shield. As Allen backs away, the Stranger shoots his exposed shoulder. Allen falls backward to the floor, pulling Sarah down with him. Bleeding badly, he releases Sarah, and scrambles out the back door toward the barn.In the barn, Allen mounts a horse and rides out. Callie pleads with him to take her with him, but he brushes her off and rides on. The Stranger has an easy shot at Callie, but lowers his gun, and she runs away into the darkness.The townspeople arrive, having heard the blast. Upset at the damage to his hotel, Belding lets it slip that he knew about the attack. The Stranger hears and is unhappy. He orders the townsmen to begin digging graves, in the dark, for the four men killed. Drake assures the Stranger he had nothing to do with the attack and offers him a bonus to stick with the agreement. The Stranger doubles it, Drake agrees, and the Stranger turns and steps away. Belding whispers to Drake, questioning the large bonus. Drake whispers back, Promising's one thing, paying's another. He might just catch a bullet. The Stranger says, Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels too.The Stranger turns to Sarah, who says I don't know where you're going to sleep now. All the rooms are ruined, except for our room. The Stranger looks at her and smirks. Sarah backs away, shaking her head. The Stranger takes her elbow and leads her into the hotel. She calls to Lewis for help. Lewis hears, but does not respond.In the Belding's bedroom, Sarah grabs a pair of shears and backs into a corner. The Stranger lays on the bed, and asks what she is doing. She says she's defending herself, citing Callie's rape. The Stranger plays with her, recalling Callie enjoyed it, and acting as if Sarah wants the same. He says, I'd like to oblige you, but a man's got to get his rest sometime. Sarah, angry at the suggestion, attacks him. He controls her, and forces her to kiss. She stops fighting and submits.The next morning, they are relaxed with each other, Sarah in bed and the Stranger getting dressed. Sarah asks if he has heard of Jim Duncan, who lies in an unmarked grave, adding, They say the dead don't rest without a marker. As he's leaving, she says, Be careful. You're a man who makes people afraid and that's dangerous. He replies, It's what people know about themselves, inside, that make them afraid.At the cemetery, the townsmen are finishing up the four graves. The Stranger is painting something unseen on a sign. At the Strangers behest, Mordecai orders everyone to begin painting the town red. There is grumbling and disbelief, but no dissent. Naylor says, I'll paint if you say we got to, but when we get done this place is gonna look like Hell. As the tired men tote their tools back to town, the sign is revealed. Hell, in red, covers Lago.Lewis enters the Belding bedroom and tells Sarah there is an important meeting they should attend. She refuses, saying the neighbors make her sick. While defending the neighbors, Lewis reveals that Duncan was killed because he had discovered the mine was on government property and was determined to report it. The mine would be closed, ruining the town. He sees the murder as the price of progress, but Sarah can't live with that anymore. She says, I'm packing to leave, Lewis. I won't be coming back.In the hills outside town, Bridges and the Carlins see Allen, near collapse, fall from his horse. Bridges sits him up and tries to persuade him to reveal the combination to the safe in the mining office. He promises that, in return, he'll move Allen into the shade and give him water. Allen curses him. Bridges threatens with a pointed stick, but Allen remains defiant. Bridges drives the stick into his neck, and says Two sticks of dynamite will take care of that iron box. We don't need him.A rifle shot ricochets near Dan's feet, and the three dive behind barely adequate cover. Unbeknownst to them, it's the Stranger, who had been tracking Allen by his blood droplets. Hidden on a ridge above, the Stranger lights a stick of dynamite, leaves it, and changes position. The dynamite explodes while Stacey is firing blindly up the hill, confusing the three, and showering them with debris. Then, from another direction, the Stranger shoots Cole's ear, and the three must hurriedly shift positions. Stacey figures it must be Drake and shouts out, seeking a parley. Getting no response, he fires more shots blindly, and there is another explosion, much closer this time. The three are shook up, filthy, and scratched from the blast. As they listen to the Stranger ride away, still unseen, Stacey screams, I'll kill every man in Lago.The Stranger rides back to Lago which is now completely red. He tells Mordecai, The guests are on their way to the party. Mordecai runs down the street, lined with picnic tables, telling everyone to get ready. He finds the prominent men drinking in the saloon. They are scared and all need one more drink before reluctantly moving outside. The Stranger ties up at the hotel, and on his way in, tells the livery boy to get up in the church tower and ring the bell at the first sign of dust.Bridges and the Carlins ride toward the town, down out of the hills now.The Stranger exits the hotel, having retrieved his overcoat. He walks to the saloon and gets a drink. Sam and Naylor are anxious, wanting him to get ready outside, but he tells them there's plenty of time. Mordecai asks What about after we do it? What do we do then? The Stranger says, Then you live with it.They walk into the street and watch everyone take their positions. A Welcome Home Boys banner has been raised at the town's entrance. Mordecai asks, When are you going to give the signal? The Stranger replies, I'm not. You are. The church bell begins ringing. The Stranger mounts his horse and rides calmly down the back road out of town. The townspeople watch in horror.Bridges and the Carlins arrive, pausing when they see the banner. They draw their guns and gallop down the main street, whooping, shooting, and roping tables. Mordecai yells, Fire!, but they all freeze or panic. Sam is roped and dragged over a collapsing table. Several rooftop gunners are shot or knocked back by splintering wood. The livery boy is shot out of the tower. Stacey catches Drake sneaking out of the mining office, backs him into the lake, and shoots him dead.Later, after dark, the town is ablaze. The battered townspeople are in the saloon being roughed up by Stacey and Dan. Stacey beats Sam back onto a table, yelling, A party? Cole enters with Callie and throws her to the floor. She tries to convince Stacey she always loved him, but he's not buying it. Cole wants to know who ambushed them, and Stacey says, We're going to find out right now. Then, a whip flies in over the swinging doors, wraps around Cole's neck, and drags him out, choking. The Stranger whips Cole to death in the street while Stacey, Dan, and the townspeople remain inside, stupefied by what they hear. Finally, the bloody whip is thrown into the saloon.Stacey orders everyone out into the street where they gather around Cole's body. Stacey and Dan look for the whipper but see no one. Two sticks with lit fuses fly from behind a building and land near the body. The townspeople scatter, screaming Dynamite! When the fuses burn out, Stacey examines them and sees they are just sticks of wood. Dan tells Stacey the horses are gone. Stacey and Dan move down opposite sides of the street, guns drawn, searching for the whipper. A whip from above wraps around Dan's neck, lifts him, and hangs him dead from a balcony.While Stacey is looking at Dan's body, a lantern is thrown into the street. Spooked, Stacey fires three times. While Stacey reloads, the Stranger's voice is heard whispering, Help me, help me. The Stranger steps out in front of a burning building behind Stacey, who turns and sees only his silhouette. Stacey takes aim, but the Stranger draws and shoots Stacey's gun from his hand. Stacey yells, Who are you?, and the Stranger shoots him dead.Belding steps out from between buildings and aims a shotgun at the Stranger's back. A shot is fired and Belding falls over dead. Mordecai is revealed, holding his huge revolver. The Stranger nods and walks away.The next morning, the Stranger rides down the smoldering street. Sarah, well dressed, is climbing aboard a buckboard. She and the Stranger exchange nods. The Stranger rides out to the cemetery where Mordecai is carving a grave marker. Mordecai says, I never did know your name. The Stranger replies, Yes, you do. Take care. As Mordecai watches him ride away, the marker is revealed-- Marshall Jim Duncan, Rest In Peace.In the distance, the Stranger disappears into the heat shimmer.

title: Time Bandits
synopsis: In early 1980s England we find Kevin Lotterby (Craig Warnock), an average 11-year-old boy who is fascinated by history and its legends. However, his material-obsessed parents (David Daker and Sheila Fearn) could care less and spend their evenings ignoring their son and watching game show programs on TV.One night, Kevin is made to get to bed early and just as he lies down to sleep an armored knight riding on horseback bursts from his wardrobe. He then finds himself smack dab in the middle of a forest clearing. Just after Kevin gets to his feet, the forest falls away and his bedroom has turned back to normal, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Examining a picture on his wall almost identical to the scene he just witnessed--a knight on horseback in the middle of a forest--it's his father who bursts in through his door this time, complaining about all of the racket Kevin was making and yells at him to get to sleep.The following evening, Kevin returns to bed equipped with a Polaroid camera and a flashlight, determined to document whatever else might decide to emerge from his wardrobe. Just as he's given up hope and begins to fall asleep, a group of six strangely dressed dwarfs file out of his closet. Kevin shines his light at them and they cower, calling him the The Supreme Being. Soon after discovering his true identity, they gang up on the innocent Kevin, accusing him of things he has no knowledge of. While interrogating him they push him against his picture-decorated wall and find that it moves. Babbling that they've found it they push further on the wall, which reveals a tunnel.Suddenly, a frightening head-shaped apparition appears in Kevin's room and demands that they return what they've stolen from him and that it will bring them great danger. The dwarves continue to push Kevin's picture-filled wall. The face follows them. Kevin runs and helps the dwarves. The wall soon gives way through an opening at the end of the hall and the group plummet into the black space beyond.On a seemingly normal countryside, the dwarves and Kevin suddenly fall from a hole in the sky. As it turns out, they have used a portal to travel back to Italy of 1796, during the Second Battle of Castiglione. They sneak into a fortress where they find a wrecked theatre and Napoleon Bonaparte, watching local actors perform follies for him. Napoleon laughs at a Punch and Judy show until the puppeteer is shot and dies. Dismissing the rest of the acts, he's suddenly thrilled when the dwarves appear onstage and begin to perform a soft-shoe number to Me and My Shadow, a song that won't be written for another 130 years. Napoleon is pleased to see people shorter than himself performing and invites them to dinner, proclaiming them his new generals. The dwarves wait until Napoleon passes out from drinking wine and proceed to rob him of everything his forces had plundered and carry it out in a large tapestry. As they make their escape, one of the real generals discovers their plot and chases them. The dwarves find another portal and are able to escape.They subsequently arrive in the Middle Ages. They end up plummeting through the roof of a carriage, upsetting a betrothed couple, Vincent and Pansy (Michael Palin and Shelly Duval), who run off into the forest. The six dwarfs finally explain to Kevin that they worked for The Supreme Being, the creator of the Universe, as designers, creating all the flora and fauna of the world. Kevin learns that the dwarfs, whom are named Randall (David Rappaport)-the self-proclaimed leader, Fidgit (Kenny Baker), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds), Wally (Jack Purvis), and Vermin (Tiny Ross). After designing a particularly foul-smelling tree, the dwarfs were demoted to the job of repairing portals in the space-time fabric. Spurned they spitefully stole the map of the holes' locations, which they are now using to travel around, stealing treasures from across history and get stinkin' rich. As they count up their loot, Kevin suggest they all pose for a group picture with their map. They suddenly hear the cries of the couple they'd landed on and find that they're being robbed by a motley band of thieves. They follow the thieves, landing themselves in snare traps. After convincing the thugs they're criminals, they're taken to Robin Hood (John Cleese), who looks upon their haul from Napoleon as wealth he can redistribute to the local poor. As Hood hands out the loot, the dwarves leave in disgust, angry that their haul has been repossessed.Meanwhile, in secret, this journey is being observed via mystical powers by a malevolent sorcerer, known simply as the Evil Genius or Ultimate Evil (David Warner), who seeks the map for himself to recreate the universe to his liking. In the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, the Evil Genius rants a little about The Supreme Being, saying that slugs are a demonstration of his incompetence. What about you? one of his henchman asks. He created you. Evil responds by blowing him up, adding Don't ever ask me another question like that! No one created me! I am absolute evil! I made myself! Another henchman pushes his luck, asking, Then how does he keep you here? How does he keep you trapped in the fortress? He promptly gets blown up. Good question, Evil states. If I were creating the world I wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils. I would have started with lasers, eight o'clock, Day One!While the dwarfs ponder their next move, Ultimate Evil decides to magically speak through the mouth of one of the more dunderheaded dwarfs in order to convince the rest of them to pursue the resting place of the most fabulous object in the world. The dwarfs begin to fight amongst themselves for the map until the Supreme Being re-materializes, which leads Kevin to jump through a time-travel portal on his own in escape.Kevin unintentionally aides King Agamemnon (Sean Connery) when he falls from a time portal in the sky. After inadvertently helping Agamemnon slay a vicious minotaur, Kevin is welcomed to Agamemnon's royal court and treated like a son. Reflecting on his own neglected life and family, Kevin wishes he can stay with the king forever. Kevin is elated with his new home, capturing scenes during his stay with his Polaroid camera, but this is not to last. A few days later, during a birthday party for Agamemnon, the six dwarfs suddenly appear again and in yet another time-traveling robbery scheme, they manage to steal Agamemnon's riches along with the boy before fleeing through another time portal door.After time-traveling to the infamous luxury liner Titanic, Randall tells Kevin that he'd studied the map more closely & found that Og was right: the Time of Legends is the location of the Most Fabulous Object in the World. However, the boat begins to sink and the stranded group is forced to search out the most fabulous object in the world which turns out to be the Fortress of Ultimate Evil.The Evil Genius, meanwhile, begins to manipulate the adventure with his magical influence, so that Kevin and the dwarfs end up transported out of the freezing waters of the Atlantic Ocean to the ocean of the Time of Legends. Here, circumstances become even more fantastical. The group is picked up by a ship containing the Oger Winston (Peter Vaughan) and his human wife (Katherine Helmond). After overpowering Winston and throwing him and his wife overboard, the group takes command of the ship, but they barely escape when their ship is adorning the head of a giant. After putting the giant to sleep by injecting the top of his head with sleep potion, the travelers escape and find themselves in a vast desert.The dwarfs believe an epic treasure, The Most Fabulous Object in the World, awaits in this time-period within the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, where Evil himself resides. Meeting an invisible wall in the middle of the desert, the dwarfs begin to fight and dissent from Randall's authority, when they accidentally down the wall by smashing through it like a pane of glass. They step through the jagged opening to behold Evil's fortress lying ominous on the other side. Once inside, the dwarfs are immediately deceived by Evil's shape-shifting abilities into handing over the map. Evil imprisons them and Kevin in one of many cages hanging over a bottomless void, but the group undoes the lock and swings from cage to cage until they are back within the fortress hall. They are able to use a photograph of the map Kevin had taken earlier to identify holes they can use to recruit help and recover the map. The dwarfs begin putting their plan into action. Randall and four of the dwarfs split up while Kevin stays behind to try to lure away several of the Evil Genius' demon minions that chase him.Kevin is almost left to face the Evil Genius alone when suddenly all kinds of characters from all time periods come to the rescue, among the group several Roman archers, cowboys, a battle tank, knights, and a futuristic soldier, and the dwarfs.The cowboys attempt to wrangle Evil with their lassos, but he begins to spin and the centrifugal force sends them flying. Evil's skull opens up and a wicked looking pole extends from it, producing a knife which cuts the ropes which unsuccessfully bound him. When the archers attempt to skewer them with their well-aimed arrows, Evil essentially turns himself into a pincushion and fires the arrows right back at their sources.Although the hodge-podge group puts up what could be considered a good effort, all efforts to foil evildoing prove in vain and all certainly seems lost. But then, out of nowhere, The Supreme Being appears in human form (Ralph Richardson) and turns Evil into brittle stone. While Randall tries to apologize to The Supreme Being for his groups actions, The Supreme Being reveals that everything which had occurred was actually all part of his plan.The Supreme Being (nicknamed 'SB' by the dwarfs) goes on to briefly explain that he let the midgets borrow the map because, as it turns out, Evil was HIS creation after all and the Supreme Being simply wanted to see it put to the test. Free will is the reason why evil still exists, he explains. He instructs them to dispose of Evil's crumbling bits and pieces into a English Post Box he has provided in order to rid the world of it and warns them not to touch it with their bare hands. Unbeknownst to them, one chunk is overlooked and slowly begins to fester. The SB forgives the dwarfs for their insolence, deciding demotion and a pay cut will suffice as a good enough punishment and announces that it is time to go (presumably back to Heaven). With the time map safely in hand, SB and the dwarfs then leave an indignant Kevin behind to carry on the fight. Soon, however, the festering piece of Evil begins to smolder and in moments Kevin is enveloped in a cloud of thick, strangely yellow-colored smoke.Almost instantaneously, Kevin wakes up to find himself back in his bed, surrounded now by thick, black smoke. Two firemen burst through his door just in time and rush him from his burning home. Outside, his parents fight over which kitchen appliances should have been saved from the flames and seem to have no concern for whether Kevin had made it out of the house alive or not. It is now morning as Kevin watches the growing flames lick at his home as firemen hose it down and begin to get the fires under control. One of the two firemen who saved him walks by and asks if he is all right, and then says You're a very lucky boy. On second look, Kevin recognizes the fireman as the spitting image of King Agamemnon. Baffled, wondering if it was all a dream, Kevin checks his pockets for any evidence of his journey and is amazed to find all of the Polaroid snapshots that he took while on his adventures, thus confirming that it wasn't a dream after all.But before Kevin can show the photos and proof of his time traveling adventures to his bickering parents, another fireman emerges from the home with a charred toaster oven in hand, declaring that it was the cause of the fire, which was left on overnight. His parents open the appliance, revealing the smoking chunk of evil rock lying inside. Kevin gasps, realizing it was the source of the fire. Mum, Dad! He warns, It's Evil! Don't touch it! But as always, his stupid parents foolishly ignore him and touch it anyway to remove it. They both explode on contact with the black rock, leaving almost no trace behind. When Kevin turns around looking for help, he sees King Agamemnon-turned-fireman winking at him who then drives away in his fire truck along with the rest of the firemen now that the fire is put out. Kevin is left all alone and bewildered on the front lawn to look back at the smoldering remains of his destroyed house and (now dead) parents while his nosy neighbors look on.The camera zooms out from the town, the world, and the galaxy to reveal its location on the Supreme Being's map. The Supreme Being's hands then roll up the map, ending the film.

title: Hong Xi Guan
synopsis: An opening narration explains that the ruling Manchurian Court has tracked a resistance movement against its rule, to the Shaolin Temple, which they were using as a cover for their activities. They ordered one of their chief enforcers, priest Pai Mei, to lead a raid on the temple. Pai Mei and his right-hand lieutenant, Governor Kao Jinzhong, led an army and set the temple on fire. In a bid to save his students, the head priest of Shaolin, Chi Shan, engaged Pai Mei in a crucial duel to the death.The opening credits play as Chi Shan and Pai Mei are shown engaging in their battle against a plain red-screen backdrop. The kung-fu duel seems close to evenly matched until Chi Shan executes a kick to Pai Mei's groin. But Pai Mei, as a eunuch, has no testes, and has further trained his body that someone trying to kick him in the groin only ends up with their foot stuck between his legs. Pai Mei knocks Chi Shan to the ground and drags him backward, by his trapped foot, several yards, before finally breaking both of the Shaolin high priest's legs.A contingent of rebels, led by a senior member of the movement, Hong Xiguan, is fleeing the Shaolin Temple. Many rebels are wounded from fighting, some dropping as they run. Hong has to urge his best friend, Xiao Hu, another leader, to keep running.They meet up with another of the rebel captains, Tong Qianjin, who is leading another contingent of rebel fighters. Hong is alarmed that Tong is the only member of his contingent to escape. Tong brings news that Chi Shan was killed by Pai Mei. Hearing that his teacher and master has been killed, Hong Xiguan goes into a rage and tries to run back to the temple to exact revenge. Tong, Xiao Hu and all of the other men led by Hong, all run after him to stop him. They know they've lost the battle, but a lot of their men escaped, and trying to avenge Chi Shan now will only result in their rebellion being completely wiped out.They run into an ambush of Manchurian archers, who take some more of the rebels down. Tong is wounded, an arrow piercing his leg. He pleads with Hong to take command, and then Tong takes a few soldiers to provide cover by engaging the archers. While the archers are reloading, Tong and his men rush at them, attacking with swords and hand-to-hand. Archers not under direct attack cannot fire again without hitting their own fighters.Tong is handling nearly the whole contingent of Manchurian swordsmen by himself when Governor Kao Jinzhong arrives. Governor Kao orders the small group of men with him to take Tong alive, but they are no match for him. Kao then sends his majordomo, a Qing Court Fighter, to battle Tong. The Qing fighter is more of a match for Tong and seizes an early advantage. But when Governor Kao mocks Tong and tells him not to resist, Tong becomes angry and and more fierce, taking on the Qing Fighter and the rest of Kao's men all together and beating them. Finally Tong reaches Governor Kao himself, and even Kao's kung fu fails against Tong's onslaught. Governor Kao is badly injured, and losing his patience, orders the archers to kill Tong, even at the cost of friendly casualties. The rain of arrows take down several Manchurian fighters as well as Tong, and even in death, Tong's face is frozen in a look of stoicism and determination that gives Governor Kao pause.At the Manchurian Court, Governor Kao, still hurt from his duel with Tong Qianjin, reports to the Royal Highness. The court is pleased with the success of the raid on the temple, but Kao is still deeply concerned with the ferocity of the Shaolin rebel resistance. Pai Mei is not worried. He is sure that his victory over the Shaolin high priest has spread fear through the resistance and sent the message that his kung-fu is unbeatable. He tells Governor Kao to simply continue his search without letup, and in the end, Pai Mei is sure that Kao will capture or kill all of the rebels.Hong Xiguan and Xiao Hu have split up. Xiao and his men make their way to the border of Gwangzhou and come across a small town where a theater troupe is putting on a play based on a local figure named Yue Fei. The troupe is also part of the resistance movement, and the Manchurians have tracked them to the town. A squad of Manchurian soldiers raid the theater. The troupe's leader, Master Chen, and a number of his men escape. Xiao Hu sees them being pursued and rushes to aid them, killing the Manchurian pursuers.Chen brings Xiao Hu to a 'red boat,' a group of Shaolin rebels that have established cover as theater performers traveling along the riverways by boat. Hong addresses the men on the boat, telling them to remember the temple and the priests and brothers who died defending them. They have come back to Kwangtung, a province under Governor Kao's control, to continue the fight. Hong says they must divide their strength and thus become more vulnerable, to ensure they are never completely wiped out. They will continue traveling and performing, discreetly giving aid to oppressed townfolk wherever possible and engaging Manchurians in ongoing guerilla tactics.At a riverside village, a woman named Fang Yongchun is giving a kung-fu demonstration. The Red Boats arrive as she is giving her demonstration, and many of the villagers run to greet them, which makes Yongchun jealous. She complains to her uncle about their continued arrival wherever she and he go to stage their own performance.The Red Boat troupe debarks from their boat, giving their pitch to the villagers about their latest show, and giving a small kung-fu demonstration as a sampler. A jealous Yongchun marches up to them and tells them that she thinks their kung fu is nothing special and orders them to leave the village. Xiao Hu, flustered, tells his men to escort Yongchun away. But Yongchun handles all of them easy with her own kung fu, proving far better than them. Xiao Hu spars with Yongchun himself, to find that she is able to take a stance so firm and stable that he cannot budge her legs and feet, even by kicking at them. She shrugs his blows off and then kicks him away, causing the villagers to laugh.Hong Xiguan arrives and he's impressed with her technique. Yongchun offers to take him on, saying she has plenty of fight left in her. Intrigued, Hong spars with Yongchun, and the two of them are evenly matched. As they battle, they recognize each other's style and technique: Hong is expert in tiger kung fu, while Yongchun is a crane kung fu artist. Uncle Fang finally tells Yongchun to back down. Hong is impressed with Yongchun's skill, apologizing on behalf of his men. Seeing that Yongchun is also a traveling kung fu performer, he invites her and her uncle to travel with them on the Red Boat. Yonchun isn't too thrilled about the idea, until she and Uncle Fang overhear Xiaohu call Hong, 'Brother Hong.' Immediately they both recognize the name and know that he is Hong Xiguan.Yongchun and Uncle Fang travel with the Red Boat, and Yongchun and Hong begin to grow increasingly close. Xiao Hu, who has become something of an incorrigible prankster from his time posing as a theater performer, jokes about needing to start calling Yongchun, 'Mrs. Hong' (a brief, amusing scene follows where Yongchun chases Xiao Hu about the boat to smack him one). But Xiao proves right, as soon after, Yongchun and Hong are married. Even on their wedding day, Xiao's mischief is near relentless, and both Hong and Uncle Fang must keep both Xiao and Yongchun (who's ready to give him another thrashing) reined in. Even when a cabin is prepared as a bridal suite for the marriage to be consummated, Hong has to throw Xiao Hu and the other performers off to get some peace with Yongchun.Xiao's persistence in trying to eavesdrop and spy finally drives Yongchun to some mischief of her own. She clamps her knees together while lying on the bridal bed, challenging Hong to push her knees apart if he wants to consummate the marriage that night. Hong finds that all his strength cannot budge Yongchun's sturdy legs, and she smiles in complacent satsifaction as she bids her husband good night.The next morning Xiao Hu finds Hong asleep outside the cabin, and Hong angrily drives him off the boat. Later in the day, as Uncle Fang is returning with the rest of the men with more supplies for the boat, he and Hong talk, and Uncle Fang has some advice for keeping Xiao Hu in line. That night, Hong tells Yongchun he's ready to give another try. She lies down on the bed and presses her knees together. After a few moments, Hong comes up with a kung fu technique that successfully pushes her knees apart. Yongchun petulantly swats at Hong, who fends her off as he tumbles into the bed and draws its curtains closed with his feet.Governor Kao finds out that the Shaolin rebels are using the Red boats as cover. He dispatches soldiers to burn the boats, flush out the rebels and kill them. Over several months, a number of boats are burned and its crew slaughtered. A few survivors manage to make it to Hong's boat. Hong says they have to give up their last boat, get to shore and all scatter, keeping in contact as necessary to continue their work. Xiao Hu, his demeanor properly respectful and disciplined now, wants to go with Hong and Yongchun, since Uncle Fang has gone up north.Months pass. Hong and Yongchun have settled in a house in a quiet town. One day Xiao Hu comes to Hong with urgent news. Yongchun is about to deliver a baby. The two rush back to Hong's home where Yongchun is being tended to by the town midwife. The baby is a boy, and Hong and Yonchun name him Wen-Ding.Nighttime, six months later. Yongchun sews a baby garment, her infant son in a crib nearby, while Hong studies a manual of advanced tiger kung fu. Hong is concerned because he hasn't been practicing lately, and he needs to get his kung fu back into peak form. His primary goal is still avenging his master, and his friend Tong. Yongchun is deeply worried. Tiger kung fu is nearly unbeatable, but Pai Mei is no ordinary kung fu expert, having strength unmatched by any. Yongchun wants to teach some of her crane style to Hong to supplement his tiger technique. But Hong, proud and stubborn, refuses to do this. Against Yongchun's better judgement, he's gotten her to make an agreement that they will not learn each other's kung fu technique. When Yongchun tells Hong that he'll have to practice ten years in order to depend entirely on tiger style, Hong says without hesitation, that he'll do so.Ten years have passed and Hong is able to rip the bark off of trees, and even knock down young trees with his bare hands. Meanwhile, Yongchun has been teaching crane kung fu to Wending.Yongchun has had Wending practice holding a basic crane stance for as long as he is able to concentrate on holding it. A group of young boys comes by and starts making fun of him. Because of Wending's hair style and learning the style of kung fu practiced by his mother, rather than his father, the other children think that Wending is overly effeminate. They hop into the yard where he is stancing and try to pull his legs apart to topple his stance, but he holds firm and throws them all off with a simple knee flex, which brings a smile to his mother's face. Finally Wending chases all of them away from the house and into the field. Yongchun tries to call him back but then relents.Hong, however, is less pleased when he sees Wending wrestling with one of the boys. However, when Wending hangs his head very sadly after a scolding, Hong also backs away and becomes more gentle. Moved to mischief, Wending leaps up on his father's shoulders, challenging Hong to topple him. If Hong can't, Wending says he gets to ride home on Hong's shoulders. Hong is at first reluctant because he doesn't want Wending to be hurt. But he finds that the ten-year-old's stancing and leg and foot strength has become very firm in its own right, and he can't topple his son off his shoulders. Looking both impressed and vexed, Hong carries his son home.But on arriving home, Hong needs to talk seriously with both his wife and son. Resistance scouts have found the location of a temple that serves as Pai Mei's base of operations. Hong tells Wending why Pai Mei has to be killed. Yongchun is still deeply worried that Hong will not be strong enough to beat Pai Mei using only tiger kung fu. She tells him that if Hong can, to kill Pai Mei, but if not, he should run. Hong looks at his wife and gives a nod of assent.Hong finds the Pai Mei temple relatively unguarded. Two acolytes sweep the long stairway leading up the hill. He easily subdues them and drags them to the outer cloister of the temple, where a group of acolytes see him and rush to defend. Even all together they are no match for Hong, and he is beating them from pillar to post.Pai Mei finally comes out and orders his acolytes off. Pai Mei is unworried and amused on realizing that Hong Xiguan has come for him. He tells Hong that the rules of the temple dictate that Hong must defeat two swordsmen before he can challenge Pai Mei himself to battle. The two swordsmen attack, and Hong dodges their swishing blades until he is able to disarm them both and use the swords to kill them.But in Pai Mei, Hong finds he's met his match and more, as Pai Mei easily fends him off, hardly attacking, seemingly toying with Hong as he taunts his adversary, trying to get Hong to admit that Pai Mei is better at tiger kung fu. When Hong lands a tiger claw strike to Pai Mei's groin, Pai Mei merely asks him, Can't you find it? Hong delivers a tiger claw strike to Pai Mei's eyes and face, but Pai Mei takes the impact like a stone statue and strikes Hong aside like a paper doll. Suddenly Pai Mei starts hitting back, delivering several blows that cause blood to trickle from Hong's mouth. Hong hears Yongchun's words to him in his head and, despite his pride, is able to silently force himself to admit he's been beaten. Striking aside the acolytes who are behind him, Hong turns and sprints out of the cloister to make his escape.Hong loses his footing as he rushes to the stairway and starts to tumble down them. Rushing to a massive urn-shaped stone sculpture at the peak of the stairs, Pai Mai shoves it off its small dais, causing it to roll down the stairs after Hong. The urn is about to roll over Hong and crush him when Xiao Hu leaps in front of it, deflecting it just enough that Hong is able to roll out of the way.In so doing, however, Xiao Hu is mortally wounded. With his dying breath, he tells Hong something crucial that he's learned; Pai Mei is weakest between the hours of 1 pm and 3 pm. Hong is distraught at seeing Xiao Hu die before his eyes, but Pai Mei and his acolytes are starting to run down the stairway. Turning, he leaps over a stone fence and finishes his escape.Back home, Hong is nursed by Yongchun. Wending is also saddened at the death of Xiao Hu, who was like an uncle to him. He rushes away, crying out that he needs to finish growing up into adulthood.Seven more years pass and Wending is a young adult. Although more mature, he has developed a determination to be able to outspar his parents that borders on obsession. Again, Yongchun is more forgiving than Hong. Over the last few years, Hong has been studying and relentlessly training in the more advanced aspects of tiger style kung fu. In his practice area is a bronze training statue, with many metal ball bearings fitted into various groves. Hong strikes areas on the statue to make the ball bearings slide down the grooves, and then plucks one out. Some of the ball bearings are painted with symbols corresponding to various times of day. Nearby are several wooden markers that catch the sun's shadow, and are also painted with similar time symbols. Hong finally catches a particular ball bearing with a particular symbol and starts to speak Pai Mei's name.Wending picks that moment to moment to leap in and try to catch Hong off-guard. Unfortunately, despite his growing skill and self-confidence, Wending can't quite match his father. Adding to this his obsessive desire to do so, and even at the dinner table he can't resist a chance to sneak in a blow. One night the sparring gets out of control, and several freshly washed clothes are knocked off the clotheslines, and a few of them are torn. Finally losing her patience, Yongchun makes them re-wash the clothes, and sew up the torn ones.Yongchun smiles as she sees Hong prick his finger on a sewing needle, but when the sight of his blood brings a hard look to Hong's eyes, her expression becomes concerned again. She goes to him and he says that the last few days have had him thinking hard about his oath. He's practiced particularly hard the past few years, and while he and his Shaolin brothers have continued fighting Manchurian rule, they can't make much progress unless Pai Mei were killed. Yongchun looks particularly worried, and more so the next day when Hong sets out. When Wending asks her about it, she confides in him that she's positive that Pai Mei let Hong escape last time because Pai Mei was far superior to him. But Hong's tiger kung fu has improved significantly by now, meaning Pai Mei will take him as much more of a threat. Yongchun is sure that if Pai Mei defeats Hong again, he'll make completely certain that Hong doesn't escape again.Hearing this, Wending rushes out to stop Hong from leaving. He's even ready to fight his father again to keep him from going to his death; battling harder than ever. After defeating his son again, Hong gives him a hard lecture on how many of Hong's fellow Shaolin fighters died for him and those who still fight today; including Chi Shan and Tong Qianjin... and Xiao Hu, who Wending himself said he wanted to emulate as a hero. Despite all this, Hong has bided his time, also waiting for Wending to reach young manhood, but now he feels that if he continues putting off his oath, he will lose the will and courage to continue fighting.When acolytes spot Hong's approach, they race in fear back to the inner parts of the temple. This time Pai Mei has many more fighters and Manchurian soldiers at his disposal, all of whom try to stop Hong. Wielding his staff with fury, Hong sweeps them aside. At the top of the stairs, Hong notes the sun overhead and jams one end of his staff into the earth, noting by its shadow that it's 1 pm. Fighting unarmed now, he again sweeps aside the guards and soldiers toward the inner cloister. Acolytes tell all the other fighters that Pai Mei has ordered them to disengage and block off all exits from the temple to prevent escape.Governor Kao is with Pai Mei in the inner cloister. Pai Mei looks pleased to see Hong, saying he knew there was no need to search for Hong, since Hong would return to the temple eventually, looking to make another attempt to kill Pai Mei.Governor Kao engages Hong first, and Hong handles him and his personal guard almost as easily as the rank-and-file fighters; Pai Mei noting how much improved Hong is. Hong engages Pai Mei and seizes an early advantage, staggering him briefly and ripping a patch off the front of his tunic. He staggers Pai Mei again, landing several tiger claw attacks. Pai Mei sees he can no longer toy with Hong and starts to fight more aggressively, like in his duel with high priest Chi Shan. But after striking Hong aside, he says that Hong is using the tiger style to lead his attack, and can't hope to reach Pai Mei's vital point.They clash again, Pai Mei hitting Hong hard and sending him sprawling. Hong notes by more shadows cast by the sunlight that the time is 3 pm. Pai Mei spots Hong looking at another shadow on the ground and smiles, taking a guard stance that gives Hong a moment's pause. When Pai Mei's hands both move to guard low, Hong attacks again. Once more they clash hard until Hong lands a kick to Pai Mei's groin.As with Chi Shan, Hong's foot becomes trapped there, and falls prey to the same counterattack that beat Chi Shan. Pai Mei knocks him to the ground, drags him backward by his foot several yards, and delivers crushing blows to both of Hong's legs. Standing over Hong and gloating, he says that Hong was almost right in deducing the location of Pai Mei's weak point, but over the years he's learned to move it at will, and now, when it's supposed to be down low near his groin, it's actually up high at the crown of his head.Pai Mei tells Governor Kao to take Hong alive, as there is much information about the Shaolin resistance that the Manchurian court can torture out of him. But as Kao's men move to seize Hong, he suddenly strikes out again, smashing aside the men and suddenly taking out Governor Kao's leg and using a finger strike right at his throat. Pai Mei executes a sweeping blow that sends both Hong and retinue guards all flying. Much to Pai Mei's outrage, Governor Kao is dead... and so is Hong.Hong had told Yongchun and Wending that he would return in ten days. When twelve have passed, Yongchun knows that her husband is dead. She tells Wending that if he wishes to truly aspire to be a hero, as his father and Xiao Hu, it falls on him to face Pai Mei. But she tells him that he shouldn't use his crane kung fu until necessary; at first he should use tiger style. But Hong had never been willing teach tiger style to Wending, because Yongchun had been teaching him crane. Hong's pride and stubbornness were such that he believed that tiger style should never be combined with crane. Yongchun remembers that Hong kept a study manual, and they need to find it.When Wending finally finds the manual, he finds to his dismay that age and vermin have caused most of the pages to be badly damaged, and it looks plausible that Hong had torn many of the pages himself after moving on to more advanced technique. When Yongchun asks to see the manual, Wending is afraid to show her how badly damaged it is, and manages to talk her into backing down by reminding her of her agreement with her husband never to learn each other's styles.Wending spends a year practicing and learning as best he can from the manual, although he cannot be certain exactly what it means when he catches specific ball bearings from the grooves in the brass training dummy. When he catches unmarked beads, he's not sure of the exact moment that a particular time marked bead fell out of the dummy, so he's not sure if he hit too fast, or too slow, or the wrong part of the dummy.Yongchun asks to see Wending do one of the exercises. When she tells him that one movement didn't look right, and he needs to do it again, Wending uncomfortably says that he worries it will remind her too much of Hong and make her upset. Yongchun becomes quiet again and tells Wending that he was right. She leaves the training area so Wending can practice alone again.Wending goes into the field, performing a number of tiger movements. Unfortunately the manual is too damaged to show the next followup moves. Finally Wending decides that at this point he'll stick to crane style.Finally Wending and Yongchun feel that he's as ready as he'll ever be. Wending has only trained in tiger style for one year, but he's trained very hard, and he has his crane style as a supplement, something Pai Mei has never faced in the Shaolin resistance.Wending goes to the Pai Mei temple. With the death of Hong Xiguan, the temple is mostly unguarded again, and Wending has little difficulty sneaking to the inner cloister where Pai Mei is meditating. Wending first asks if Pai Mei is the same person who killed the Shaolin high priest and Hong Xiguan. Pai Mei simply nods affirmative. Wending attacks, Pai Mei noticing that the initial strikes are tiger style. A large number of acolytes rush in after an intial clash between Pai Mei and Wending.Pai Mei notes that Wending's tiger kung fu is nowhere near the match for Hong Xiguan. He wonders aloud how many more Shaolin fighters there are, and asks Wending his name. When Wending tells Pai Mei his full name and says he's Hong Xiguan's son, Pai Mei is pleased. He's more than ready to kill Hong's son. Still, Pai Mei doesn't take Wending as much of a threat, until one of Wending's attacks rips loose a piece of Pai Mei's beard, and then in another clash, Wending tears the sleeves off of Pai Mei's robe. Pai Mei is confounded, as many of the moves Wending moves seem almost custom developed; he is used to facing standard tiger style, while Wending is combining it with crane. Pai Mei becomes angry and starts to fight harder, grabbing initiative and smashing Wending around several times. And even when he has the advantage, and after delivering a hard blow that has Wending bleeding from the mouth, Wending's kung fu is leaving him confounded and increasingly angry.They clash on the outer cloister. Wending fakes being hurt worse than he is, collapsing to the ground, and then delivers a kick. The kick hits Pai Mei in the groin, taking him off guard for a brief second, but then Pai Mei traps Wending's foot, the same as with Chi Shan and Hong. Pai Mei asks if Wending has any further tricks up his sleeve, before throwing the deadly attacks meant to break his legs and end the fight.But Wending does have another trick; he vaults up in the air with a crane maneuver and sits on Pai Mei's shoulders. As with Hong so many years ago, Pai Mei finds he cannot break Wending's crane stance and can't topple the young fighter from off his shoulders. He manages to throw Wending's weight backward and lands a scoop kick, but this only rights Wending's posture, and with a tiger move, Wending tears a large patch of hair off the crown of Pai Mei's head, and follows with a crane-beak attack right to the crown of Pai Mei's head, and then a double crane beak strike to his eyes.Having struck Pai Mei's vital point, the double crane beak attack proves completely devastating; Pai Mei screaming in wild agony, spinning around on his feet. He loses his balance, taking Wending with him as he rolls down the stairs. The camera freezes as Pai Mei convulses wildly into the air; a closing narration stating that the combination of tiger and crane kung fu was what finally killed Pai Mei.

title: A Deadly Adoption
synopsis: Robert Benson (Will Ferrell) sits in his luxurious garden on a sunny afternoon chatting to his friends, with his baby in his arms. He is an author and his friends agree that his bestselling books have helped them manage their money. They toast him and wish him well on his journey as a financial guru.Robert's pregnant wife, Sarah (Kristen Wiig) calls to him from the jetty at the bottom of the garden, Hey! Let's take the boat out! Robert tells his friends that the dock is rotten. Sarah is insistent and she leans back against the jetty railing which gives way. She falls, in slow motion, into the water. Robert (in slow motion) dashes into the water after her and they disappear below the surface. Suddenly bubbles arise and he emerges from the water with Sarah in his arms.As his friends stand around and watch, he pleads for her to wake up. He performs perfunctory mouth-to-mouth which appears to do nothing. He places his hand on her heavily pregnant stomach with another Please, Sarah!, which appears to revive her.An ambulance drives her to the hospital. Robert walks into her hospital room and she shakes her head. I'm so sorry, he cries.Opening credits begin to roll over a bird's eye view journey over a dark river and a wintery pine forest.Five years later appears on the screen as we pan up from Storm Lake to the Benson's dark, forlorn house. The remains of the dismantled jetty are strewn across the bottom of the garden.We are introduced to Robert's office. He is typing busily and we see certificates of his philanthropic endeavours from 2010 and 2011. He is interrupted by his New York agent, Debbie. My word, the recluse! she exclaims. Robert discusses his desire to help people with his new book. He confirms that he is clean and sober, when she asks him how everything else is going. However he opens his desk drawer to a large bottle of alcohol, and sighs.Sarah is at an outdoor local farmer's market full of happy, good-looking families. She is selling her organic, refined-sugar-free pies and honey. Her assistant Charlie (Bryan Safi) confirms that all the gluten-free produce went fast. Either this town's getting hip, or it actually tastes good. Sully Benson (Alyvia Alyn Lind) runs up to her mother with Robert not far behind. It is Sully's birthday and Sarah gives her a new bike. Robert looks aggrieved and complains that they had decided to wait another year before giving her a bike. We've talked about this, you know exactly what this will do to her blood sugar level! he declares. He relents in the face of his daughter's excitement.At Sully's birthday party, Sarah complains to her friend Julia (Antonia Stout) that Robert babies his daughter and is obsessed with checking her blood sugar levels. Something's different, she says. She confirms that Robert hasn't had a drink in 6 months. Julia asks how the baby search is going and Sarah is excited that the agency has a new birth mother for them to meet. She thinks that another baby will bring the old Robert back. Julia says she remembers the old Robert. He used to dance around this kitchen to corny old music!Later in bed, Robert and Sarah talk about the day. Robert says he is distracted by his book deadline and his anxiety around the day of Sarah's accident. Robert, stop beating yourself up. You know what happens, Sarah warns. Sarah hopes that meeting the new birth mother will improve matters. Sarah and Robert cuddle.The next day Sarah is watering the garden when a car pulls up. A lithe leg in high heels emerges from the car. Bridgette Gibson (Jessica Lowndes) appears. She is doe-eyed with a dewy complexion and long luxurious locks. Her white slip covers her large, pregnant belly. The adoption agency contact, Ellen (Debra Christofferson) introduces Bridgette, who is eager to see the Benson's huge luxurious house.Bridgette and Sarah chat nervously and Sarah shows her a photo of their daughter. Robert meets Bridgette and appears taken with her. When Bridget extends her hand in greeting she drops the photo and the glass breaks. She is flustered and apologies profusely. Bridgette says she lives in Idaho Falls and had to drop out because she couldn't afford it. She says she read one of his books: Debt: Not just a four letter word which preaches fiscal responsibility. She says she is living in a shelter, and that it would probably be better if she could rest a little more. She is carrying a boy and is 6 months pregnant. The Bensons look at her approvingly as she declares her love for her baby, and her desire to afford a house like theirs and to give him a life like the Bensons could.As Bridgette leaves she scolds Scully for not wearing a helmet. Let's keep that head safe so you can grow up smart like your mom and dad, says Scully gently. The Bensons are concerned about Bridgette living in a shelter. They invite her to live with them until the baby is born.Robert broods over Sarah's accident. Later that evening, they decide that they like Bridgette. If she's read one of my books she can't be that bad, affirms Robert.Bridgette arrives to her new home in a flowery slip. Sarah shows her the guest room. It's nice, it's so big! says Bridgette happily. Sully runs into the room. Sully asks her how the bike riding is going. My daddy won't let me take off my training wheels, she says sadly. Is that a baby in there? Sully asks, looking at Bridgette's belly. Bridgette says it is Sully's baby brother and asks her if she wants to feel it. Sully shyly declines. Bridgette asks for a bowl of ice-cream. Sarah says that because Sully is diabetic they don't keep sweets in the house. Just to warn you, I'm one of those organic people, says Sarah. Charlie arrives and meets Bridgette. I like her! he exclaims.Later that evening Bridgette texts someone, I'm here. She sighs and looks at photos of the family. She sees a magazine with Robert and Sarah on the cover, and rips Sarah's photo away. Oh Robert, what a mess, she says, rubbing her belly.Bridgette comes down to breakfast in a tiny camisole and shorts. They discuss plans for the day. Bridgette asks if she can head down to the dock to read. The Bensons look at each other awkwardly and say that the dock is off limits. Sarah and Sully head into town and Bridgette stays at home while Robert works.Robert's agent presses him to go on a book tour to sell his new books. She doesn't understand why he refuses to go on one since his last book tour 6 months previously. He blacked out last time and doesn't want a repeat of his boozy book tour. Bridgette knocks on his door and nervously asks him for sunblock. She bashfully says that she must be bothering him, but he assures her he is just used to being in his own Writer's world. It must get hard, Robert, she says demurely. Hard? he asks nervously. It is sometimes, he admits. Alone, all the time, she replies.Bridgette and Robert head into the store room. She hides the sunblock behind a bottle. I don't see it, she says. He reaches over her should in triumph. Found it! She turns around quickly into his arms and they share a too-close-for-comfort moment together. She looks up into his eyes disarmingly. If you need anything else, batteries, lighter fluid, it will be in here, he says uncomfortably.Back at the farm stall, Charlie asks Sarah about Bridgette. You just leave her in the house with him? Charlie wonders. She's six months pregnant, Sarah scoffs. Some men like that! says Charlie, and acknowledges that though he might be gay, he knows what men like. Although knowing Robert, he's probably hiding in his attic too afraid to even talk to her.Robert steps outside onto the patio to see Bridgette sleeping lazily in the sunshine. Her breasts heave gently, and she opens her eyes to see Robert staring at her. Bridgette says she is too tired to go into town. Sarah is disappointed to see Robert's text letting her know they are staying at the house.Later that day, Bridgette argues harshly with someone on the phone while in a coffee shop. These things take time! Would you stop freaking out! Charlie bumps into her, and she softens completely once he reminds her of his friendship with the Bensons. When he asks to feel her belly, she declines awkwardly. Charlie watches her walk away with a questioning look in his eyes.Later at dinner they discuss the town. Bridgette agrees with Robert that she prefers a smaller quiet lake. She tells a story about an ex-boyfriend who made her sit on the front of his large boat in a bikini just to show me off. Sarah talks about her relationship with Charlie and how he encouraged her to expand her business. Robert says he hopes to retire. Sarah can work and I'll stay at home with the two kids. That sounds perfect, says Bridgette wistfully. Bridgette shares with the family that she is overjoyed her baby will have such a perfect home. Sarah says that she, too, will have a perfect life one day. I hope it's in a town like this with a family like yours, Bridgette replies. That night Bridgette watches over Sully as she sleeps.The next morning Bridgette teaches Sully to ride without training wheels. She lets her go straight into the road as car drives by. Sully screams and disappears out of sight. She runs into a greasy looking tattooed hunk. Bridgette knows the man, Dwayne. She tells him he has to wait for her at the cabin, and leave straight away. As he leaves, Bridgette soothes Sully. Men like that, you gotta be careful, Sully. Most of them just want to use you. She tells Sully to keep the encounter with Dwayne a secret.Later Sarah and Charlie agree that Robert has been a little off lately. She sends Charlie to the store for coffee.Bridgette and Robert sit watching the lake. He tells her about Sarah's accident and the loss of their child. The worst part is, I blame her. If she just hadn't acted so foolishly. Sometimes I think I may never love her the way I used to. It's funny, I've never told anyone that before. He agrees that he might feel safe around Bridgette. He asks her if she is happy. She think she will be happy, soon. You really are a strange girl, Robert muses. They chuckle.Charlie, on his coffee run, sees Bridgette and Dwayne arguing in the street next to his green pick-up truck.Sarah and Charlie sit by the fire in the evening. Charlie blames Sarah for leaving chocolates in the pantry. You know the dangers of diabetic ketoacidosis! he accuses. Sarah says that Robert has to trust Sully. Even since you got back from your last book tour you have completely shut down! It is suffocating! What is going on? Sarah demands.The next day Bridgette prepares to have a shower, Sully rushes into the room and sees her in her underwear. Bridgette is wearing a fake pregnancy belly. She assures Sully that some women don't show when they're pregnant and she wants the Bensons to believe her that she really is pregnant. Bridgette makes Sully promise not to tell, otherwise something really bad is going to happen.The next day, Bridgette asks Sarah if she can take Sully to the park. Robert's idea. Wanted to check w/ you :) Bridgette tells Robert that Sarah asked Sully to take her to the farm stand. Robert agrees, but looks suspicious. He goes to her room, which is vacant. He feels her silky pink camisole. He finds the Debt book Bridgette mentioned earlier (Dare to Save). It has an inscription: To Joni - Don't stop Daring. Robert.He flashes back to his last book tour at a busy bar. He is drunk and a red-head asks her to sign his book to her, Joni Mathers. They run out into the rain laughing and kissing. Not here, she says and takes him to her motel room. After they have sex Robert sits with his head in his hands. It'll be our little secret, she says. Lightning flashes and we see that Joni is, in fact. Bridgette.Robert rushes to Sarah to ask her where Sully is. They call the police. Robert is asked why he went into Bridgette's room and why she might want to take Sully. He says he is just concerned and has no idea. Sarah thinks that Robert is overreacting. The police show the adoption agency's picture of Bridgette to the Bensons. She is a different woman and not the Bridgette they know. They realise they have been duped.Bridgette/Joni drives to the cabin in the woods with Sully. We'll get crazy money, smiles Joni.That evening, Robert admits his infidelity to Sarah. I did something I can never take back. And it consumes me every day. I know you hate me, but I hate myself more. Sarah denies hating him for lying. I hate you for endangering our child!In the morning, Sully wakes up groggily as Joni watches her from the doorway. Joni has transformed: she wears heavy make-up has ratty hair extensions and is dressed in a very revealing outfit. Joni says that Sully's parents had to go and help a sick friend. Sully says that she has a stomach ache. Joni realises that she forgot Sully's diabetic medicine. Dwayne says that his brother had the same condition: Low blood sugar. Just give her a couple candy bars. Dwayne heads into town to find candy. He tells Joni to call Robert and demand ransom.Charlie is at the police station and informs them about the fight he saw Joni having with Dwayne. Charlie can't remember anything much about the car. He describes Dwayne in detail.Robert searches through his emails to Ellen, the adoption agent. He hasn't heard anything from her. Charlie spots Dwayne in town. He follows him to the lake cabin, and calls Sarah along the way. The call breaks up.Charlie snoops around the house and is knocked unconscious by Dwayne. Dwayne just wants to leave. Joni wants to stick to her plan. Dwayne and Joni take Charlie out to the forest and shoot him.Slow motion montage of missing child posters, and sad folk music.The police tell Sarah that Ellen has been murdered. They show her a picture of Dwayne, and tell her he is wanted in Texas in connection with two murders. The policeman asks Sarah if it possible that Joni and Robert are together. Sarah is speechless.In the cabin, Dwayne is concerned that Joni is going to meet Robert. Sully is still sick. Dwayne fights with Joni. You're not keeping the kid! I'm in this for the money, he says. Dwayne is not happy.Joni confronts Sarah in her garage. Joni reveals that she was 3 months pregnant with Robert's child. She lost the baby and was furious when she saw Robert and his family on the TV. I hate you for stealing him away from me, she growls. They fight and Sarah is overpowered. Joni puts an unconscious Sarah in the drivers seat and pipes the running car's petrol exhaust into the car, in an attempt to suffocate Sarah.Joni finds Robert and attempts to persuade hi to run away with her. Robert demands to know where Sarah is and pushes Joni away. Robert, you're acting very strange. Don't you get it? We have everything ok? We can start our lives together. This is what we always wanted. You told me you were unhappy. Robert tries to call the police and Joni shoots him in the arm. Robert tries to convince Joni to take him to Sully. He lunges for the gun and it goes off. Robert falls to the ground. Joni runs away.Back at the cabin, Dwayne realises that their plan was about Robert all along. He refuses to let Sully go with Joni. Joni shoots Dwayne. I'm your new mommy now, Joni assures Scully.Back at the hose Robert comes to and rescues Sarah from the garage. He walks out of the slowly opening garage with Sarah in his arms to the sound of heroic trumpets. He lays her on the floor. Sarah, breathe! he demands as he gently touches her face. Sarah tells Robert about the cabin.Robert is determined to rescue Scully. The only other way out of Storm Lake is across Mackinaw Bridge. Robert, you, you can't, says Sarah faintly. Robert looks up, determined.Robert powers his boat down the lake, his wedding band gleaming in the early dawn light. He wears a look of grim determination. A distressed Sully and erratic Joni drive out of town. Dwayne is found by the police and arrested.Sully looks at Joni, crying and sick. Robert motors down the lake, parks his boat and stands in the middle of the bridge. Joni appears in Dwayne's pick-up and tries to mow down Robert. Sully squeals and pulls the steering wheel. They crash. Sully runs towards Robert. Joni interrupts their reunion angrily and the Bensons stare down the barrel of her gun. You used me, Robert. You are never going to use me again, she declares. She demands Sully return to her. Robert whispers something into Scully's ear. I trust you, ok? Robert says to Scully.Scully walks hesitantly towards Joni. She stops and dives off the edge of the bridge. Robert follows her. They swim to the motor boat and struggle to start the engine. Joni takes careful aim and is about the pull the trigger. We hear a shot ring out and see a bullet wound on Joni's shoulder. Sarah stands at the end of the bridge, having mortally wounded Joni. Joni falls, in slow motion, into the water.Six months later, Scully is riding on her bike without training wheels. The sun is shining. Gospel music is playing. Sarah and Robert are in the kitchen. Robert looks on adoringly as Sarah rolls out some pastry. She sure loves that bike. I told her she could ride it into town tomorrow, says Robert. Look at you, smiles Sarah. Not a care in the world! Robert acknowledges that she can't be a baby forever. At some point you just have to trust her.An upbeat song comes on the radio. I love this song! Robert exclaims. He turns up the volume. He invites Sarah to dance with him. Scully skips into the kitchen and dances with her parents. The dancing goes on. They keep dancing. Sarah boogies. Robert pretends to play the trumpet. Sarah does the twist. They continue to dance.They fade away and the words inspired by a true story appear.

title: Rocky II
synopsis: Picking up immediately after the events in the first Rocky movie, Rocky II begins with the events of 14th round of the Bicentennial New Years Day fight from the first movie. The fight lasts the entire 15 rounds with each fighter suffering many devastating injuries. After the fight, Rocky calls out for Adrian, who runs down to the ring. As Creed is announced the winner by split decision, Adrian and Rocky embrace, and Rocky tells her that he loves her.After their championship bout, Rocky (Sylvester Stalone) and Apollo (Carl Weathers) are taken by ambulance to Pennsylvania Hospital in Center City (a WCAU-TV Channel 10 news truck follows behind the ambulance), where they meet once again in the hospital lobby with a mob of reporters. Apollo Creed, who retained the championship on points, is furious at Rocky, the first man to go the distance with him, and starts clamoring for another chance to knock Rocky out. Rocky goes to Apollo's room that night and asks Did you give me your best? to which Apollo answers Yeah. Rocky declines talk of a rematch and tells Apollo that he is quitting boxing. Rocky's decision to retire is strengthened when doctors tell him he needs surgery for a detached retina.Following his hospital stay, Rocky proposes to Adrian (Talie Shire) in front of the tiger exhibit at the Philadelphia Zoo, and they later get married in a private church ceremony. Rocky begins to enjoy the profits from his fight with Apollo. He buys his first brand new car which is a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am (even though it's still supposedly 1976), goes on a shopping spree (purchasing a black leather jacket with a tiger on the back for himself, a fur coat for Adrian, and some gold wristwatches, to name a few), and buys a two-story row house in another Philly neighborhood. He also convinces his previous employer, the loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell), to give Paulie (Burt Young) his old collecting job. Rocky then opts to earn money by appearing in television commercials. His new career, however, is quickly derailed by his sub-par reading skills, which leads to a clash with the director of his first commercial.Over the next few months, Rocky, unable to find white-collar work due to his lack of education beyond the 8th grade, and after being laid off (because of cutbacks) from the meat packing plant where Paulie previously worked, gets a job helping out as an assistant trainer at Mickey's gym. Adrian, now pregnant, returns to her old job at the pet store. Running short on money from his unwise spending spree, Rocky also hands over his new Trans Am car to Paulie, who agrees to take over the insurance payments.Meanwhile, Apollo Creed has been receiving hate mail about his split-decision win over Rocky and is filled with anger and frustration: the letters alternately accuse him of deliberately carrying that chump (Rocky) the distance or state outright that he should have lost and has no business calling himself the champ. Determined to prove himself and win back the respect of his fans, Apollo elects to try and pressure Rocky into another fight, despite protests from his trainer, Tony Duke Evers, to find a new contender to fight against (when asked by Apollo what Tony is afraid of, Tony replies He's all wrong for us. I saw you beat that man like I ain't never seen no man get beat before. And the man kept coming after you.). Rocky himself begins to have second thoughts about the fight, but because of the pressure applied by Apollo, Rocky decides to accept the challenge for a rematch against Apollo on Thanksgiving 1976 and begins training once again.Mickey is unwilling to train Rocky at first, due to his bad eye. However, after seeing Apollo making fun of Rocky on public television, he becomes furious with Apollo and agrees to train Rocky. Mickey decides he wants the left-handed Rocky to learn to fight right-handed in order to better protect the eye, and to give him a surprise advantage by switching back to left-handed with the intention of throwing off Apollo's timing and confusing him. He also focuses on improving Rocky's speed by using an old training method from his own boxing days: he forces Rocky to chase a chicken around a vacant lot, stating, If you can catch this thing you can catch greased lightning.However, Adrian's opposition saps Rocky's resolve and his training suffers. When Paulie confronts Adrian about her opinion, her angry reaction creates a serious medical condition that breaks her water prematurely. During the birth of their son, Adrian falls into a coma, and as a result of the premature birth, their son is placed into an incubator at the hospital ICU. Rocky breaks away from training to spend every waking moment either at her side or in the hospital chapel with Mickey, not even seeing his newborn son until several days later when she recovers. When Adrian emerges from the coma, she tells Rocky to win and he restarts training in earnest with Mickey for the rematch with Apollo. His condition improves dramatically with increased strength and speed.As with the first fight, Rocky's training includes his famous brisk run throughout the city of Philadelphia. This time, however, he is greeted with the cheers and encouragement of onlookers as he runs through the streets of South Philadelphia, having become a local celebrity following his narrow loss to Apollo. Along the way, children and pre-teens begin to follow him, their numbers increasing dramatically block by block. By the time he reaches the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Center City, hundreds of young people have joined in. Ultimately, they follow Rocky to the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, enthusiastically chanting his name as he lifts his arms in a victory pose.Rocky and Apollo once again fight an intense battle in front of a standing-room-only crowd at the Philadelphia Spectrum. Paulie and a still-recovering Adrian stay home to watch the match on their TV set. Gazzo personally attends the match with a front-row seat as in the first film. Unlike the first match, Apollo gets off to a fast start, flooring Rocky twice in the first two rounds and building a huge lead on the scorecards as the fight goes on. But throughout the fight, Rocky pounds away at Apollo on and off, turning the fight into a brutal battle.At the start of the 15th and final round, Apollo's trainer begs him not to try to go for a knockout, as he can win simply by avoiding Rocky. Apollo, desperately wanting to prove he can knock out Rocky and very frustrated that he keeps coming back, disregards the advice. Mickey tells Rocky to switch back to boxing left-handed now, and although Rocky initially refuses, he switches back, landing several crashing lefts. Rocky hits Apollo with a final punch that knocks him down, but from sheer exhaustion, Rocky also goes down to the canvas. The referee starts the final ten-count as the fighters struggle to their feet.At the count of 9, Apollo, finally realizing all but too late that the last fight was not fixed, collapses while reaching for the top rope, while Rocky picks himself up and is declared the WBA's new Heavyweight Champion of the World. In his post-match speech, he thanks Apollo for another hard-fought battle, Mickey for training him, and God. Rocky states Except for my kid being born, this is the greatest night in the history of my life, and I just want to say one thing to my wife who's home: Yo, Adrian! I did it!

title: How to Steal a Million
synopsis: Paris, 1966...Monsieur Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffin), the current head of the Bonnet family, custodian of the family's legendary collection of fine art, and a noted collector in his own right, is offering one of his prized paintings at auction. A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous $515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed. The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work, he boasts. He didn't have to, Papa, Nicole retorts, he WAS Van Gogh! She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces. He replies that he only sells them to wealthy, private buyers, who get an undeniably fine painting in return.A noise in the driveway sends them both to the window: An armored car, a police van, a black limousine and half a dozen motorcycles have arrived and parked in front of the house. Nicole is terrified that the authorities have at last discovered Bonnet's hobby, but Bonnet explains that he has simply agreed to let the Claver-Lafayette Museum display their exquisite statuette of Venus, purportedly carved by 16th Century sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, in their latest exhibit. Nicole is not reassured: Their Cellini Venus is also a forgery...carved at the end of the 19th century by Bonnet's father, using Bonnet's mother as a model. Unlike paintings, she tells her father, it's an easy matter to detect forged sculptures. Bonnet brushes aside her concerns: since he's merely lending the statue, not selling it, there will be no reason to test its authenticity.He runs downstairs (followed closely by Nicole) to greet Monsieur Grammont (Ferdinand Gravey), the museum director, who is here with his assistants and an armed escort to transport the Venus. Bonnet shows him into the library, where the Venus stands in solitary splendor in its own special niche. Grammont is moved almost to tears by the sight of it...he congratulates Bonnet for keeping this fine piece in France, though he must have had many lucrative offers to buy it. Bonnet smiles modestly, and says, Well, after all, one is still a Frenchman. The Venus is handed over, secured in a heavily padded case, Grammont thanks Bonnet effusively and leaves. Bonnet is jubilant, but Nicole is still worried. He waves off her concern, saying that her basic trouble is that she's honest....but I don't tell you that to hurt your feelings, he adds kindly. I get dizzy spells when we have these conversations, Papa, she complains. He invites her to attend the gala opening at the museum that night...she firmly declines.The Cellini Venus is the star of the exhibit, and Bonnet the most celebrated guest at the gala. Davis Leland (Eli Wallach), a wealthy American industrialist, is also present. He has recently taken up art collecting, and is pursuing it as obssessively as he pursued the acquisition of his millions. He is so taken with the Venus that he determines to find out all about Bonnet and his family...with the goal of somehow acquiring the Venus.The Bonnet chateau is dark and quiet...the only inhabitant is Nicole, lying upstairs on her bed in her nightie, engrossed in a lurid paperback mystery. Downstairs an intruder has gained entry, and is quietly creeping around the main floor, looking over all the paintings with a small flashlight. He stops when he finds Bonnet's new Van Gogh, takes it down from the wall, and chips off a minute particle of the paint. He tucks it into a little plastic envelope, and stows it in his pocket. He then starts to examine the painting, carefully. But he makes a slight noise, which Nicole hears upstairs, and she comes down to investigate. She gets halfway down the staircase, sees the intruder, and stifles a scream. Then she plucks up her courage and takes an antique duelling pistol from a display on the wall. She makes her way to the bottom of the stairs, levels the pistol in his direction and turns on the lights.Startled, holding the Van Gogh in front of himself like a shield, the burglar whirls around to face her. He (Peter O'Toole) is no ordinary burglar: he's tall, slim, blue-eyed, handsome, and very distinguished-looking in a dinner jacket. Don't move, she tells him, Put that painting down. He does so, and she starts to call the police. Then she notices which painting he was holding. Why...did you choose that particular painting? she asks, uneasily. It was the handiest, he replies, promptly. He sees her hesitation, and decides to press his luck, a bit. Look... he says, don't call the police. Give me another chance. You see, I was only taking one painting...and you have so many...chances are you wouldn't even have noticed. Don't be impudent, she scolds. But she can't afford to have official attention drawn toward her father's latest forgery. He puts the painting back, and she puts the phone down. Well, I don't know why, she says, but I'm going to let you go. She sets the pistol down on the phone table, and as she does so it goes off, terrifying them both and grazing the burglar's arm. They both faint. He revives first, pats her cheek, fans her face with his coat tail, and when she awakens, he points out that he's the one who's bleeding.She takes him to the kitchen, pours him a drink and bandages his arm. He complains about the wound and the doctoring, even though it's only a minor scratch. For a burglar, you're not very brave, she remarks. I'm a society burglar, he retorts, I don't expect people to rush about shooting me. She finishes patching him up, and tells him he is free to go. He continues to push her, though, as if he's trying to see how far he can go before she finally loses patience and calls the police. He tells her he won't be able to drive home, with his wounded arm. Exasperated, she offers to call a cab...and pay for it. He points out that his car is outside her house, and the police may ask questions...and after all, he is wanted. She finally agrees to drive him home, and while she's pulling on her boots, and putting a coat on over her nightie, he asks her for a cigarette...and then a match...all while openly admiring her legs.They jump into his little yellow Jaguar, and she drives him to the Hotel Ritz (You're a very chic burglar, she grumbles). Then she realizes she's on foot, in her nightie, in downtown Paris, in the middle of the night...with no way of getting home herself. He has the doorman wave down a taxi for her, and while it's turning around, he asks her for a final favor. Like an idiot, he says, I forgot to wear gloves. Would you just give the edge of the painting a quick wipe with a clean cloth, when you get home? She stares at him in disbelief. Oh, you're mad, she says. I suppose next you'll want a goodnight kiss. Well, I don't, usually, on the first acquaintance, he replies, but you've been such a good sport.... And he lays a lovely one on her that leaves her stunned and speechless. He puts her gently in the cab, bids her good night, and waves as they drive off. Simon Dermott, society burglar, hurries upstairs to his room, takes out the tiny spot of paint he chipped from the Van Gogh, and examines it with a set of jeweler's glasses. He lights a cigarette, thinking...and smiles, remembering.Bonnet is at home pouring a glass of champagne when Nicole walks in. He starts to tell her of the gala...she interrupts and tells him about the burglar she caught. He quickly grasps the implications of what might have happened had she called the police, and assures her she did the right thing in letting the burglar go. Still somewhat dazed, she starts up to bed, then pauses...she takes Bonnet's handkerchief from his pocket, wipes the edge of the painting with it, and tucks it back into Bonnet's pocket, while he watches, a little bewildered. She starts back up the stairs, and he asks her, uneasily, This tall, good-looking ruffian...he didn't molest you in any way, did he? She stops, considers, then replies softly, Not much, and continues on up to bed.Next day she goes to the museum to see the Venus in the exhibit for herself. She turns to leave, and almost bumps into Simon Dermott. Startled and indignant, she is trying to get rid of him when Monsieur Grammont sees her, and comes over to greet her. Simon horns in, introducing himself as an old shooting partner of Miss Bonnet's. Monsieur Grammont offers to tell her about the special security arrangements they've made. Nicole tries to disengage, but Simon expresses interest, so Monsieur Grammont launches into an explanation. The little statue stands on a marble pedestal, with a circuit of infrared beams surrounding her. If anyone tries to reach through the invisible barrier to grab her, an alarm sounds, and both museum security and police respond. Simon wants to linger and hear more, but Nicole drags him away, out of the museum. Outside she tells him to go away, and leave her alone. He tries to talk to her, but she speeds off in her little car so quickly he spins around and almost falls in the street.Simon arrives at the office of Monsieur Bernard Desolnay (Charles Boyer), a well-known and reputable dealer of fine art. Desolnay greets him with enthusiasm, and asks if he had a chance to go to Bonnet's home and look at the Van Gogh. Simon nodds, and Desolnay says, And it bothers you, doesn't it? Not a bit, replies Simon, it's a great Van Gogh. Of course it is, agrees Desolnay readily, But who painted it? It develops that Desolnay has suspected Bonnet for some time. Simon points out that he has a statue worth a million dollars on exhibit...he certainly doesn't need the money. Desolnay speculates that it has more to do with ego: Bonnet studied painting as a young man, and like many art students, copied the Old Masters to learn their secrets. In the process he must have learned that he could imitate them perfectly, and now he enjoys fooling the world. Simon wonders idly if Nicole is in it with him. Desolnay replies, In what? According to you there's nothing. Oh, that's right, says Simon, catching himself. Well, you're wrong, you'll see, declares Desolnay.Later, Bonnet enters Nicole's bedroom, and asks about her plans for the evening. She tells him she has a date with Davis Leland, an American tycoon she met that day. Bonnet is surprised and interested. He tells her that Leland once bought a Toulouse Lautrec painting from him. Your Lautrec or Lautrec's Lautrec? she asks, warily. Mine, of course, he chuckles. Nicole is instantly uneasy again: Not only had Davis not mentioned that fact, but he had behaved as though he'd never heard of her father, and had no interest in art at all. She fears he must be up to something...or suspects something.They dine at an upscale restaurant. Davis is quite taken with Nicole...he sometimes has trouble relating to women, he tells her...but she's just like a member of the board. He's called to the phone, and as soon as he's out of sight, Simon (who apparently had him paged) sits down at the table. She is suitably annoyed, but he tells her he must talk to her, and gives her his room number at the Ritz. Then he leaves, and Davis returns. Davis finally admits to Nicole that he arranged their meeting because of his interest in the Cellini Venus, and hoped she could help him acquire it. Relieved, she kisses him, and tells him it's not for sale...but if it was hers to sell, it would be his in a heartbeat.Next morning, she tells her father of the exchange, and they share a short-lived moment of relief. The butler (Bert Bertram) announces that a representative from the museum (Eddie Malin) has arrived. It seems that the museum has arranged to insure the Venus against damage or theft while it's on exhibit. Monsieur Grammont was supposed to have gotten Bonnet's signature on an insurance form the day he picked it up, but had neglected to do so, and he is here to correct the oversight. When Bonnet has signed the papers, the representative asks if he'd like to be present at the technical examination, which he has just authorized. Technical...examination? Nicole and Bonnet ask in unison, dumbfounded. Yes, replies the representative. A mere formality, of course...It will take place on Friday, and you have the right to be present. He leaves, unaware of the bomb he has dropped on their world.The myth of the Bonnet collection is about to be exploded. Once the Venus is exposed as a forgery, anything else that has been bought, owned or sold by Bonnet will be tested and retested until every forged piece is brought to light. Bonnet urges Nicole to leave the country and let him face the scandal alone. But she refuses, determined to stand by him, and as she comforts him, an idea occurs to her. She asks him for the number of the Hotel Ritz.Simon enters the bar at the Ritz, and walks right by Nicole, who is disguised in a black lace cocktail dress and a little black pillbox hat, with black net veil and domino-style mask attached. She Pssst's at him, and motions him back to her table. He's astonished by her odd appearance and behavior...and stunned when she asks him to help her steal the Venus. He wants to know why, but she steadfastly refuses to tell him, and at first, he emphatically refuses. But she is so heartbroken, so desperate (and so lovely), he can't bring himself to refuse her out of hand. He tells her he'll sleep on it. They agree to meet the next day to talk it over.Next day, they drive to the museum...he points out that there is a formidable presence of museum guards, and even more guards at the homes of the Minister of the Interior and the President, across the street. They go inside, and as he studies the security set-up, he notices a resemblance between Nicole and the Venus. Where were you in the middle of the 15th Century? he asks. I don't know, she retorts, but that's not how I was dressed, gesturing at the nude statue. He continues his reconnaissance. He notes that parcels are not permitted in the museum: they must be left at a desk in the lobby, but they are not searched...that there is a tapestry hanging on a frame in front of a fireplace...that there is a small utility closet at the bottom of the main staircase, the door of which is locked, but the key is kept on a hook at the back of the staircase. Exploring, he finds the guards' room, and goes inside. Posing as an official from the Ministry of Tourism, and asking indignant questions under the pretense that his sleeve became smeared with dust in the museum, he learns that the cleaning people come in every night at midnight. On his way out, he deliberately chooses the wrong door, and sees that it leads to the basement, and a possible alternate exit.They go for a walk in a nearby park. He sees a child's toy being demonstrated, a balsa-wood boomerang that soars in a circle, then returns to the thrower. He buys two. They stop at a second-hand shop, for a scrubwoman's outfit, and a plastic mop bucket. When they go back to his room at the Ritz, he tells Nicole to change into the clothes. Tired of following him on endless and seemingly unrelated errands, irritated at having no explanation as to what he is thinking, Nicole asks him suspiciously if they're planning the same sort of crime. Nevertheless, she puts on the clothes, and he starts to tell her what will happen at midnight in the museum. You DO have a plan, don't you! she exclaims, excited. Yes, he replies evenly. My plan is that I will be lying here in my bed with a good book, unless you tell me what this is all about. She's surprised and crestfallen...but she can't explain, so he tells her she must go. Tears fill her eyes, and he angrily tells her they won't change his mind. He orders her back into the bathroom to change out of the clothes, and leave. As she turns dejectedly to do so, against his better judgment, he tells her to meet him at the museum just before closing the following day. Overjoyed, she agrees, and almost skips into the bathroom. Simon hits himself in the head with the plastic mop bucket.Next evening, just as Nicole is preparing to leave for the museum, Davis Leland turns up at her house with an enormous diamond ring, and in a very efficient and business-like manner, asks her to marry him. Afraid that refusing him will mean argument and delay, she takes the ring and dashes away, arriving at the museum only a few minutes late. Simon is impatient and irritated...she explains to him that she was getting engaged, and he retorts that they still have a little time if she'd like to go back and marry the man.They check the parcel of clothes at the desk, and go on into the museum. He checks on the closet, and quickly unlocks the door. Then he takes a handful of coins, and puts them in a brochure, and places the brochure precariously on the edge of a statue's pedestal. Watch for normal human reactions, he says to Nicole, and they move over by the fireplace. A guard picks up the brochure, and the coins scatter...several people bend down to pick them up, while many others watch. Simon and Nicole use the distraction to duck into the fireplace behind the tapestry. The museum closes and as the guards escort the other patrons out, they slip down the stairs and into the tiny closet. The guards return and make a round of all the floors. One of the guards finds the closet unlocked, gives it a cursory inspection (slim Nicole and slim Simon have both squeezed into a tiny shelf area), then locks the door and returns the key to the outside panel. Nicole panics, but Simon is unconcerned. They wait for an hour in the tiny closet. Then they hear the guards come out of their room, and tramp all over the museum again as they make their rounds. Simon is pleased: now he knows the schedule.Using a powerful magnet against the wall at the back of the closet, he is able to remove the key from its hook, walk it around the outside of the closet, and bring it inside under the door. With a specially-fitted tube, a hook, and another small magnet, he's able to draw the key up into the keyhole, and open the door. He runs to the front desk, grabs the clothes and runs back to the closet. He helps Nicole to put the clothes on over her own clothes, then he takes out and assembles one of the little boomerangs he'd bought the day before. Exasperated at the close quarters (I hadn't counted on there being so much togetherness, she grumbles) and all the elaborate preparations, Nicole asks when they're finally going to steal the Venus. He tells her that one of the nice things about complicated mechanical systems is that they malfunction, and when that happens, you can always rely on normal human reactions. He asks her how she would feel if she was one of these guards, assigned to look out for a bunch of stuff she couldn't afford, and wasn't interested in, night after night. Irritated, she replies, wearily. Exactly, he says, and steps out of the closet onto the stairway.His first throw goes wide...but his second breaks the beam on the electric field surrounding the Venus, and a deafening alarm goes off. He grabs the returning boomerang and Nicole, and they both run back to the closet. The guards pour out of their room, and swarm all over the museum, and when the police arrive, they search as well. It's eventually determined that the alarm was false. The Minister of the Interior calls to complain about the noise from across the street. The head guard (Jacques Marin), a short, serious man, looks disgusted. A burglar alarm especially designed to give me heartburn, he mutters, as he resets it.Nicole realizes, for the first time, what a difficult and dangerous task they've undertaken. She tells Simon she wouldn't blame him if he left. Then what happens tomorrow when they test your million dollar baby? he asks quietly. She stares at him. It's a fake, isn't it, he says. She nods slowly, and asks how long he's known, and he answers: Since you first asked me to steal it. She asks why he'd help if he knew...he leans in and kisses her gently, and she whispers, That's why, in wonder. Oh, I'm so stupid, she says, putting her arms around his neck. Please...explain it to me again!After more explanation, he goes out to set off the alarm a second time. Again, the lights go on, the guards gallop all over the museum, and the police arrive to assist...again, they find nothing. This time, it is His Excellency himself who calls up from across the street to complain. The head guard is properly intimidated. He doesn't reset the alarm...he turns it off.Simon is stunned to find that his plan has worked. Nevertheless, he pulls himself together, and attends to business. He goes up the stairs and takes the Venus, and conceals it in the bucket. He tells Nicole to hide in the fireplace again, and when the scrubwomen arrive, to come out on her hands and knees, scrubbing madly, and no matter whatever else happens to work her way back to the guard's room. The guards' room? she asks. When they discover the Venus is gone, there will be guards everywhere but in the guards' room, he says, and tells her to hang onto her bucket.At midnight, the scrubwomen arrive, and set to work. The guards also come out, and start rounds. It is several minutes before a guard (Mustache) notices that the Venus is gone. He points it out to the head guard, who is shocked insensible for a long moment. Then he hoarsely cries, Alarm! --and all hell breaks loose, with guards running every which way, bumping into each other, and stumbling over scrubwomen. It is a few moments more before the head guard realizes that the alarm is not sounding...because it has been turned off. He quickly turns it on again, but it is still silent. Mustache finally reaches through the beam, and the alarm goes off, adding to the bedlam.Nicole has worked her way to the guard room, and goes inside. One of the guards is there, sitting in a chair, reading a newspaper. She turns to flee, but he grabs her and kisses her...it's Simon. They leave quietly down the basement stairs.Reporters gather at Bonnet's house next morning, to take pictures of the empty niche, and ask him how he feels about the loss of his precious statue. He plays his feigned grief to the hilt. Upstairs, Nicole is chatting excitedly with Simon about the caper on the phone, and they arrange to meet later at the Ritz bar. The reporters leave, and Nichol runs downstairs, and she and her father hug joyously in their relief. He offers to take her out to celebrate, but she tells him she has an appointment later, at the Ritz. She runs back upstairs, and he repeats, The Ritz, looking thoughtful.Davis Leland has come to Monsieur Desolnay's office, in a state of extreme excitement. He wants to try and find the Venus, and purchase it...at any price...no questions asked. Desolnay implores him not to pursue it, but finally gives him the name of someone he thinks may be able to help: Simon Dermott, currently staying at the Ritz.They meet at the bar in the Ritz, and Simon tells Davis that he already has a few feelers out...just idle curiosity...and he believes he knows who might be responsible. He warns Davis he'll be buying something that he will never be able to show, or even to acknowledge that he owns. Davis is undeterred. Simon asks if Davis is acquainted with any member of the Bonnet familly, and Davis admits he's engaged to Bonnet's daughter. Simon tells him that if he wants the Venus, he'll have to give her up...that if he doesn't, the people who have the Venus will suspect a trap and he'll never be able to acquire it. Reluctantly, Davis agrees. Simon says he'll be in touch, and Davis starts to leave the bar...just as Nicole arrives. As Simon watches, amused, Davis almost breaks a leg avoiding her, when she's only trying to return his ring.She sits down next to Simon, and begins to chatter about how thrilling the theft had been, for her first effort. It was my first, too, he remarks. This admission stops her in mid-sentence. She asks, puzzled, Then you're not a burglar? He shakes his head. Who are you? she asks, filled with sudden foreboding. I'm a private consultant who specializes in museum security, he says, deliberately. I have advanced degrees in art history, chemistry and criminology. I also specialize in tracing and recovering stolen works of art, and in detecting and exposing forgeries. She is so startled and dismayed she almost falls out of the booth. But he catches her, and at that moment Bonnet himself arrives, having correctly deduced the nature of Nicole's appointment. After Nicole introduces them, he asks what Simon intends to do. Simon replies that Bonnet has two gorgeous girls in his family...and he intends to keep the real one. But he has plans for the other girl as well, and he must leave now to make arrangements. After his departure, Nicole lets out a shocked little scream: Davis Leland's huge diamond ring is gone, too!Simon meets Davis at the airport, preparing to take off in his private jet. He hands Davis a crate, and tells him that he'll be contacted later for payment: the code word will be togetherness. Davis takes the crate into the jet, and hurries directly to the restroom, where he can be alone. There, he opens the crate, removes the packing and reveals the Venus, in all its illicit splendor. Then, to his wonder, he notices that the diamond ring he gave to Nicole is tied with a bit of ribbon around the Venus's neck.Bonnet is delighted...Davis is the only collector who will never dare to have the statue tested. He asks, rather tentatively, about the money Simon got for the piece...Simon says he asked a nice round figure, and traces a large zero in the air with his index finger. You, sir, are a forger, he says. It's my job to catch forgers. One of us has to retire. Fair enough, says Bonnet, Shall we flip a coin? I already did, replies Simon, You lost. Bonnet struggles with himself for a moment, then extends his hand to seal the bargain.Nicole and Simon are leaving France...they'll lie low for a while in England, and get married there. As they drive through Bonnet's front gate, another car passes them on the way in...a Senor Paravideo (Marcel Dalio) who has long been trying to get hold of one of Bonnet's paintings. Simon stops the little yellow Jag, and he and Nicole turn to watch. Bonnet greets Paravideo with delight, and shows him inside. Who's that? asks Simon, pointedly. Nicole's hesitation is very brief: Papa's cousin, she replies, innocently, from South America. He looks at her for a long time, then remarks, For someone who only started lying recently, you're showing a real flair for it. Oh, thank you! she says, smiling radiantly. And they're off. And they all live happily ever after!

title: The Witches of Eastwick
synopsis: This unsold TV series pilot opens with three young women, named Alex, Jane, and Sukie, playing in a little league game when they hear the coach make a sexist remark. All of a sudden, it starts to storm! We then see them laughing and running home in the rain as Alex screams: Ok, who conjured it?. We all did! yells Jane. The girls are apparently witches and all live in the same house together. They are also single and none of them have any children. That night, after much drinking and gossiping, they start talking about what the perfect man would be like and whether or not he really exists or is just too good to be true. Sukie then suggests that they just conjure him up using their powers. After much debate on whether or not this would be a good idea, they finally decide to try it.The next morning, a very obnoxious man comes knocking at the door. He's apparently just moved into the neighborhood and stopped by to borrow a cup of sugar. When Alex answers the door, he barrages inside without even introducing himself and goes right on trying to swoon the girls off their feet by ranting and raving. After a while, he finally introduces himself to be Darryl Van Horne! Both Jane and Sukie find him charming, but Alex knows better. She knows exactly who he is. Later that day, as Jane is teaching the kids music lessons at the school, Darryl arrives to surprise her. As Darryl begins to play the piano for her and the children, the school headmaster, Raymond Gentry, comes in to see Jane. As Jane listens to Darryl's beautiful music, the headmaster suddenly grabs Jane from behind. Jane then turns around and violently slaps him senseless in front of everyone! Embarrassed by what's just happened, Raymond fires Jane on the spot! That night, at a fancy restaurant, Jane tells the others what happened to her at the school. Jane is convinced he was under Darryl's spell and is determined on getting rid of Darryl once and for all. Alex agrees, but Sukie likes him and wants him to stay.

After Darryl gives Alex a personal tour of the house and all of it's artwork, she then sneaks away for just a moment in order to get some of his hair from one of his combs and his old shirt. They later go up to his bedroom, where he unsuccessfully tries to seduce her into his bed with him. For a moment, Alex is tempted but she then resists him and goes home. There, she, Jane, and Sukie mold a voodoo doll using the old shirt, his hair, and cookie dough. They then cast a spell on it so that When it dries, it'll crack and turn to dust. And so will Darryl. Just as they are cleaning the kitchen afterwards, Jane gets a phone call from Raymond, the school headmaster, who wants to apologize and give Jane her job back. That night, Jane arrives at Raymond's house to make amends. They both make up for what they did, but it becomes clear that Raymond is still trying to take advantage of her by trying to get her drunk with wine. Unaware to either of them, Darryl is watching them. He puts a spell on Raymond so that the entire truth just comes out.

title: High School Musical 2
synopsis: It's the last day of school, and the Wildcats are counting down the seconds until they're free. When the bell finally rings, they throw their papers in the air and celebrate with a song [What Time Is It?].While walking through the halls, the Wildcats all reveal what their Summer goals are: Jason (Ryne Sanborn), Zeke (Chris Warren), Martha (KayCee Stroh) and Taylor (Monique Coleman) all want Summer jobs to save up for college, whereas Chad (Corbin Bleu) wants to work to save up for a car (to take Taylor on a proper date), Kelsi (Olesya Rulin) just wants to write music, Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) wants to relax, Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) want redemption for her Winter Musical (and she also wants Troy), and Troy (Zac Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) just want to spend time together. Troy gives Gabriella a necklace with a T on it as a promise.After a game of basketball with the Wildcats and Coach Bolton (Bart Johnson), Troy gets a call from Mr. Fulton (Mark L. Taylor), the GM at Lava Springs country club, and is offered a job for the summer. With a little persuasion, he gets Fulton to allow all his Wildcats to join him.Ryan and Sharpay roll up to Lava Springs in Sharpay's pink convertible, where they're just as pampered and bowed to as in school, and its' revealed that Sharpay arranged for Troy's hire.As Sharpay, Ryan and the Sharpettes, Sharpay's back-up girls in every sense ( nm2657048, Tanya Chisholm and Kelli Baker) relax by the pool, Sharpay expresses her disgust at having lost her part in the musical, her hope for the club's summer talent show, the Star Dazzle show, and above all, her need for all things luxurious [Fabulous], ending the song when she sees Troy walk through the gates. However, her joy is short-lived when she sees that he's not waving at her, but at Gabriella, who has taken the lifeguard position. Enraged, Sharpay falls into the pool.When she confronts Fulton about the Wildcats, he tells her that the Lava Springs Board approved the hiring, meaning that their parents knew about it, as their parents are the owners of the club. Sharpay brings the issue to her spacey, yoga-loving mother (Jessica Tuck), who thinks it will be beneficial for her to spend the summer with her school chums. Sharpay, however, hears none of this, and demands that Fulton get rid of them, demanding that if he can't fire them, make them want to quit.Fulton joins the Wildcats in the kitchen, handing out tasks as rudely as possible, even reprimanding Gabriella when she clocks out for lunch 3 ½ minutes early. It's near-unanimous that the Wildcats are unhappy with the jobs they've been given, but Troy rallies them to charge the mountain [Work This Out].After their shift, Troy invites Gabriella out to the golf field for a picnic, where Troy reveals his concern for his future, while Gabriella expresses her joy at what will be her first summer in five years in one place, glad that she's here with Troy of all people. They dance around the golf course, unaware that theyre being watched by Ryan and Sharpay, the latter of which makes up an excuse for maintenance to turn the sprinklers on Troy and Gabriella, which gets them caught by Fulton, earning them both a strike (three strikes and their employment is terminated). Sharpay seems to not be worried or threatened by their relationship, as she clearly has something up her sleeve.The next day, as Troy and Gabriella walk into work, they overhear Kelsi singing a song she wrote for the staff's performance for the Star Dazzle show. Troy, is initially reluctant to sign up to perform (stating his singing career began and ended with the East High Winter Musical), but after singing a love song with Gabriella, written specially for them by Kelsi [You Are the Music In Me], he changes him mind.Ryan, who at Sharpay's request, had been spying on the Wildcats, tells her about the song, and Sharpay admits that Troy's participation in the talent show could be fantastic, though not beside Gabriella.Chad and Troy are requested as caddies for the Evans family, Sharpay bragging up Troy as soon as Mr. Evans (Robert Curtis Brown) joins them on the green (by helicopter). Mr. Evans is a University of Albuquerque Alumni (where both Chad and Troy hope to attend), who is extremely impressed with Troy's basketball and golf skills. At Sharpay's suggestion, Troy is excused from the rest of his shift to join the Evans family for dinner, along with more U of A Alumni. Sharpay offers him up to sing, but when he refuses she makes him promise in front of everyone to sing with her another time.Troy is excused from dinner, only to be intercepted by Fulton and brought to a secret stage where Sharpay, Ryan and the Sharpettes perform an elaborate, over-the-top song for him [Humuhumunukunukuapua'a]. Troy slips off to join Gabriella for the date they planned earlier in the day. They go for a moonlit swim, only to get caught once more by Fulton and receiving a second strike.At home, Troy expresses his guilt at his special treatment to his father, who tells him that though they're all friends now, and that's good, when they graduate, all his teammates will be chasing the same scholarships and opportunities as him, and that there's nothing wrong with working toward what he wants. He also gifts Troy the keys to an old, beat-up truck the pair have been repairing, stating You didnt think I was gonna drive this heap, did you?.The next morning, Troy is told by Fulton that hes been promoted, as the Evans family thinks he has untapped potential. Troy is awarded a $500 a week job, a locker full of fantastic, designer clothes (including Italian golf shoes), full use of membership facilities, his own set of clubs, and his own golf cart.Taylor worries that Troy is falling right into Sharpay's hands, telling Gabriella that she's basically offering him a college education just to sing with her in the talent show. Gabriella and Chad have faith that Troy is stronger than that, though when Troy snubs Chad, who is serving lunch to him, the Evans family and a bunch of U of A basketball players, Chad begins to agree with Taylor.Sharpay walks into a rehearsal room where Ryan and Kelsi are talking about ideas for the show, and demands Troy and Gabriella's duet, snatching it out of Kelsi's hands when she refuses to give it to her. She tells them that she and Troy will be performing it in the talent show, which angers Ryan, as he was planning on performing Humuhumunukunukuapua'a with her. Sharpay coldly announces the change in plans, but demands that Ryan still spy on the Wildcats for her, telling him she'll find him a spot somewhere in the show... or the next one. Ryan walks away in anger.Afterwards, Gabriella sees Troy playing basketball alone, adorned in a U of A Redhawks jacket. He promises to spend some time with her after his game with the Redhawks, and Gabriella tells him that promise is a big word, reminding him that the staff has a baseball game after work, one he promised he'd play in. Jason, Chad and Zeke all walk out, eager to play with Troy and the Redhawks, but Troy refuses, saying it's a closed practice. Though Chad expresses his annoyance, Troy leaves with the Redhawks.As Gabriella and Taylor are on their way to the staff baseball game, they come across Ryan, walking through the club grounds alone. They ask if he's going to the game, but he says that he's not staff; wasn't invited. The girls invite him, and he joins them in the golf cart to the game. The general consensus amongst the male Wildcats is that since Troy bailed on them, they don't want to do the show anymore, but the girls do, asking Ryan to put his amazing choreography skills to good use and help them. Chad tells Ryan that if [Ryan] wants to play ball, then grab a mitt, but he [Chad] doesn't dance. Ryan steps up to him, with a remark of You don't think dancing takes some game?. Ryan takes the pitcher's position, playing a fierce game against the Wildcats [I Dont Dance], and just barely losing. As he goes to walk away, Chad calls him back, telling him that he's not saying he'll dance in the show, but *if* he did, asking what Ryan would have him do. Ryan smiles to himself.Troy is then shown playing in the Redhawks' gym with their star players, watched by the entire Board of Directors, who admit that they like what they're seeing. During a break, Troy tries to call Gabriella, who's abandoned her phone in her bag as she celebrates with the Wildcats, including Chad and Ryan, who have switched clothes in a gesture of friendship. Chad asks him about where the ball skills came from, to which Ryan reveals that he was on the Newport, Rhode Island Little League World Series championship team when he was younger.The next day, as the sun is setting, Ryan and Gabriella talk about the show, and though Ryan says that he knows everyone thinks he's Sharpay's poodle, but Gabriella tells him that if they were thinking that, they're not thinking that today. Ryan shows her a dance step, and Troy walks up, misreading their linked hands. Ryan tries to show that he harbors no will will toward Troy, but when he brings up Gabriella's mother's brownies, Troy coldly cuts him off, saying Yeah, I know. I've had 'em. Ryan walks away, and after a look at Gabriella, so does Troy.The next morning as Troy walks into work, everyone makes comments about him bailing on their 2-on-2, and Troy defends himself, saying that Mr. Evans set everything up, not him. However, he and Chad explode on each other, Chad telling him that Troy's losing himself, and Troy denying it.Later that day, Troy and Sharpay rehearse their song for the Star Dazzle show, an up-tempo, jazzy, ridiculously over-the-top song complete with back-up singers, pyrotechnics, and bedazzled microphones [You Are the Music In Me (Sharpay Version)]. Sharpay tells Troy that the entire Scholarship Committee will be there to see him perform. Troy suddenly has a vision of Sharpay in a wedding dress, and excuses himself for some air.Troy is shown playing basketball alone the next day, but follows the music he hears to a rehearsal room, where all the Wildcats are dancing and having fun, rehearsing for the Star Dazzle show and being coached by Ryan. Sharpay also stumbles on this scene. The Wildcats file out after the song, but the only thing Troy sees is Ryan and Gabriella hugging before Gabriella leaves, too. Troy walks away, and Sharpay storms into the room to scold Ryan, telling him that she said to keep an eye on them, not turn them into the cast of Grease. Ryan doesn't care about losing the Star Dazzle award (which he and Sharpay have won several years running), and Sharpay asks when he became one of them, which Ryan takes as a compliment, and sarcastically tells her and Troy to have a good show.Sharpay, annoyed at Ryan's betrayal, tells Fulton that all employees need to work on show night, that she doesn't want any employees in the show. Fulton advises her to think about this, reminding her that the Wildcats are not just employees, but her classmates. Sharpay doesn't care, telling him to do it anyway.
Fulton give the flyers with the announcement to Taylor to distribute, who immediately tries to protest, but Fulton hears none of it, telling her that in the world of adults, sometimes, we have to perform tasks, however unpleasant, that are necessary for that all-too-important paycheck to land in our all-too-empty pockets!. Taylor offers him some calming tea before showing the flyers to the Wildcats, who know immediately that it's Sharpay's doing.Gabriella goes to confront Sharpay, telling her that Wildcats or not, she's ruining something Ryan worked extremely hard on. Sharpay doesn't care, claiming that Gabriella has been interfering with Troy's future by getting him written up twice, and that she had to step in just to save Troy's job. She tells Gabriella that she's just jealous that Sharpay won, to which Gabriella replies What's the prize? Troy? The Star Dazzle award? You had to go through all of this just to get either one?. Gabriella then quits, before warning Sharpay that she's doing serious damage to Ryan and their relationship and that she's too preoccupied with her reputation to notice or care. Sharpay leaves, offended, and Troy runs up to Gabriella, having heard most of their conversation. Gabriella tells him that hes changing, and its better that she knows this now. She quits and breaks up with Troy [Gotta Go My Own Way], giving him back her T necklace in the process.That night, Troy asks his dad if he seems different, telling him that none of his friends will talk to him and that he's been too focused on the scholarship. Coach hands him a picture of himself in his basketball uniform, telling him that he's absolutely sure he's gonna figure out the right thing to do.The next day at work, all the Wildcats ignore Troy, some even walking away when he sits at a table with them. Kelsi silently shows him one of the flyers about the employees not allowed to participate in the show, which he crumples up in anger. He goes outside and reflects on everything he's done and how he's been acting [Bet On It], telling himself that hes gonna turn it all around. He tells Sharpay that he's not doing the show, as he's asked Fulton for his kitchen job back and therefore, is not allowed participation. He tells her that he doesn't like the way they've both been treating his friends, so he's doing something about it. Sharpay tries to change his mind, telling him we can all hold hands around the campfire some other time! Right now, weve got a show to do, to which Troy replies, No, you've got a show to do. I got a kitchen to clean, and walks away.Sharpay reverts back to Ryan, telling him Humu Humu is back on, but Ryan refuses, telling her that he took her advice and sold his Tiki Warrior outfit online, and that she's always wanted the spotlight. Now you've got it.Kelsi had witnessed the entire scene between Troy and Sharpay, and told the Wildcats what Troy had done, who forgive him when he walks into the kitchen. Troy tells Chad that brothers fight, and Chad says that they're still brothers. Troy apologizes to Ryan for all his hard work wasted, and Ryan says that he doesn't really want to see his sister crash and burn... at least he *thinks* he doesn't, and that he wants Troy to sing with her.Troy tells Sharpay that he'll perform with her on one condition; the Wildcats get to participate, too. Sharpay reluctantly agrees. When Troy returns to the kitchen to tell the Wildcats, Ryan tells him that Sharpay wants him to learn a new song, and he and Kelsi immediately run to the rehearsal room to practice.Just before Troy goes onstage, he asks Sharpay why she switched songs, and Sharpay is confused, stating that she didn't learn a new song, and Ryan brushes past her with a smug Exactly. Sharpay is horrified.Troy walks onstage and begins singing, expecting Sharpay's accompaniment, but to his shock, he hears Gabriella. She walks through where all the Wildcats have gathered at the back of the show audience, joining him with a hug. They sing about making memories last and celebrating their friends and being young [Everyday], and are eventually joined at a chorus by all the Wildcats, who join them onstage. Gabriella grabs Ryan and brings him onstage, and Troy does the same with Sharpay. They finish the song by joining hands, and Fulton walks up to award the Star Dazzle award to Sharpay, but she grabs the mic at the last second, announcing that the winner is Ryan, for his choreography of the final number.After the show, the Wildcats, including Sharpay and Ryan all converge on the golf green, smiling and laughing. They see a shooting star and start dancing around the golf course. Gabriella toasts to the future, to which Troy replies, No, here's to right now. The two share their first kiss (something they've been trying to do the entire movie, but kept getting interrupted) as the sprinklers turn on, soaking all the Wildcats, who keep dancing.The last scene is a staff pool party, where Troy, Ryan, Chad, Gabriella, Sharpay and Taylor perform a song about finally getting the summer they wanted, and finally having some fun [All For One].

title: Invaders from Mars
synopsis: Psychologically terrifying space-invader movie made at the height of McCarthyism centers around 10-year-old boy astronomer betrayed by most of the adults he knows, including his parents. Small and cheap, but brilliantly and boldly helmed by William Cameron Menzies -- the production designer of Gone With the Wind -- Invaders from Mars had enough of a timeless paranoiac jolt to be remade, albeit poorly, by Tobe Hooper in the 1980s.
Back in the 50s, while Hollywood and Congress panicked and did some pretty cruel and crazy things in reaction to an alleged invasion of commies, Little Jimmy is figuring out who do you trust after learning that everything he's been told about authority -- family, the church, even the chief of police -- is a big fat lie. Interestingly, the person who defends and leads Jimmy in his insistence on conspiracy is a true alien for the time, a creature who somehow wafted through the cracks in the well-wrought PC system to become a lady doctor. The choice of such an underground avatar is reminiscent of George Romero's use of Duane Jones as the unambivalent protagonist in Night of the Living Dead (1968). With Hillary Brooke as mom, and Bert Freed as the top cop.I think it worth pointing out that there are two versions of this film ...one for the American market and one British. As I understand it the films ending was not well recieved by British audiences {a fate shared by the dream season of the TV series Dallas} so some pick ups were quickly reshot to give the film a more hard edged real world conclusion rather then the nightmareish endless loop of the American original.=========================================================================[Note: There are two versions, the familiar American version and a British version that runs about 5 minutes longer. The British version includes a longer exposition between David and Dr. Blake and Kelston at the observatory, and the end of the movie is different. Both versions are presented.]We open with title and credits in red font running over a black star field with planets. A narrator (Arthur Franz) tells us, The heavens. Once an object of superstition, awe and fear. Now a vast region for growing knowledge: the distance of Venus, the atmosphere of Mars, the size of Jupiter, and the speed of Mercury. All this and more. We know, but their greatest mystery the heavens have kept a secret. What sort of life, if any, inhabits these other planets? Human life, like ours? Or life extremely lower in scale, or dangerously higher? Seeking the answer to this timeless question, forever seeking, is the constant preoccupation of scientists everywhere. Scientists famous and unknown. Scientists in great universities and in modest homes. Scientists of all ages.David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) set his alarm for 4:00 a.m. to see a rare stellar event. The alarm wakes his father, George MacLean (Leif Erickson). He thinks its time to get up for work, which wakes his wife, Mary (Hillary Brooke). She points out the time, but George correctly assumes his son set his own alarm and goes into check on him. David is at the window with a telescope, and apologizes for waking his Dad. Mary breaks up the party, sending her son back to bed. David falls asleep but is awakened by a thunderstorm at 4:40 a.m. He goes to the window and sees a spaceship on the horizon that appears to land behind the house. He wakes his father and reports, Dad. Dad. Something landed out beyond the trees in the sand pit. A big, bright light. Father and son look out David's window but see nothing. They agree to investigate at morning's light. George puts his robe and slippers on and goes outside to investigate, explaining to Mary, that the work at the plant is secret and they have orders to report anything unusual. George walks up the path along a wooden rail fence that ends in a sand pit. We hear an ethereal, eerie choir of voices and see the sand part leaving a hole that grows larger. George disappears behind a tree and the hole in the sand fills back.The next morning, Mary calls for her husband, George. She too walks up the path to the sand field and hears the strange sound that accompanies a disappearance. She returns to the house and calls the police and talks to the two officers that respond to the call. The older policeman, Blaine (an uncredited Charles Cane) and younger, Jackson (an uncredited Douglas Kennedy) listen to the story, then walk out on the sand to investigate. Jackson spots George's flashlight, and Blaine finds a slipper. Jackson falls into the hole, and when Blaine searches for his partner, he too falls into a hole. The hole disappears. While mother and son talk at the window, George walks back into the house and asks, Any chance for a cup of coffee? George looks a bit disheveled. When questioned, he angrily responds in a tone that is very uncharacteristic, I wish you'd please learn to mind your own business. David asks his father if he saw anything, noticing a scar on the back of his father's neck. When questioned he strikes his son sending him to the floor. The two policemen show up at the house and promise not to report anything. David notices the marks on their necks also. With telescope in hand, David looks at the sand pit and notices a neighborhood girl, Kathy Wilson (Janine Perreau) disappear. Another encounter with his father scares him. He is told, I want to warn you. Don't go spreading stories about things you imagined out in those fields. Understand? Mary, now dressed, joins her husband for a trip to town. George takes her to the sand pit and her fate.David goes to the Wilson home to report Kathy's disappearance. Mrs. Wilson (an uncredited Fay Baker) is incredulous at David's story. Her concern changes from fear to anger when Kathy appears at the door behind David holding a bouquet of flowers. She chastises David for such a cruel hoax. David notices smoke coming from the Wilson basement. A neighbor helps with a hose, but concedes the fire is spreading too rapidly to control. When asked if she was playing in the basement, Kathy lies and denies any involvement, but smiles slyly. David runs to the general store to phone Prof. Kelston at the observatory, but his secretary (an uncredited Barbara Billingsley) tells him Kelston is out and won't be back until later in the afternoon. He stops at a gas station to tell his story to the station attendant, Jim (an uncredited Todd Karns). Jim makes a phone call, but David runs to the local police station and demands to see the Chief. The police desk Sgt. Finlay (an uncredited Walter Sande) listens to David's story as the Police Chief listens from his doorway. Chief Barrows (an uncredited Bert Freed) invites David into his office to talk alone. When Barrows turns to call David's father, David sees the X shaped scar on Barrow's neck. David tries to flee but literally runs into Finlay who stops him and takes him to a detention cell for holding. Barrows goes out to find David's father, while Finlay decides to call Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter). She visits David in his cell. David confides his story after checking her neck for the tell-tale scar. She departs David's cell and asks about the police report on David's father. When told there was none, she asks to use the Chief's phone to call Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz). Mary comes to collect her son. Kelston vouches for David as honest and level headed. Mary takes David to the door of the police station where George is waiting. Before the parents can spirit David away, Dr. Blake orders the boy held and she tells the MacLeans that David may have polio. The parents leave, and Pat takes David into her custody. Pat and David visit Kelston at the Observatory (Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles, California). They speculate on which planet is the most likely to be inhabited. Selecting Mars, Kelston observes that their cities may be underground or they live on space ships.[British Version (About 7 minutes of footage): After they get up from Kelston's desk, he and David explain to Pat where the spaceship could have come from and how. Once Mars is chosen as a likely candidate, David explains to Pat that Mars has oxygen in its atmosphere and water vapor. Kelston concludes, That some form of life exists on Mars. He adds, Its the firm belief of many scientists that the Earth has been under systematic and close range observation for more than 200 years. They review UFO sightings and the various newspaper clippings on sightings. Kelston then pulls out various models of UFO types. Kelston pulls a green, saucer shaped model from the cabinet and David exclaims, That's it! That's exactly what I saw Dr. Kelston. Same shape, color, even the bubble. Kelston volunteers, Our research radar has plotted a ship like this twice in the past six weeks.]They walk up to the telescope to looks at the rocket project and the sand pit. They further speculate that the Martians are here to sabotage the project to protect themselves from us. They witness George MacLean push General Mayberry (an uncredited William Forrest) into the hole. Kelston calls Col. Fielding to report what he saw. Col. Fielding (Morris Ankrum) and his aide, Sgt. Rinaldi (Max Wagner) take the call and jump into action. They call Washington and get orders from the Pentagon Chief of Staff (an uncredited Frank Wilcox) to take charge at the arms plants being threatened. The police have been ordered to arrest those suspected of mind control by the Martians. Tanks and other armament are delivered to the area. David tells his story to Col. Fielding. They talk to the neighbor, Mr. Turner (an uncredited John Eldredge). Pat asks about Kathy's cause of death and is told cerebral hemorrhage. She goes to the hospital for the autopsy.On the roof of the MacLean house, David shows Col. Fielding where everyone disappears. This piques Rinaldi's curiosity and he steals away to investigate on his own. An army unit arrives and Maj. Clary (an uncredited Gil Herman) and Capt. Roth (Milburn Stone) are briefed by the Colonel. Rinaldi is captured by the Martians, but not without a fight. Search lights are placed around the sand pit. Pat returns from the hospital and brings them a crystal and platinum device that was in Kathy's neck. Roth speculates it can be used to track the Martians. Tank battalions arrive and are deployed around the sand pit area. Col. Fielding receives a phone call informing him that the Armstead Plant was destroyed. The two police officers, Blaine and Jackson are surrounded by plant security, but before they can be taken into custody, both collapse and die, the explosive component in the control device in their necks activated by the Martians. At the Rocket facility, Police Chief Barrows and General Mayberry are confronted by the Military Police. They try to escape but are blown up by nitroglycerine they were carrying. Dr. Bill Wilson (an uncredited Robert Shayne) is working late in the lab, mourning the death of his daughter Kathy. Outside the gate, the MacLeans are planning an assassination. While Mary pretends to have car trouble, the guard is distracted long enough for George to knock him out, gain access to the facility and attempt to shoot Dr. Wilson working in his lab. The attempt fails and they are chased by the Military Police. They lose control of their speeding car and crash. They are taken into custody and transferred to the hospital for surgery to remove their implanted devices.The demolitions unit of the army has blown a hole through the sand into a chamber below. Col. Fielding is first in the hole. They conclude that this chamber is no longer active and has been sealed off from the rest of the tunnel system. They retreat back to the surface, where Capt. Roth has completed his detection device to locate the Martians. He starts his search. A call for Dr. Blake informs her that David's parents are in the hospital and ready for surgery. She takes David for a walk to inform him of his parents. As they talk they hear the eerie choir of voices sound that always presages the abduction of humans by the Martians. The pair fall into the hole. Kelston sees this and alerts Roth and Fielding. Towering over the dazed pair are huge, green clad mutants. Two body guard mutants carry the Martian Intelligence (an uncredited Luce Potter) and place it on a pedestal. The Intelligence is encased in a clear glass sphere. It has an oversized skull, human looking face, but the body is just a partial chest with branching, fork-like appendages that move like octopus arms. David and Pat are carried back to the Martian ship through the tunnels the Martian mutants created with an Infrared Ray gun that melts and fuses rock with ease. On the surface, Roth explains, There's nothing here Colonel. They've already gone. Inside the ship David and Pat are presented to the Intelligence. Roth has located the source of the signal and a charge is set to gain access to the tunnel outside the ship. Sgt. Rinaldi, under mind-control, questions the pair. A mutant places Dr. Blake on the table that installs the mind control device. She is rendered unconscious by a light ray, then turned over exposing her neck. Rinaldi carries David back into the tunnels as the troops invade the ship. David cries for help allowing Fielding to track him in the tunnels. The Intelligence marshals his mutant force to attack the human troops. Dr. Kelston rescues Pat from the operating table just before the mind control device is inserted. The Martian ship activates for departure. Demolition charges are installed and set for six minutes. The troops exit the ship and destroy the tunnel leading to the ship's entrance. Unfortunately, their exit to the surface has been blocked and they can't go back and delay or defuse the bomb on the Martian ship. The troops rescue David and take Rinaldi captive. David assists the troops on using the IR Tunnel Gun to get back through the chamber to the exit to the surface.Back on the surface they run for safety. The ship pushes its way to the surface as the bomb ticks down to the final seconds until detonation. As David runs to safety a montage of earlier scenes flashes before us. The bomb goes off destroying the ship as David wakes in his bed from the sound of thunder in the distance. He runs to his parent's room. They are there, perfectly normal and he is told it was all just a nightmare. He is put back to bed, but again sees the Martian ship crash land in the sand pit. We close with the star field and closing theme.[British Version: We see everyone running from the sand pit area. Kelston and Pat Blake take shelter behind a tank. David runs towards them, falls, and is helped to his feet by Kelston and Blake. They embrace and watch as the Martian ship gets airborne. It blows up and the flash of light is shown on the three still huddled behind the tank. The subsequent blast wave knocks down a tree behind them. Pat reassures David, With the control point destroyed, nothing can possibly happen to your mother and father now. They are going to be all right. Acting as surrogate parents, they bid David good night from his bedroom door. The little man has had a busy day, remarks Pat as David sleeps. We close with a flash of lightening over the sand pit, then the star field and closing theme.]

title: The One-Nighter
synopsis: Ever wake up with someone you've never met? It's awkward. You don't know where you are or how you got there? Has that ever happened to you? Your wallet, keys and cell phone have been stolen. You're locked in a crappy apartment on the 16Th floor of a high rise in Newark and the only person who can hear you scream for help is Pixie, the ex-hooker next door who's pissed at you because she's trying to give her boyfriend, Louie, the 'Pixie L'Amour Hula Special.' That's what happens to Chad, a body building underwear salesman from Brazil who loves every inch of himself and Annie, a Catholic kindergarten teacher from Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrows.Pixie's not having a great day either. Once, she was the highest paid hooker in Newark but she gave up all her other tricks when Louie said he was going to divorce his wife and they would be together. That was 32 years ago today and she's beginning to think he's never going to leave her. Louie has been seeing her every Wednesday morning from nine to eleven, except during Lent. He gives her up for Lent.Meanwhile, Zander, the guy who locked Chad and Annie in his apartment, shows up, says he's a cab driver and they stiffed him for his fare last night and he's not going to let them out until he gets his money. Annie signs a check for him because she has an entire kindergarten waiting for her not to mention a nun the kids call Sister Quasimodo. Chad gives him his ATM code because he has a meeting for a $3 million account for men's fiber filled shorts. Zander leaves to get his money.Louie agrees to let Pixie give him her hula special but he wants to do it on the clothes dryer. He likes the vibration. Louie gets up on the dryer. Pixie gets up on the washer but when Louie twists around to turn the dryer on, his back goes out. He can't move. He screams in agony. Pixie says she'll call 9-1-1! Louie screams even louder. 'No 911! No 911!' 'Why Not? They'll take you to the hospital!' 'And Medusa will find out about us! She'll skin me alive. She'll take every dime I've got and make me pay alimony until I'm dead!' 'That'll be better than dying right here on the dryer!' Louie writhes in pain, 'It's not my heart. I'm not going to die right here on the dryer. Ya got any drugs?' Pixie thinks back, 'Yeah. I got Maui Wowie.' She whips out her plastic bag of stash -- dated 1986. Louie whines, 'We're gonna smoke dope from the last century?' Meanwhile, Bubbles, Zander's girlfriend who is not too bright, knocks on Zander's door, 'Sugar Buns? Let me in. I forgot my keys at work.' Annie answers, 'I can't let you in. Zander's got these locks that won't open from the inside. ' Bubbles answers, 'Oh, yeah. Why does he have those crazy locks on there?' 'I don't know. I'm asking you.' 'What are you doing in my boyfriends apartment?' 'I don't know. I woke up in here and I couldn't get out.' When Bubbles finds out that Zander brought Annie and a man home with him, her mind boggles with the possibilities. 'I'm going to kill him.' She storms off.
Meanwhile, Louie and Pixie light up and choke their brains out on the twenty-five -year-old weed.Then Annie and Chad begin to remember last night. They lie down on the bed; Annie looks deeply into his eyes, 'Chad? Was I any good?' 'You were very pleasant.' 'What should I do to improve?' 'Moving would help.' Zander pounds on the door with his gun. 'Excuse me, folks. I'm back.'Louie, stoned out of his mind, asks Pixie if she's ready to give him 'The Pixie L'Amour Hula Special.' Equally buzzed, she manages to get up on her knees on top of the washer and crawl over to him.' We hear a crack. She screams. Louie asks, 'What is it? Is it your back?' 'No! It's my hip! We gotta get to the phone. I don't care if Medusa finds out. But Louie still can't move and she can't move. Now they're the ones screaming for help. What a way to start the day.We follow our six characters as they bob and weave through the labarynth of love always going somewhere one would never expect and just when it seems nothing is going to work out, everything changes one night in Newark.

title: Mad Monster Party?
synopsis: NOTE: All voices by Allen Swift, except where noted.Baron von Frankenstein [voice of Boris Karloff], the scientist who discovered the secret to creation, has just perfected the secret to destruction. In order to celebrate his discovery, the baron invites all his monster friends -- Dracula, the Werewolf, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame -- to his Caribbean Island of Evil for a big party. The baron also has another reason for hosting such a gala. He has decided to retire as head of Monsters Incorporated and to pass on his secrets to his only living heir -- geeky, allergy-ridden pharmacist Felix Flankin, son of the baron's sister, the white sheep of the family. As the SS Herring bearing all the guests nears the island, the baron briefs his zombies about the necessity of remaining calm and collected no matter what happens. Only Yetch is having trouble keeping his head (and hands) attached. This is partly because it's been so long since Yetch has seen all their friends, but also because he is besotted with the baron's secretary, the lovely, well-stacked, red-headed, cool-as-a-cucumber Francesca [Gale Garnet].As the baron and Francesca prepare to greet their guests, they are joined by Frankenstein's Monster and his Mate [Phyllis Diller]. First to arrive is Dracula, who is enchanted to see Francesca. (You have always been my type...O-negative, isn't it?) Next is the Werewolf. (Wolfie, you old dog! This convention is going to be a howling success!) The Invisible Man arrives. (You're looking well...I think.) The Hunchback carries in the Mummy, then comes Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, followed by the Creature. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Chef Mafia Machiavelli is preparing the menu for the party. There's octopus soup and a poison ivy salad with toadstools, poison berries, and three kinds of dressings -- arsenic, cyanide, and nitroglycerin. The antipasto consists of black widows marinated in their own poison, smoked lizards and snakes, and marinated mice. For the main course, there is boar's head, roasted vulture, and minced hyena casserole. In addition, entertainment is to be provided by Little Tibia and the Fibulas. As the dinner commences, the guests are all trying to figure out who will be the baron's successor. Dracula is assured that there is no one more evil, treacherous, and sneaky than he. Francesca thinks she might be able to use Dracula in order to attain the secrets for herself. The Monster and his Mate feel there can be no one closer to the baron than themselves (He CREATED us!). Ultimately, a big fight breaks out, and the guests spend the rest of the night trying to sleep it off.The next morning, the baron's nephew Felix arrives. The baron's plan is to have Francesca show Felix around the island. Francesca's plan is to set Felix up for an ambush along the way. Fortunately, Felix bumbles himself from Dracula, the Mummy, and the Werewolf and all attempts to knock him off. Feeling betrayed by Dracula, Francesca concocts a new plan which involves inviting the diabolical IT to the island. In an attempt to escape from the wrath of the other monsters, however, Francesca finds herself falling in love with Felix. As the two lovers make their way to the opposite side of the island where Francesca has a boat hidden, they are followed by the monsters who have decided unanimously to kill Felix. Just as the monsters capture Francesca and catch up with Felix, IT (King Kong) arrives. IT storms the castle, but when he finds a photo of Francesca, he falls madly in love with her. Grabbing Francesca in his oversized palm, IT climbs to the highest mountain where he is swarmed by airplanes flown by Baron von Frankenstein and his zombies. In his final act, the baron drops the vial of destruction, and the island blows up. Safe at sea, Felix makes plans to marry Francesca, but Francesca reveals that she cannot marry him because she is really only a machine fashioned by the baron. Felix consoles her. Don't worry, Francesca. None of us is perfect...is perfect...is perfect...is perfect...is perfect. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]

title: If These Walls Could Talk
synopsis: Warning: some details may be disturbing.If These Walls Could Talk is a made-for-HBO movie consisting of three segments, set in different time periods, with different characters--in the same house. Each segment focuses on a character facing an unexpected pregnancy, and how each character deals with the situation.The opening credits show various clips of news reports, interviews, protests, rallies and newspaper headlines regarding abortion. We see picket signs and hear comments from both sides of the issue. We hear a news anchor announcing the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, amid clips of people cheering and a sign reading Thank You Supreme Court. We also see a few commercial clips from the 50s, just married couples, a few family shots, among others.The first segment begins with a shot of the front of a house in the process of being painted, and the year 1952 is shown. Down the street, we see a nurse, Claire (Demi Moore) exiting a city bus, coming home from work after a night shift.After she enters her home, we see various photos, giving us a silent introduction to her and her life: pictures of her and her husband, pictures of them with his family, their wedding picture, his military picture, and finally, an in memory of card with her husband's picture. Claire walks about, closing the drapes in the front windows. Next, we see her sitting in a chair, deep in thought and obviously distressed.We then see Claire at work at the hospital, heading toward one of the doctors to speak to him in his office. Apparently he informed her of her pregnancy; she tells him she's been in shock since they spoke but that she's thought about it and knows what she needs to do--and needs his help and information.The doctor replies that she's putting him in an awkward position; he's known her in-laws for a long time. She says that she's thinking of them too, as they're all the family she has. She then asks the doctor to prescribe something for her; I know there are things I could take, I just don't know the dosages.The doctor says he can't do that; it's illegal to terminate a pregnancy. He offers to give her the number of a home that can take care of the adoption and give her a place to stay. She says that's impossible, how can she go away for seven months? What would she tell everyone? The doctor says he doesn't know, and tells her one should think of that before one puts herself in this situation.We then see Claire sitting at home reading books on pregnancy and looking for information on abortion. Next, we see her rummaging through her medicine cabinet, and finding a bottle of prescription medicine. She pops several pills into her mouth and chases them with a glass of hard liquor.Afterwards, we see her vomiting in her bathroom, and we hear a knock at the door: Claires sister-in-law Becky. Claire grabs the pill bottle, wraps it in toilet paper and tosses it in the bathroom trash can.Becky is in the kitchen, carrying a toddler and washing Claires dishes. Claire enters and says she doesn't have to do that. Becky, who we see is about 6 months pregnant, apologizes for waking Claire, and Claire says she's just sick. She says hi to the baby, and Becky tells Claire no offense, but it's probably contagious and she doesn't need a sick baby. Becky said her mom wanted her to bring her some chicken soup, a hot water bottle, and Becky brought her some magazines. Claire says that Becky's mom does too much for her. Becky says you know how she is but to let her help--that by doing for Claire, she feels that she hasn't completely lost Steven (Claire's late husband.)Becky prepares to leave, and as Claire stands at her front door a mutual friend stops to speak to them. After Becky leaves, Claire calls Louise to come to the door. She does, and Claire says she has a friend with three kids at home, one in the hospital, and just found out she's pregnant and is overwhelmed. Claire asks if she knows anyone who can do something. Louise says she doesn't, but figures she could ask around. She then says she's heard rumors about an old, big house in an area of abandoned houses--that her friend would have to be desperate. She suggests Claire ask at the hospital; someone there should know of a better place.We see Claire enter the nurses lounge, and speak to Nurse Jenny Ford about a patient--then she tells her about her friend who's pregnant and that she can't have the baby. Nurse Jenny asks what she wants from her; Claire says she'd hoped they could help her, and she heard theres someone in ER... Nurse Jenny is obviously offended. Claire apologizes, that she didn't know who to ask and she knew Nurse Jenny worked there the longest. Nurse Jenny says she'd like to keep working there--2 nurses were recently dismissed. As they are leaving the break room, Claire asks what she should tell her friend, and Nurse Jenny says she doesn't know--but don't ask her anymore.Next, Claire is in a cab looking for the big house Louise told her about. We see house after house, trashed and boarded up, and then the big house with a light on upstairs. Claire looks, and sees someone turn off the light--and is obviously turned off by the scene. The cab driver says he doesn't know what shes doing here, but he can wait (we get the sense he's taken women there before.) Claire says its OK, she made a mistake.Then we see Claire about to go to her in-laws for Thanksgiving, pinning her too-tight skirt and trying to zip it. She gives up and wears her shirt untucked. We then see the family finishing dinner, Claire serving everyone pie, then saying she has to leave to work that night. Becky offers to take her home, but Claire says the kids are tired, she'll just walk. The family objects and says Kevin (Steven's young brother) will take her home. We see that he's not comfortable with the idea.Before she leaves, Claire's mother-in-law says she's worried about her, and she's working too hard. Claire assures her she's fine. Mother-in-law says she doesn't want Claire to worry about money because they want to be able to take care of her--that they're still family.As Kevin takes Claire home, we sense uneasiness between the two. At home, she thanks him and starts to get out, but he stops her--becoming emotional and apologizing. During the conversation, we see flashbacks of Kevin confronting Claire about her drinking, Claire becoming upset, Kevin comforting her and then the two beginning to kiss--showing how she got into her situation. She says it's not his fault, she knows he didn't mean to hurt her, but he has to forget about it--It never happened.Next, Claire is at work charting when Nurse Jenny hands her a piece of paper with a name and phone number, telling her to give Jenny's name. Claire thanks her, and we see that Nurse Jenny knows its Claire who wants the abortion.Claire calls the woman, Audrey, telling her how she got her number and why she's calling. Audrey says it's a woman in Puerto Rico--and the place is clean, but it will cost about $1000. Claire becomes upset, saying she doesn't have that kind of money. Audrey says this is the only one she would trust; but, hearing Claire upset, tells her she'll try to find someone closer--but she can't promise anything.We see Claire looking for and then finding a knitting needle, and then in her bathroom attempting to do the abortion herself. She injures herself; at that moment Becky knocks on the door and enters. She hears Claire sobbing, and finds her in the bathroom. She asks what's wrong, follows her to the bedroom and Claire reluctantly tells Becky she's pregnant. Becky assumes Claire was raped and asked who did this to her. Claire says she can't tell her, but confides that she was lonely, hurting, and didn't mean for it to happen--and that she's very sorry. Becky is shocked, saying her brother's been dead 6 months (as if Claire was supposed to be over it.) She says everyone knows us; you have to have this baby somewhere else. Claire says she can't have the baby, she needs an abortion. Becky asks how could she do this, then takes her child and before she leaves, says if her mother finds out it will kill her, so she doesn't give a damn what Claire does--and how dare Claire shame us like this.Later, Audrey calls Claire to tell her she found someone named Tom who comes to your house. She said it seems safer, and Claire asks for his number. Audrey says you can't call him, he'll call you and needs Claire's name and work number. Claire asks why, and Audrey assures her he'll be discreet but he needs to be able to reach her, and says he wants $400.We then see Claire at work, reacting to the nurse's station phone ringing when the call isn't for her. When Tom does call, he says he needs the $400 cash in full, asks for her address, tells her what items to have, and that he'll be there at 8:00 the next night. That night, Claire sits in her dining room, counting the money and waiting for Tom. He arrives, asks for the money, and she says he'll get it when its done. He turns to leave, saying he doesn't have time for games. She goes after him, saying come back, I'll give it to you, handing him the money.They enter her house and then the kitchen. He tells her to take off her underwear, and lie down on the table. As she does, she sees him getting out his instruments. She asks if he's going to disinfect them, to which he says they're fine. She says she doesn't want an infection, and he asks do you want to do this or not? She says yes, and he says OK, lets do it--lie down. He inserts the speculum, and as he begins she yells out in pain. He tells her several times not to move, the more you move the more it'll hurt. She tries to be still but is obviously in pain. Finally he says alright, that's it. He wipes off and puts away his instruments, tells her she'll have some cramping and bleeding. He says if she starts to hemorrhage, call the hospital. She asks if she's OK, getting no answer and only hearing the kitchen door and then her front door slam. She lies on the table a moment, holding her stomach and still in discomfort.Finally, we see Claire standing but hanging on to a kitchen counter, calling the hospital--I need your help. Blood is all over the floor and between her legs. We hear the woman on the phone ask for her address. Claire becomes disoriented, falls to her knees and drops the phone. The woman on the phone says they can't send an ambulance without the address, and saying hello. The scene fades.We see the front of the house again, the camera moving in on the upstairs window and back, with a different appearance of the house. A caption reads 1974.In this segment, a new family lives in the house and there is no connection (other than the house) or mention of the previous characters. The segment begins with an early to mid 40-something woman (Sissy Spacek) at her kitchen table, writing, waiting for the toaster, and watching the clock. We see her children, two about middle-school age and two high-school age, getting up and ready for school. Then, we see Barbara (Spacek) on the phone asking about her pregnancy test results, and they tell her the test was positive.As she hangs up, her kids come down to eat, and we see that Barbara is shocked but tries to control her emotions. The kids fuss and argue, and then the father comes home from a night shift job. He sees Barbara is upset, and she says they need to talk--later.Barbara runs out the front door to her friend Julia, waiting to pick her up for her college class. Julia sees she's upset, asks what's wrong, and Barbara says she's pregnant--then urges Julia to drive, drive.Julia pulls over, despite Barbara's objection, and says they're going to talk. She asks if John knows; Barbara says no, she just found out. Julia says she knows it's a shock, and knows what she's going through. We find out Julia has had an abortion when Barbara simply asks, Do you regret it? Julia says no, even though her friends said she'd be depressed and feel guilty--she was so relieved. She points out that not everybody's the same.Barbara checks out Our Bodies, Ourselves in the library and then talks to her professor about the topic for her paper. She wants to find out how a woman writer, with children, has time to write and balance their lives. Her professor encourages her.Later, we see Barbara reading about abortion in the book she checked out. We then hear her oldest daughter, Linda, behind her saying that's a good book. Barbara says casually, oh, you've read it? Linda says she owns it.Barbara starts putting groceries away, and as Linda starts helping her, tells her she can get one at a health clinic. Mom pretends she doesn't know what she's talking about. Linda says It's your legal right. When mom still plays ignorance, Linda says she saw her reading about abortion, then asks if she's going to get one. Mom says she's not ready to talk about it, but thanks her for the information.Later that evening, from the kitchen, we hear oldest brother's band rehearsing in the garage. John comes down after sleeping, and after getting the kids out for a moment alone, Barbara tells him she's pregnant. John is surprised as well. They don't get much chance to talk with the kids arguing and some of them in/out of the kitchen.We then see Barbara and John in their room, discussing the news. John expresses that its done and we'll just have to figure it out. Barbara doesn't express the same sentiment, saying she thought she was through having kids and objecting to John's statement that her degree will have to wait and everyone else has to make sacrifices--him not getting to retire early, Linda not getting to go to the expensive school, instead going to state college. We see a shot of Linda overhearing, with a friend visiting, and slamming her door. John keeps asking what else she wants to do, what is she saying is the alternative? Barbara keeps saying she doesn't know. A look on John's face appears that he may be wondering if she's considering abortion, but it doesn't come up.After John leaves for work, Linda races downstairs to tell mom shes not giving up going away to college just because you guys screwed up. Mom says she doesn't want her to give that up, that nothing is decided yet, and she doesn't want everyone in the house to know about this until they've decided what to do. Linda, caught up in the women's lib movement in full swing at that time, sees the newly legalized abortion as a simple solution to mom's problem. She doesn't understand why mom isn't jumping at the opportunity. She tells mom to be a martyr but she's not going to pay for mom's mistakes.Next, Barbara is telling Julia how Linda reacted, and Julia says her daughter calls her a martyr too. Barbara says after all I do for her, listing a few. Julia says that's a martyr. Barbara disagrees, but Julia says to listen to herself--they're both one; and self sacrifice, unconditional love is BS. They expect gratitude for what they do.Later, after Barbara reads a book on a past woman poet, she calls the local clinic to ask for information on abortion. Then, she enters her daughters' room while Linda is on the phone. Barbara tells her to get off the phone so they can talk. She tells Linda that she's still going away to college. Linda tells mom she doesn't think mom wants to have this baby, and asks if the baby would have a good life if the mother resents it being there. Mom says she's exaggerating how she feels, to which Linda says she doesn't think she knows how she feels. She says we know how dad feels, how Linda feels, but that mom isn't giving herself the right to her opinion. Mom says she has her opinions, but doesn't feel the need to shout it out to the whole world.We then see Barbara telling her professor that she discovered all the women poets didn't balance anything--their lives were a mess. Her professor tells her don't give up, maybe you can make something of what you found. We then see her watching a group of college kids on the lawn, one strumming a guitar, as she's in thought.Next, she's in the kitchen helping her youngest son with his homework, sees younger daughter and oldest son talking and not arguing, and Linda outside being kissed by a boyfriend--which brings a few tears to mom's eyes. John comes in to say good night, preparing to leave for work.Finally, mom comes into Linda's room and tells her what she's decided--she's going to have the baby. Linda is obviously disappointed, and mom says it's the only decision she can live with. Linda gives a light smile and a that's great--really. Mom says she knows everything seems simple when you're young. She then goes over to hug her daughter, and says not to worry, it's what she wants--it'll be OK. The camera moves away from them and the segment ends.Once again we see a shot of the house front, camera moves in and back, the house's appearance again changed, and the year 1996 is shown.This time, the house is occupied by several college students. We see them coming and going, music blaring, a yard sale next door, and a young girl (Anne Heche, Christine) talking to a man (Craig T. Nelson) in a jeep. We learn that she's an architecture student and he's her professor. He's telling her she left so quickly she forgot her blueprints, and compliments her on her work. Chris smiles at him with the school-girl crush look, and he shatters her feelings by handing her an envelope with cash inside. He asks her what she expected, what did she think would happen--to which she replies, That you cared--I expected that you cared about me. He says he does care, and then I'm late, I have to go. Chris tells him sarcastically not to let her keep him.She heads inside, past a guy who tells her there's a party that night. She says she never misses a party. We then see a TV with a talk show on, with arguing and words bleeped out--further illustrating how different times are compared to the first two segments. Chris' roommate, Patti, (Jada Pinkett) asks how the girl on TV talks to her mother like that, and cheers when a man in the audience says he wouldn't talk to his mother like that.Christine comes in, and the girls are living in what appears to be the house's attic. It takes a moment for Patti to notice Chris, then she finally turns off the TV and tells Chris her mom called, telling her a few things Chris' mom said. Patti then says she went to a bookstore that day and found the best books on pregnancy, diet, etc. Chris gives a sarcastic Yay, to which Patti asks what is wrong. Chris said that she'd just seen Jim, and that he basically said See ya--wouldn't want to be ya, then gave her money. Patti says she'd really like to know what he thinks she's going to do with that. Chris asks what Patti thinks he expects, and then says maybe he's right.Patti asks what Chris means by that, that Chris doesn't even believe in abortion. Chris says OK, shes a hypocrite and a coward, but she can't go through with this. Patti says so you've decided to kill your baby?? Chris asks why this is so important to her, to which Patti replies that this isn't--she is. They'd been friends 8 ½ years we hear, and Patti says I know you--if you get this abortion, you won't be able to live with yourself. Please think about what you're doing. Chris replies, Think about it? Im 10 weeks already! How long you want me to think? Patti finally tells her if she gets an abortion, she's on her own, and walks away.Next, Chris is riding her bike down a street and we hear a group of women praying the Hail Mary in front of an abortion clinic. Christine gets off her bike, starts toward the clinic, when one of the women stops her, asks her name, and says, You're not going in there to get an abortion, are you? The woman's daughter, Doreen, approaches carrying a baby and tells Chris to just hear her out a minute. She says she has four kids, and that she's not rich or a supermom, but she's grateful for God's gifts to her--her children. She says maybe you're not married, but your baby shouldn't have to pay for that. Chris tries to walk away, and Doreen tells her to just wait--when she has her baby and holds him/her in her arms, the love and maternal instinct just takes over. Then a clinic escort, Francis, approaches and asks what happens to the mothers who beat, abandon, or murder their kids because they didn't want them in the first place. Their maternal instinct just didn't click in like Doreen's. The protesters try to stop Chris, saying they can help her financially, but Chris continues inside.Inside, Chris is given paperwork to fill out and read. We see her getting her vitals taken, blood drawn, and finally talking to a counselor, Marcia (Diana Scarwid) who says she's not clear if Chris wants to be there, or if someone's pressuring her. Chris replies that she wants to be there but doesn't, and is just confused. The counselor is understanding, and goes over options with her. Chris asks about the women outside saying they can help with expenses. The counselor says they have been able to help some women, with baby supplies and a place to live temporarily. The counselor asks if Chris has tried to talk to her parents; Chris says they're really strict Catholics; she's one of five kids and considered the good kid. The counselor asks about the relationship that caused the pregnancy. Chris explains that situation, and goes on that it isn't fair that he gets to go about his life and she's there, making this decision. She then expresses concern about the baby being ripped out of me and asks if it can feel it, as she's been told. The counselor assures her that even though the people outside are saying that, she's asked this of the medical workers she trusts and that it is not true--a first trimester abortion is painless to the embryo. Chris says this is hard, and the counselor empathizes--and says she's there to help her be clear on her decision.Outside, we see the women singing and Chris exiting, telling Francis she couldn't go through with it. Francis tells her it's OK, to take her time and think about it. The women tell Chris they'll pray for her, and Chris says she didn't do it. The women stand and join hands in a rejoicing prayer, and Doreen writes a number down for Chris to call them--which Chris snatches out of her hand. We see the clinic doctor (Cher) leaving and asking Doreen how her baby's doing, and Doreen's mother politely says Good afternoon, Doctor.We see Chris in the bathtub, talking to her mother on the phone. They have a decent conversation, but at one point it seems Chris wants to tell her she's pregnant--but then tells mom to go ahead and get her door, she'll talk to her later.Later, Chris is walking about, a party at the house in full swing. She sees Patti, who looks away. Chris continues about, talking to a guy and obviously impaired. She finally heads upstairs, plops down, and is startled by Patti turning on a light. Chris says she noticed while in the bathtub she looks pregnant--that she looks pregnant because she chickened out, but she's going back tomorrow. Patti angrily asks why Chris is telling her this. Chris says to excuse her for being confused--she's not always right--she doesn't always have the right answer. Patti tells her that's BS, she knows what to do; she just wont accept it. Chris tells her that's right, that's right girlfriend--I'm so screwed! Chris gets up and sits in a chair, and starts crying. She tells Patti she made a mistake--one hell of a big mistake. She asks if her friend, her f'ing best friend, can forgive her for making a mistake; as she sobs heavily Patti keeps giving Chris a dirty look. Finally, Patti gets up, hands Chris a tissue and sits down to hug her. Chris asks if Patti could help her, if she can for once throw her morals away and help her. Patti tells her it's cool, she'll be there for her.Patti and Chris pull up to the clinic, to the sound of sirens and a large crowd of protesters. Patti says this looks too intense and says maybe they should come back tomorrow. Chris says she can't, she just wants to get it over with. They make their way through the crowd, and the women who saw her the day before asks why she's back there, they talked about this yesterday. They try to no avail to stop her; Francis and another woman help Chris and Patti inside. A man yells to Chris that if she gets an abortion, she's still a mother--just a mother of a dead baby.They make it inside, a couple is helped inside with the girl hysterical, and the staff is talking about how bad it is outside. As Chris is taken to a room for the abortion, we see Dr. Thompson trying to pull in and protesters surrounding her vehicle, yelling at her. Chris watches from a window inside. Marcia, the counselor, is there and tells her Dr. Thompson flies twice a week to a clinic that always has picketers. Dr. Thompson is later inside a room, taking off a bullet-proof vest, sitting and trying to gather her emotions before starting.We see the outside/inside scenes back and forth; a group sitting singing Jesus loves the little children, other people yelling, holding signs and picketing. A woman staff member says the people are crazy, to which Patti, behind her says they're not--that one man might be a little radical but their overall concept is right. The woman asks what she's doing in there.We then see Dr. Thompson enter and introduce herself, listens to Christine's heart, and tells her to lie back. Chris tells her she's nervous, to which the doctor says its OK, it's perfectly normal. As Chris lies down, she asks the doctor with all she has to deal with, why does she still do this? The doctor says she remembers what it was like when it was illegal for women to make this decision and doesn't want to see those days come again--and when a woman tells her she doesn't know what she would have done without her help, she knows she's doing the right job. Dr. Thompson prepares to begin the procedure, and explains to Chris everything as she goes along.We see Patti and the staff member talking again, and Shameeka asks Patti if she thinks the 12-year-old in there last week should've had the baby. Patti says she could've given it up for adoption, to which Shameeka says yeah, right girlfriend. She tells Patti she's living in a fantasy world, because she was just thinking what a big demand there was for black babies.As Chris is prepped, the counselor talks to her, asking about school--we see the outside scenes still alternate with inside--and Marcia tells Chris she's going to hear a suction machine, which we then hear. Chris is silent, staring at the ceiling and crying softly.We see Shameeka and Patti again; Shameeka says she sees this all the time--you people come in, get your abortion, and the next day back out there on the line. The clinic administrator passes, hears this, and reprimands Shameeka that this is inappropriate conversation in there. The administrator is then bumped into by a nervous young man who we saw earlier with his hysterical girlfriend. He apologizes, saying he was just looking for the restroom.Back to Chris; the doctor tells her its almost over. We see a large swab covered in blood, which Chris sees and looks away with disgust. The doctor tells her it's all done, she came through like a trooper, and Chris sighs with relief.Suddenly, the door bursts open, and there stands the young boy seen earlier. He aims a gun at the doctor, yells Murderer! and begins shooting at the doctor. Chris and Marcia scream, and a bloodied Dr. Thompson falls to the floor. The boy, aiming the gun at Chris, asks if he shot her; he didn't mean to. He puts the gun on the floor, again apologizing to Chris and saying he didn't mean to hurt her. He leaves the room; Marcia gets up from the floor, sounds an alarm and as she runs from the room, yells that the doctor's been shot.Chris gets down from the table, down onto the floor, and helps a still (but barely) alive Dr. Thompson turn over. Dr. Thompson smiles lightly at Chris. The camera backs away, in a view from the ceiling, blood spreading about the floor. Chris cradles Dr. Thompson and yells Somebody! Help! The segment ends and credits roll in front of the 1996 view of the house.

title: Avril et le monde truqué
synopsis: In Paris in 1870, an event splits the timeline from the one we're familiar with. Napoleon III, preparing for war with Prussia, has tasked a scientist with developing a drug -- dubbed the ultimate serum -- that will make his soldiers indestructible, able to recover almost instantly from wounds and disease. The emperor visits Professor Gustave Franklin's lab to gauge his progress. Franklin has a couple of creatures in a murky test chamber; he calls them Rodrigue (French voice: Benoît Brière; English voice: J.K. Simmons) and Chimène (French voice: Anne Coesens; English voice: Susan Sarandon). (Rodrigue and Chimène are named for characters from legends based on the life of the Spanish hero El Cid -- comparable to Romeo and Juliet.) We can't see the test subjects, but we hear them say a few words. When Franklin reports that he hasn't yet identified the right formula for the ultimate serum, the emperor loses his temper and orders his henchman to shoot Rodrigue and Chimène, without waiting to hear what Franklin urgently wants to tell him. The movie's timeline diverges from our own when the test subjects escape -- we never get a good look at them, but they seem to be four-legged and low to the ground -- and the ensuing explosion kills Franklin and Napoleon III.The immediate result is positive: Napoleon IV signs a peace treaty that averts the Franco-Prussian War, which didn't go well for France and is generally considered to have set the stage for World War I. Before long, though, scientists and inventors start to disappear. Technologies they would have developed -- notably radio, electricity, and petroleum-powered internal combustion and diesel engines -- never appear. Europe uses up its coal to power its steam engines, then consumes its forests. When the story resumes in 1931, France is planning to invade North America for its trees. The French government requires all remaining scientists to work for the state; their priority is to develop new weapons for the coming North American war.The descendants of Professor Franklin are renegades. His son Prosper (French voice: Jean Rochefort; English voice: Tony Robinow), now an old man who wants his family to call him Pops, has continued the search for the ultimate serum in secret. Prosper's son Paul (French voice: Olivier Gourmet; English voice: Mark Camacho) and Paul's wife Annette (French and English voices: Macha Grenon) are in it with him; even their young daughter April tries to help. When we first see Prosper, he's in a conservatory visiting a tree. When Paul comes to bring him back to work, Prosper says he's drawn to the tree and can't help coming every day.The Franklins are distilling the latest version of the ultimate serum when the gendarmes -- police -- break in on them, lead by Inspector Gaspar Pizoni (French voice: Bouli Lanners; English voice: Paul Giamatti). Annette hides the serum by injecting it into April's snowglobe and the family flees, Prosper in a steam-powered car and April, her parents, and her talking cat Darwin (French voice: Philippe Katerine; English voice: Tony Hale) in a police dirigible. Pops gets away; the rest of the family makes it onto a cable car bound for Germany, but the cops catch up with them before the cable car leaves Paris. The cable car is attacked by a strange dark cloud that strikes the police and April's parents with lightning that seems carefully aimed. April and Darwin escape in a kind of lifeboat just before the cable car explodes. In the aftermath Inspector Pizoni, who survived the explosion with injuries, is demoted to agent for bungling the capture of the Franklins. Paul and Annette are presumed dead, but Pizoni vows to win back his rank by finding Prosper.Ten years later, April (French voice: Marion Cotillard; English voice: Angela Galuppo) and Darwin are living on their own in the head of a huge metal statue of one of the Napoleons. Scientists are still disappearing. April makes her way around Paris stealing things she needs, and is followed by a young man, Julius (French voice: Marc-André Grondin; English voice: Tod Fennell), who is Pizoni's informant. (Pizoni hopes that April will lead them to Prosper.) She doesn't know Julius is following her, but the entrance to the statue is well hidden so he loses track of her. April is still working to perfect the ultimate serum, motivated by the knowledge that her beloved Darwin is dying -- his lungs have been damaged by all the soot in the air, product of decades of burning coal and wood in huge quantities. April reads to him (Puss in Boots, another story about a talking cat) while they wait to see whether her latest formula will cure him. It doesn't, so she goes out again to steal ingredients for the next attempt.A fairground seems promising. One of the booths features a magic show that includes some chemical effects. (And, oddly, a pigeon outfitted to transmit audio and video.) April sneaks backstage during the show and finds what she needs, but the magician's assistant catches her and raises the alarm. April runs, with the magician's assistant in hot pursuit. (In a remote listening post, a shadowy figure orders that a spy rat be sent in.) Luckily for April, Julius has picked up her trail again and has recently been told by Pizoni to shield her from the consequences of stealing -- she can't lead them to Prosper if she's in jail. Grasping her predicament, Julius runs up to April saying Honey, where have you been? I've looked all over for you! and kisses her. This distracts her pursuer so Julius (who has previously exhibited some skill at sleight of hand tricks) can extract the stolen chemicals from her bag. When the magician's assistant looks into her bag, there's nothing incriminating to be found and they get away. April is baffled by Julius's help, seems uninterested in making friends, and ditches him as soon as he returns her chemicals. He follows her, as does a rat wearing the same kind of spy equipment we saw on the pigeon. Julius loses her again near the statue; the rat doesn't.In her lair, watched by the spy rat, April whips up another batch of what she hopes is really the ultimate serum and feeds it to Darwin. Julius, who's hanging around outside feeling frustrated, happens to notice that the statue's eyes -- April's windows -- are lit up. It's gotten dark and she's forgotten to pull down the shades.When it seems Darwin is getting worse instead of better, April loses it. She throws the vial of failed serum, which breaks and drips on the spy rat. She sweeps the distilling apparatus off the table, breaking and throwing things left and right -- including her snow globe, which leaks a little. Darwin slurps up the liquid and goes limp again -- he's almost too weak to move now. Moments later, as April weeps over his impending death, Darwin leaps up and announces that he's cured -- all signs of weakness and coughing are gone. Even his voice sounds stronger. Darwin tells April he drank some of the water from the snow globe, and April realizes her parents must have hidden their final version of the serum there. The mysterious masters of the spy rat see and hear all of this.Suddenly Julius appears at the window -- he's climbed the outside of the statue to find April. She's annoyed but helps him in rather than letting him fall to his death. They're distracted by a voice emanating from the spy rat. It's Paul, April's father, warning that she's in danger -- she should leave right away, go to the oak tree, and wait for Pops. Darwin pounces on the rat, apparently killing it and interrupting the transmission.At the window, Julius notices a strange dark cloud that looks very much like the one that attacked the Franklin's cable car 10 years before. It approaches quickly and starts to cut through the metal of the statue's head. April, Darwin and Julius flee down the stairs to the street and get away.In a control room, people in red coveralls monitor transmissions from all over the world. Their bosses, who seem to be robots or cyborgs -- we don't see them clearly -- discuss what just happened. A female voice says one of the scientists took control of the spy rat; a male voice, calling her my love, replies that she's far too lenient with the humans and this scientist should be punished. The bosses go outside to a cell in the jungle. Its walls are made of red laser beams and inside is April's father Paul. The female voice asks Paul what he said to his daughter -- they want April's help with a project they're working on. Paul just smiles until they confront him with Annette, who looks angry.April, Darwin, and Julius eventually make their way to Julius's hideout, where they spend the night. Julius gives up his bed to April. Julius is a little sweet on her and offers to help, but April is dismayed at being thrown together with him and keeps saying she doesn't need friends, though Darwin reminds her how Julius has already helped them.April puzzles over her father's message, wondering where she can find an oak. Julius knows where to go, noting there's only one tree left in Paris. The next day they find the tree in a large conservatory and sit there for hours before an old man in a gas mask (to protect him from the sooty air) sits nearby and speaks to them. It's Pops. He gives them directions to a safe place but tells them he'll leave first and they should give him an hour's head start. April is impatient and leaves with Julius and Darwin soon after Pops departs.Meanwhile, April's parents are arguing. Annette wants to bring April into their unnamed project; she believes in the project and feels that April will be safer with them. Paul has lost confidence in the project and wants to keep April as far away from it as possible.In a huge hangar or warehouse, April and Julius find a large single-family house with an odd metal tunnel for an entrance. April seems to recognize the house. Pops arrives right behind them and scolds them for coming so quickly; he's afraid they'll be followed. April explains that she's had a message from her father, and hopes that her mother is alive too.The mysterious boss with the feminine voice questions Annette. She's disappointed that Paul wouldn't tell Annette anything, but assures Annette that they won't hurt him.In Pops' study, they're trying to figure out what's going on. Pops decides to go back to the statue to retrieve the spy rat. He won't let April come along, but tells her there are clothes for her upstairs. She discovers a wardrobe full of pink dresses, identical but in different sizes. She puts on one that fits and goes down to ask Julius what he thinks (it's a very different look for her -- she's been wearing boys' clothes up to this point), but can't find him: he's gone off to report to Pizoni. Julius agrees to give up Pops to Pizoni but lies that he doesn't know where April is. At the same time April fools with an untested electrical device Pops was working on; as soon as it powers up, the red-suits in the control center detect it and send a spy rat to pin down its location. Julius comes back in time to be zapped by the device before April manages to rip out its power cable.Pops is checking out the plaza around the statue when Pizoni catches him. Pizoni's very pleased with himself and gives Pops a lump of coal as a memento of their previous meeting, when Pops escaped the police raid by climbing a pile of coal and scrambling up a coal chute. Darwin, who has followed Pops, sees all this and trails them to a meeting with Pizoni's superior officer. The meeting doesn't go as Pizoni hoped. Though his boss is happy to have Prosper, he reminds Pizoni that he was told to stay away from the scientists and has him arrested. In the commotion, Darwin gets Prosper's attention and Prosper tells him In case anything goes wrong, on my world globe, Uruguay! with a U for urgent! Darwin also overhears that Prosper and Pizoni are being sent to Fort-la-Latte.Darwin high-tails it back to the house, where Julius is telling April he has to leave. Before he can get away, Darwin reports that Prosper has been captured and is bound for Fort-la-Latte. At Fort-la-Latte, a research station where many of the French government's captive scientists are working, Pizoni is locked up and Prosper is taken around to look at various research projects. A damaged airplane grabs his attention. It was found wrecked, its origin is unknown, and its technology is unfamiliar to the French scientists. Pops sets to work repairing it. Back at the house, April uses an atlas to locate Fort-la-Latte (a real medieval castle) on the coast of Brittany. The dark cloud attacks the hangar and starts cutting it up to get at the house -- the mysterious bosses have tracked April down.Darwin presses Uruguay on the globe and the house immediately encloses itself in armor, the desk in the study flips over to reveal a control console, and a recording of Pops' voice plays on the Victrola: Dear visitor, if you're hearing this, it's because the situation is critical, so welcome to my metamansion. To steer the metamansion to the location of your choice, type your destination on the keyboard. For any other information, see the user's manual. (A large book pops out of a slot on the console.) A laser from the dark cloud is trying to cut through the metamansion's armor, so April wastes no time in entering Fort La Latte on the control console's keyboard. The house sprouts legs (à la Howl's Moving Castle) and runs off, dodging their pursuers and jumping into the River Seine -- the armor keeps out water as well as lasers, and the metamansion can swim as well as it can run. They head for the coast of Brittany to rescue Pops.The dark cloud that's been after them seems to give up, gaining altitude as it dissipates to reveal that it contains a plane -- or aerocopter -- that looks like the one Pops is trying to repair at Fort-la-Latte. Over the radio, the mysterious bosses discuss April's escape. The female boss calls the male boss, who's flying the aerocopter, Rodrigue.At Fort-la-Latte, Pops explains electricity to the government scientists as he repairs the damaged aerocopter. The area starts to flood because the metamansion has punctured the castle's foundation. April and company sneak in to find Pops, who's having so much fun with the aerocopter that he doesn't hear them calling at first. He gets it working and they all get aboard and escape from Fort-la-Latte as the guards shoot at them. The metamansion is lost.Once they're aloft, Pops explains that they don't know where they are and starts to work on the guidance mechanism while he questions Julius about why Pizoni knew where to find him. Julius admits that he turned Pops in because the alternative was jail. Pops doesn't seem too troubled by this, but April is furious.Pops' tinkering triggers a video and we finally get a good visual of the two mysterious bosses: they're lizards wearing armored, human-shaped suits, with their tails hanging out at waist level. In the video, the female boss says Dear scientists, welcome aboard. We are your new masters, Rodrigue and Chimène. You are being guided to a safe haven where your talents will be appreciated and put to good use, in pleasant surroundings far away from the follies of your government. All science is most valuable to us. Like your cruel species, we have learned that knowledge is power. Your science will help us achieve supreme power through technological superiority. The nature of your work will be explained later.In the control center, the red-suits listen to April's reaction: Lizards? Those lizards took my parents? The bosses take control of the plane and fly it into a tunnel, where it seems to be losing power. Pops goes aft to see what's wrong with the propulsion and discovers a stowaway: Pizoni, who's heard where they're headed and doesn't want to go there, so he's destroying the engines with a crowbar.It's too late. Their momentum carries them out of the tunnel and into a jungle, where the plane crashes. Rodrigue is getting a massage and listening to music when Chimène breaks in to report the crash and suggest that he search the jungle for the wreckage; they expect April and company didn't survive.They're wrong, of course; April and Julius marvel at all the plants and the clean air and argue while Pops and Pizoni are captured almost immediately and confined in a laser-walled cell right next to Paul's. April, Darwin, and Julius find their way into the research station. They dress up in red coveralls and ask another red-suit where Annette and Paul Franklin are, but the guy realizes that anyone he doesn't know is likely to be a spy and calls for help, so they have to run. The lizard guard who shoots at them (one of Rodrigue and Chimène's many children) manages to short out the whole electrical system when he misses, putting everyone in the dark and letting Paul, Pops, and Pizoni out of their cells. Paul and Pops go looking for April, telling Pizoni he can get out through the chimney. (Apparently they're under ground. Pizoni spends the rest of the movie climbing.)Darwin distracts a lizard guard by climbing into its armor so Julius can grab its weapon. Held upside down, the guard tells them Paul is in a cell; they can follow the blue lights to find the holding area. They take off and the guard quickly reports to Rodrigue -- Papa -- that they're headed for Paul's cell and they have the guard's ray gun. Rodrigue (who is frequently advised by Chimène to quell his brutal tendencies) says Chimène, I just had an idea. A nonviolent one! I think you'll like it.Paul and Pops wander the jungle looking for April while April, Julius, and Darwin, who have lost the trail of blue lights, wander aimlessly until they encounter Annette. April is overjoyed; Annette whisks them away and explains that she's working with the world's greatest minds in this technological paradise to complete the project. April wants to know where her father is, why her mother isn't locked up (You escaped, right? You were in a cell, like father? You know how to get him out?), and whether this project has something to do with the ultimate serum. Annette is evasive until they meet Rodrigue and Chimène.April accuses her mother of betraying them; Annette denies it. April, assuming that they want the serum, gives Rodrigue the snowglobe. He smashes it, laughing, and says they want what's inside her head. Chimène and Annette explain that they've recreated the serum in the globe several times and it never worked -- Darwin was cured by April's serum. As proof, Chimène produces the spy rat that Darwin attacked just before they left April's lair in the statue: the rat, which consumed a few drops of April's serum after she broke the vial, is fine now, and can regenerate and survive any attack. Darwin gets very excited: I could be a warrior -- a cat ninja! When April asks how she could have created something like that in her makeshift lab, Rodrigue responds by shooting Darwin in the chest. The cat appears to die but quickly recovers and repeats, Cat ninja! Chimène tells April she's going to recreate her serum for the project. Just then the power comes back on and April, Julius, and Darwin realize they're on a launchpad. There's a rocket covered with vines and vegetation near the cliff wall and a crowd of red-suited scientists nearby.Chimène explains, You see this rocket? It's covered with specimens of plants. It will explode in deep space, scattering billions of spores cultivated in this jungle. Once you've treated them with your serum, the spores will be able to survive the explosion and the interstellar vacuum. They'll spread to new planets where they'll flourish and multiply. Thanks to you, April, life will never end.Julius says Hold on -- you're going to blow up a huge bomb to save life? That's why you need all this science?Chimène and Rodrigue believe that humanity will eventually destroy the world. The purpose of their project is to spread life widely enough that it can't be stamped out. April is angry and says all this doesn't justify stealing her parents and killing all the people on the cable car. Chimène says that was an accident and threatens to let Rodrigue deal with Annette if April doesn't cooperate. April caves and gets to work, with Julius assisting, in a lab set up right on the launchpad. They test her serum on a dead potted plant, which revives, sprouts new leaves, and blooms before their eyes. Rodrigue asks for the serum and Julius hands him a vial.Rodrigue drinks the serum himself (So this is what it feels like to be invincible! I like it!) and announces, over Chimène's protests, that he's lowered the altimeter setting on the bomb to 500 meters; it will destroy all life on the surface of the earth. (Presumably the lizards are safe in their cavern.) These humans will get the fate they deserve! When Chimène protests, Rodrigue attacks and overpowers her, despite Annette's attempt to help Chimène. Rodrigue demands that his children choose between living and ruling with him and dying with their mother. They start shooting.The wounded Chimène tells April the only hope is to get inside the rocket and reset the altimeter to trigger the bomb far out in space. Rodrigue is preparing to kill April when Julius shoots him with his captured ray gun. Idiot! I'm invincible! says Rodrigue, before keeling over. Julius explains that he switched the serum with a vial of water, which is what Rodrigue drank. They realize the rocket is about to take off and April, Julius, and Darwin rush to get aboard. Only Darwin is quick enough. But April is able to throw the vial of serum at the rocket, inoculating the vegetation before lift-off. Paul and Pops appear in an elevator and whisk Annette, April, and Julius away from the launchpad.Meanwhile Darwin, aboard the rocket, tries to reset the altimeter. It's not clear he succeeded until the rocket breaks through the ceiling of the cavern -- it turns out they were beneath Paris all along -- and disappears into the sky. Pizoni emerges from a chimney just in time to see it. He on his rooftop and the Franklins and Julius, who are in a car trying to get as far from the explosion as they can in case Darwin fails, see a bright, distant flash when the rocket explodes without destroying anything.A series of news reports plays out on a TV in a room that changes over time:1941: Napoleon V makes Pizoni head of his secret service.1951: Limitless oil has ended the energy wars; acclaimed biologist April Franklin has failed to make her ultimate serum compatible with the human organism; plant life is observed on the moon, Mars, and Venus.2001: A spaceship from the Democratic Union lands on the moon, which has verdant vegetation, a breathable atmosphere -- and a cat. Darwin says to the camera, What took you so long? April, I'm coming! An elderly Julius leaves the room to tell April that Darwin has been found.

title: Dark Star
synopsis: An incoming message from Earth arrives to the spaceship. Watkins (Miles Watkins) says that the trip is being broadcast live. The messages take around ten years to arrive. There was a radioactive leak, and Commander Powell (Joe Saunders) died. In consequence, there is a week of mourning on Earth, all flags are half-mast, but Congress won't pay for a radiation shield. Dark Star is the spaceship.Talby (Dre Pahich, with the voice of John Carpenter) is one of the astronauts, and he falls asleep. The crew can speak to Bomb 19 (Alan Sheretz's voice), which destroys a planet. Dark Star goes to hyperspace and leaves the hell out of there, watching the explosion from far away. The computer (Cookie Knapp's voice) says that they've destroyed the last unstable planet on that system. However, the computer finds another unstable red-dwarf planet, so they have to go and check it out.Francis Boiler (Cal Kuniholm) puts on some country music on the radio. On the ship's log, we can hear that a part of the ship self-distructed. They are dancing to the sound of funky music. The computer tells about something on collision course, and the defence system was destroyed some time ago, so they try to do something manually. A thunder activates a bomb. Bomb 20 (Adam Beckenbaugh) is deployed, but luckily, the computer overides the orders and Bomb 20 finally goes back to its place. Images of a hole around the destroyed laser machine.Lt. Doolittle (Brian Narelle), Sgt. Pinback (Dan O'Bannon) and Talby go to their room. They sleep in the same place, and it looks like an aparment from the projects in the 60's. One of them makes music with empty bottles of liquor.Talby should be watching the ship, but he's always sleeping. He is advised to see the rest of the ship. He says that space can be wonderful and full of colour, and Doolittle says that he misses Earth and Mars as well. Francis Boiler starts shooting a square of metal just to distract himself, although Pinback tells him not to do it. The computer tells Pinback about the alien going awry, telling him that it was his original idea to bring him into the ship.The alien (Nick Castle) is a beach ball with legs. It doesn't want to eat. Pinback brought it in because he thought it was fine. Pinback is cleaning up the alien's mess when it attacks him. The alien leaves the room. Pinback gives it a plastic toy, and it eats it, but when Pinback goes to pick the broom, the alien is not there. It holds the broom and hits Pinback with it. Pinback looks for the alien in the bowels of the ship. Pinback uses a plank to go to the alien. A sign says Emergency air lock interior room. The alien goes around Pinback and takes the plank away. He tries to cross the shaft, although the corridor is very narrow. It is the lift shaft, and the computer says that it's been activated. Pinback tries to move on towards the alien, but it attacks him. He falls down, but can hold onto the thin layer of passway. The alien jump and tickles Pinback. The lift seems to stop when Pinback interrupts it. The lift goes up again, with Pinback holding onto an outer metalic handle. The alien turns onthe laser, which makes all the systems go crazy.Meanwhile, Doolittle and Talby have kept on talking. Bomb 20 has received a signal to ignate itself again. The computer tries to reason with it, saying that it was an error again. Bomb 20 finally agrees, but it says that that was going to be the last time.The lift stops at the third floor, and Pinback thinks of jumping out. He unscrews a floor trap and gets onto the lift. He gets stuck. He tries to use the phone for help, but it's out of order. He presses another button, and opera music resounds. The lift keeps going up and down for no apparent reason. He presses another button to clean the lift, and presses 1, which will make the lift clean itself.Finally Pinback leaves the lift amid a mist of smoke and with a metalic lid around his waist. Now, at this moment, he's really pissed off, so he goes to pick and anesthetic gun. Soon enough, he finds the alien, cornered somewhere. He shoots the alien, who flies all over the place, and ends up deinflated.Pinback talks about his ordeal to the rest of the crew. They have lunch togethertalking about Talby being mentally unstable. Talby goes to the computer room, and says to Doolittle that the computer has found the malfunction in the ship.Powell left a message, saying that he doesn't intend to come back to Earth. Pinback checks his past diary logs, stating that nobody recognises his good qualities, and that nobody said happy birthday to him. The computer has finally found the malfunction: it's the laser. However, everybody is sound sleeping but for Pinback.Eventually, they find the unstable planet. Bomb 20 is deployed. Pinback is in the emergency air lock, where there is a door which can be opened without depressureization. There, there is the laser who works badly. Nobody wants to hear Pinback, because they are busy with the deployment of Bomb 20. The laser is turned on, and it shoots inside the ship. The laser makes Pinback blind, and he crosses the path of the laserbeams. This creates further malfunctions, so they can't drop the bomb. Everybody panics on the bridge because the explosion sequence goes on, and Bomb 20 refuses to turn itself off.The computer will only contain the damage done to the ship by Bomb 20 up to a certain degree. They have to ask Powell, in the cryogenic deep-freeze compartment, what could be done. Powell asks about the Dodgers, and complains that he's lonely. When he is about to give a suggestion, the mike has a malfunction, and then Powells forgets about it. Pinback tries to reason with Bomb 20 while Doolittle questions Powell. Doolittle goes out to space and talks to Bomb 20.DOOLITTLE: How do you know that you exist.BOMB 20: Intuition.DOOLITTLE: You can't base everything on intuition.BOMB 20: I think, therefore I am.and the dialogue goes on and on like that. Bomb 20 agrees that its experience of the outer world depends on possibly wrong information. It says that it'd be nice to keep on discussing the matter with Doolittle, but that it has no time, because it will go off in 49 seconds. Meanwhle, Boiler tries to shoot the bomb. In the fight with Pinback, he almost shoots him.Doolittle tells Bomb 20 to consider what his purpose in life is. To explode, of course, says Bomb 20. As it can only explode once, it wouldn't like to explode at the wrong time, would it? Of course not, says Bomb 20, but as it had admitted before that it had no proof that the outer world does exist. 9 seconds, says Bomb 20, and my memory is very good. It has no proof that the orders are either wrong or correct. Bomb 20 goes back inside Dark Space to think futher about the matter.Doolittle tries to rescue Tanby, who was shot out of Dark Space. Now, Bomb 20 thinks that no order coming from the outer world can be reliable, so it explodes itself happily although Pinback tries to reason with it. Tanby and Doolittle are left stranded floating in space. Powell goes flying away wrapped in a bath of ice.Doolittle falls to the planet they wanted to destroy, Tangy gets kida trapped in a travelling concusion of lights, so that he'll be travelling through the universe forever. Doolittle uses a piece of debris to surf down to the red planet.---written by KrystelClaire

title: Malice
synopsis: A young college coed is leaving school for the day. She jumps on her bike and heads home. Upon arriving, she calls out to her cat to come for her meal. She spies the cat cowering under a table, growling softly. Just as she comes close to reassure her cat, a mysterious figure comes out from the shadow and violently attacks her.Quick cut to college professor Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) and Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) at the hospital discussing the ongoing problems with campus security. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), the new surgeon at St. Agnes hospital works feverishly to save the girl, even though he is told we're going to lose her. The surgery is successful. In the locker room, Hill tells the surgeon who made the comment that while he wants to make new friends, if he ever says something like that again, he will remove (his) lungs with a f***ing ice cream scoop.Andy and Jed meet to discuss the girl's condition. After a moment, Andy realizes that he knew him from their old high school, Van Buren. They hope to see each other around.Andy goes to see his wife, Tracy Kessinger (Nicole Kidman), at work. As they talk in the elevator, Dr. Hill steps in with a colleague. They are invited to a reception to welcome Jed to the hospital. They politely decline and leave. As they walk along the street, they talk about the new plumbing for their Victorian house will cost them $14,000. Tracy suggests renting out the third floor to a tenant, but Andy refuses. He also suggests that she be very careful coming home from work, a maniac being on the loose.When she arrives home. Andy notices his wife getting out of the car with a man, who gives her a gentle peck on the cheek. She had told him she was coming home with a woman. She claims the man is a lawyer who is handling old buisness with her mother's estate. Andy apologizes. Later they are eating Chinese food in bed and she seductively feeds him and she gently gyrates on his lap. They begin to have sex, when Andy quickly turns off the light, noticing their next door neighbor's young son is watching them. (He assumes this because of the silhouette in the window). Tracy doesn't seem bothered by it, since the mother works nights and the boy might just be lonely.The next morning, Andy is sanding the stair railing, and is surprised by Jed's appearance in the front doorway. They have a pleasant conversation and Jed invites him to go out for a drink. Jed happens to point out a Degas statue and asks if it's the real thing. Andy assumes it is.As they are drinking, Andy lets it slip that his wife has been having trouble getting pregnant. He mentions a doctor named Lillianfield that Tracy has been going to. Jed says he is a good man. When he gets home, he suggests to Tracy that Jed take the third floor as a tenant. Tracy does not seem thrilled with the idea, even suggesting that Andy is doing it to relive his high school years again, hanging with the star quarterback. When she finds out that Andy discussed her problem with Jed, she is annoyed, but not mad. She gives in and says it's OK for Jed to move in. The doorbell rings and she asks Andy if he wants to bet if it's Jed. He says no. Because when money is involved, you take me seriously, she mutters.Detective Harris comes in while Andy is in the middle of a session with Paula Bell (Gwenyth Paltrow). He asks his secretary to make sure she gets a wake up call in order to not miss her next class. Harris tells Andy that not much progress is being made on getting the rapist. Andy laments that he is tired of seeing students leaving the school for fear of their safety. She asks for a list of people who have access to the student's schedules.Tracy comes home and prepares to take a bath. Her pain shoots up again and she is startled when Jed appears in the bathroom to check on her. They share a long glance as they hear Andy announce that he is home. Later that night, Jed is involved in a sexual marathon with one of the nurses from the hospital. Tracy is extremely annoyed because the noise is keeping her awake. As Andy is about to go ask him to hold it down, the noise stops. The nurese jokes with him that the only reason he is a doctor is for the money and women. He laughs, and jokes about his tolerance with alcohol. After coming out of the bathroom, Tracy stares coldly as the nurse runs naked to the upstairs bathroom.The next day. Andy is annoyed that Paula still has not shown up for her appointment. After talking to his secretary, he decides to go to her house to check on her. He arrives and the house is completely quiet. He calls out for her, but gets no answer. The front door is open, so he lets himself inside. He then notices the back door is slightly ajar and that a lock of her hair is on the floor. He walks out back and notices one of her shoes. He then approaches the hedges and finds her brutalized body hidden inside. Detective Harris says he will need to provide a statement.Leter, Jed tries to cheer up Andy at the bar. He relays a story about the first time he saw a dead body in medical school. After Jed makes a comment about pro athletes not being able to stay clean for a million dollars, Andy says he would give his right arm for a million. Jed presses him on it, saying what if was a surgical prcedure. Would he do it? Andy says no, as does Jed after cracking an ice cube in his mouth. Andy heads home as Jed decides to check on the local women playing darts.Andy comes home and Harris is waiting for him. She tells him there is circumstantial evidence tying him to the rapes. He is outraged at being considered a suspect. She then tells him he needs to come to the station to provide some sperm to rule him out. Reluctantly, he agrees to go.Tracy comes home and her pain is now unbearable. She calls out for Andy, but he is still at the station. She calls 911. While chatting it up with the dart ladies and drinking bourbon, Jed is paged to the hospital, where he sees that Tracy is the person he needs to operate on. Back at the station Andy is ruled out as a suspect and as he is leaving, is told his wife called 911. He rushes to the hospital.It turns out one of her ovaries has ruptured and needs to be removed. They discover that she was 4 weeks pregnant, but she miscarries due to the trauma. A doctor notices a problem with the second ovary and Jed says they need to get a histology report to make sure it isn't still a live ovary. They realize they don't have the time to do it. Jed goes out and tells Andy the options. They can remove the ovary and she'll be fine (but never able to have kids). Or they can leave the ovary in and hope she does not die from toxic shock. Andy says to do whatever he needs to. He tells Andy that she was 4 weeks pregnant, but the baby is gone. Jed goes in and against the advice of fellow surgeons, he removes the other ovary.Later, it comes to light that he removed a healthy ovary. Jed has the chance to bury the report, but declines. He stands by his judgement call. The turn of events destroys Tracy. She tells Andy she is leaving him, and she files a lawsuit against Jed Hill, for $20 million.At the deposition, Jed is made out to be a top notch surgeon, but has a God-complex. He states that when people go into the chapel and pray to God that their loved ones will be alright, who does the lawyer think they are praying to. You ask me if I have a God complex. Let me tell you something. I am God. He then gets up and walks out. Tracy's lawyer then mentions they know he was drinking the night of her surgery. They decide to settle. Tracy doesn't seem to care about the money. As she exits the building, she notices Andy across the street. She shoots him a cold stare and then leaves in her lawyer's car.Back at work, Andy is working late into the night, when one of his bulbs goes out. He goes downstairs and finds the janitor (Tobin Bell) has a makeshift place and is living down there. He finds a lock of hair on the night table as well as in a cigar box. He is startled when he appears behind him. He explains that he got kicked out of his old place and this is just temporary. Andy says not to worry about it and leaves. As he is walking away, he is jumped from behind and he ends up fighting him off and rendering him unconscious.At the station, Detective Harris invites Andy to get a drink. While there, she talks about how her family accuses her of wielding her honesty like a blunt instrument. She tells him that there is something he needs to know about his wife. Something important. He goes back to the station with her.Later, he goes to Jed's hotel to tell him that thet baby was not his. It turns out that Andy is sterile (which cleared him of the rapes). Jed tells him it doesn't change anything regarding his situation. He feels bad for Andy and says that bad things happen to good people all the time, for no good reason. Andy, suspecting that maybe Tracy's lawyer is the father, goes to confront him.Andy barges in and accuses her lawyer (Peter Gallagher) of having an affair with his wife. He says he did not. But since he cannot give him any information about where she is, he should talk to her friends or mother. Andy says he should know her mother is dead, since he handled her estate. He says he never did. As he is leaving, he suggests that Andy bring her a bottle of scotch.Andy arrives and uses the bottle of scotch to entice Tracy's mother (Anne Bancroft) to open the door. They talk about Tracy's childhood, how she always stashed away any money she had, how her father abandoned her and took her hidden money. As she is drinking, she laughs about how gullable Andy is. He says he knows she has been there becuase of the Degas statue on her mantle. She laughs and say you can get one of them anywhere. She then tries to get him to do a card trick, and asks him to bet. He says no. Because when money is involved, you take me seriously. She then tells him he should just get into the game and go for the $20 million himself. When he brings up Dr. Lillianfield, she smiles and tells him Welcome to the game.He finds Lillianfield's address through a ruse using a change of address excuse. He finds out the address and lies in wait inside the house. He hears Tracy as she comes in the door. To his horror, Dr Lillianfield turns out to be Jed Hill. They kiss passionately as she orders him to take her upstairs and have sex with her. After they go upstairs, Andy leaves the house, devestated.He goes home and knocks a bunch of items from her dresser to the floor. But, he notices something odd. There is a syringe with some liquid still inside of it. He then notices they neighbor's son's silhouette again, playing on his keyboard.As they walk along the beach the next morning, Jed laments about how his mentor wrote him a letter saying he was sorry about everything. While Tracy finds it amusing, Jed is upset that his mentor never apologized about not giving him the chief of staff job at Mass General. They kiss and head back to the house to make love again. While she is laying on the bed, a syringe sticks her. Jed realizes that now Andy knows what it going on, that he has been in the house. Jed rehashes the plan and lets Tracy know the improvised part of her getting pregnant was what tipped Andy off. He figured out there was no Dr Lillianfield. Tracy says to let her handle him.At a bar/restaurant, Tracy acts all loving and seductive with Andy, trying to convince him that things can go back to normal. She runs her foot up his leg, until Andy tells her that she dropped her shoe. She realizes that her ploy is not working. She then goes on the attack, trying to intimidate him, saying that if he goes to the police, that will make him look crazy. She gets up and wishes him happy hunting. Andy then tells her to sit the f*** down. He tells her he knows what was in the syringe and that the lab guys told him that the substance in the syringe could cause the ovarian cysts she got if injected in massive doses. He then suggests that maybe he should have put curtains up in the bedroom because someone might have seen her injecting herself to cause the cysts. Enraged, she shatters a wine glass in her hand. He then warns her that if anything is to happen to him, the police will go to her neighbor's son. He wants half the money.Back at the house, Jed suggests strongly they give him the money and they should leave the country. He tells her they don't have a choice. She then suggests that without the kid, there is no case. He is horrified by the suggestion. He then slaps her and tells her not to bring it up again. If something happens to the kid, he will be the state's star witness against her. She then pulls out a gun and kills him.Tracy waits outside her former neighbor's house and waits for her to leave. She calls Andy and tells him she has his money. He gives her a meeting place and then heads out in his car. After he leaves, she approaches the neighbor's house. She then silently walks upstairs and slowly approaches the boy with plastic wrap, while he is playing his keyboard as usual. She puts it around his head, only to find that it is really a CPR dummy from the police station. Tracy goes ballastic, smashing the dummy on the keyboard. Andy turns out the light and taunts her saying, Like shooting tuna in a barrel, huh? She lunges for him and they fall through a bannister and land on the floor. As she is about to get up, Detective Harris, dressed as the neighbor (she is a nurse), stomps on a piece of wood Tracy is preparing to pick up saying I won't mind shooting you. She tells Andy he may need a doctor. He laughs.Tracy is led out to the police car and sees the neighbor and her BLIND son go back into the house. She is stunned. She looks at Andy with a mixture of sadness, shock and, belatedly, respect. The car drives off and Harris and Andy sit on his porch. She suggests he needs ice. He says he'll take his with some scotch. They head off in her car.THE END

title: Saving Mr. Banks
synopsis: The film begins in Australia, 1906. We start in the sky and for a moment, see the shadow of an umbrella in the clouds. The camera goes lower and lower as a weathervane turns to point east and a young girl, Ginty (the real name of P.L. Travers) is seen playing make believe in her front yard. The disembodied voice of Travers Goff says, Winds in the East, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store but I feel what's to happen all happened before. This is the same overture that begins Mary Poppins.Now it's the year 1961. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is a beautiful, sophisticated and smart but also grumpy, stuffy and rather unkind woman living in London. Her home office reveals she has already found success as the author of the Mary Poppins series. The doorbell rings and she finds Diarmiud Russell, her agent. They talk in her living room. She tells him she's cancelled the car because she no longer needs a ride to the airport, having changed her mind about giving up the rights to her story. Diarmuid points out she has a verbal agreement and can be sued but she replies by saying she has no money for him to claim. He confirms this as he reminds her that sales have dried up and there are no more royalties -- and that she has just recently reached terms after 20 years of being pursued -- no animation, script approval. To keep her house, Pamela agrees to venture to Los Angeles to hear the studio out but promises to leave the papers unsigned if she's not happy with their interpretation.In a flashback, we see Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) surprise his daughter, a young Pamela, nicknamed Ginty. He says he's looking for his daughter, the royal princess, and Ginty laughs and reveals it's her. They are obviously close. He puts her on his shoulders and they rush into the park, with him telling her their adventure is about to begin.In current day, Pamela is trying to load a giant bag into the overhead locker. A flight attendant asks if she needs help but Pamela refuses, saying she's perfectly capable. She blames the nearby passengers for being greedy and taking up the space. The flight attendant suggests they put the bag up front but Pamela refuses since it should remain close to her assigned seat. A nearby woman offers to have her bag taken up front instead; instead of thanking her, Pamela notices her toddler and asks if baby is going to be a nuisance during the flight. She then settles into her seat and says, I hope we crash.In 1906, we meet Ginty's three-year-old sister, Biddy, and her delicate mother, Margaret. Ginty is playing with her father, as usual. They all hold suitcases and say goodbye to the staff that used to take care of their house; they now walk on foot throughout town to get to the train station. Travers turns it into a game but his wife is heartbroken. They finally take the train to its very last stop, Allora, a rundown city.In 1961, Pamela is on the plane and awakes with a jerk from her memory. When she arrives at LAX, she exits the plane and finds a driver holding a sign with her name and Walt Disney Presents. This is the first time we've heard it is Disney that wants her story and not the other major studios. Her driver, Ralph (Paul Giamatti) greets her enthusiastically, a huge contrast from her grumpy persona. As they drive in his town car, Ralph optimistically talks about the sunny day and how, outside, it smells like jasmine; Pamela thinks it's more like chlorine and sweat. He tries to make her comfortable but she finds him irritating and raises the screen to separate her from him. He is unfazed.Pamela arrives at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The porter offers to help her unpack but she tells him if wants to handle ladies' garments, he should get a job in a launderette. He leaves, without a tip, and Pamela then becomes horrified at all the gifts Walt Disney has had put in her room, to welcome her. Flowers, champagne, a fruit basket, Disney merchandise. But her biggest concern is the pears in the fruit basket, so she plucks them all out.Cut to a flashback of the Goff family (PLs real last name) settling into their Allora house. It is a rundown shack on barren land, obviously heartbreaking for Margaret (Ginty's mother). But Travers calls it a palace and boasts that they now have chickens and in this smaller house, Ginty will get to SHARE a bedroom.In the current day, Pamela walks to the balcony and throws the pears she had plucked from the fruit basket into the hotel pool. She then goes back in her room and gathers up all the Disney paraphernalia, shoving it all into a closet, and arranging a giant stuffed Mickey Mouse that's been left on the bed so that it faces out of the window. She tells it, You can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety. She is clearly nervous about Walt Disney being the one to adapt her stories into a movie.Pamela unpacks her bag and turns on the hotel television. There, she stumbles upon The Wonderful World of Disney Show with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) hosting. She quickly turns off the TV.The next morning, Ralph picks Pamela up at the hotel. He is friendly, gleeful about how sunny the day is again. She mocks him for getting excited that the sun has come out as if she was in somehow responsible, reminding him it's California. He replies, cheerfully, It certainly is! She gets in the car and says she'd rather be accountable for the rain. He tells her that's sad and she tells him, The rain brings life. He tells her, So does the sun but she tells him to be quiet.When they arrive at the Disney Studios in Burbank, they are greeted by Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), the film's screenwriter, and the Sherman Brothers, who are writing the film's songs (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman). Don is friendly but she is indifferent to him for not calling her Mrs. Travers. She then chastises him for telling the Sherman Brothers that she created Mary and not Mary Poppins. Finally, she reveals she is not planning on giving away the rights to the character because the film should not be upbeat nor a musical. They try to take her on the tour of the studio but she says doesn't care and only wants to see Walt.Pamela is now in Walt's office. She demands that his secretary tell him she's arrived. Don tells her she can call him Walt because he thinks Mr. Disney is unnecessary. Walt arrives, enthusiastically greeting her, but Pamela remains unfriendly, calling him Mr. Disney even when he insists she just call him Walt. In his private office, he reminds Pamela that he's been trying for 20 years to talk her into giving him the film rights. His daughters were reading the Mary Poppins book back then and he promised them he would turn it into a film. That's why he has been adamant in securing the rights so he can live up to this promise, as well as making kids happy who will finally get to see Mary speak and sing to them. Pamela uses this to bring up her disapproval of the film being turned into a musical, explaining a governess shouldn't be giddy. She writes off Disney as creating silly cartoons. He tries to reassure her that he won't tarnish the story she holds dear to her because he loves Mary Poppins, too. Pamela reminds him that she has not signed the agreement yet and that it stipulates the film will be live action and not animated -- she wants this made clear via a recorded statement by Walt. He remains calm, telling her they're going to make something wonderful. She responds by saying she has yet to see if that is even possible, and then exits the office, leaving Walt dumbfounded.In flashback, Travers is playing a whistle while Ginty listens from his lap. Margaret comes to the porch and suggests Ginty go to bed. Alone on the porch, Travers promises his wife a good life and to make her proud of him again. She is hopeful.In present day, Pamela is in a rehearsal room on the studio property. She prepares for the meeting, stone-faced, while Walt's secretary, Dolly, fills the room with snacks and beverages. This irritates Pamela who says the amount of food could save a starving country and complains that the flowers in the room could have easily been enjoyed from a window without having to be yanked out of the ground. She turns on the tape recorder to document all of her input since she has demanded creative control. They begin to read the script, with Don reading the scene heading of Exterior, 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Pamela interjects, asking what is EXT? She then demands it be spelled out and not abbreviated, and also that it should be NUMBER 17 Cherry Tree Lane instead of 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Dolly comes in with more snacks and Pamela gets irritated.As the read-through continues, Pamela voices her concern about casting Dick Van Dyke, suggesting they use Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton or Alec Guinness instead. The Sherman Brothers begin to sing the song they've written for the opening -- but Pamela stops them to point out responstable is not a word. When Richard excitedly tells her they made the world up, Pamela tells them to un-make it up. At the piano, Richard hides the next page of sheet music a song titled Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Pamela then suggests they work the old vaudeville song, Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay, into the film instead of the original music the Sherman Brothers are suggesting.At home, Pamela reminiscences about her childhood, bringing us to a flashback of Travers telling Ginty her horse is actually Uncle Albert under the spell of a witch. He lifts her up and tells her to pretend to fly.The next session in the rehearsal room, Pamela is shown storyboard illustrations and finds fault with them all. She tells the team that the illustration of the Banks's house doesn't look as she imagines it and that Mrs. Banks shouldn't be a suffragette and shouldn't be named Cynthia. When she sees a picture of Mr. Banks, she says that it's not him because hes not supposed to have a mustache. She explains, the only reason he has facial hair in the books is because the illustrator ignored her wishes but now that it is HER film, she will have her way. Dolly points out the mustache was a specific request from Walt. Pamela replies that Mr. Banks is clean shaved. Finally, Robert erupts, saying Does it matter?! Pamela stares at him and then orders him to wait outside.She goes back to the hotel, the merry sounds of people bringing her to a flashback of her with her father. He shaves his face clean and asks if she prefers a rough face when he gives her kisses or one that;s silky smooth. It's obvious that Mr. Banks is based on him, thus why she was insisting that Mr. Banks look as she envisioned him.The next time she's at the Disney Studios, she gets frantic after Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is introduced. Dolly goes to Walt's office to give him an update -- Pamela wants Mrs. Banks's name changed to Winifred, she doesn't want Dick Van Dyke, she doesn't like the house, she doesn't want Mr. Banks to have a mustache, the tape measure used to record the children's height should be a roll tape and not a ruler, she only wants green vegetables and broth for snacks (in the rehearsal room), and that she doesn't want the color red in the film -- at all.Walt now joins Pamela and the others in the rehearsal room. She reminds him that she has final say and insists, again, that there should be no red in the movie. He points out that the film is set in London where there's a lot of red but she says she wants it banished simply because she feels anti-red at the moment. He asks if she's testing him but she replies she took him at his word when he said that she would get final say on everything. She offers to return the agreement back to him, unsigned, so he agrees that there will be no red in the film.Walt leaves and the others now realize that Walt has not been granted the rights yet. Pamela asks them to sing another song. They sing The Perfect Nanny and Pamela shouts criticisms throughout. As they continue on, she shouts into the tape recorder, Nobody's listening to me! as if her documented complaints will then hold merit. When the song finishes, Pamela says it's the worst song she's ever heard.Later that afternoon, Walt is looking out his window. He sees Pamela sitting on a bench, getting into the limo after Ralph arrives. Back at the hotel, Pamela has another memory -- as a young girl, she enters the bank in Allora where her father works since it is their special Ice Cream Day; but Travers is intoxicated and is fired by his employer, all in front of Ginty. The boss finally agrees to hire him back upon seeing Travers's daughter but tells him that he needs to straighten himself out, for his daughters sake. Moments later, Travers and Ginty are by the river; she eats ice cream while he drinks from a hip flask and gives a drunken speech.Pamela calls her agent from her hotel room, complaining about the adaptation of her story and how she is having flashbacks of her childhood. But she has to admit that she needs the money. After hanging up the phone, she pulls the giant Mickey Mouse from the window and cuddles with it for comfort.The next morning, the rehearsal room has healthier options for food (per Pamela's request). The Sherman Brothers brainstorm ideas until they come up with a spoonful of sugar.Outside, Walt meets Pamela at the limo and escorts her upstairs. The brothers play the newly written Spoonful of Sugar, deciding that the word down should be played higher, along the lines of Mary Poppins doing the unexpected, like going UP the bannisters. They are in love with this new song and predict it will be iconic. Pamela is unimpressed and calls it an annoying tune akin to something that would play at Walt's themed park, all giddy and carefree. She points out to Walt that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy; that she is truthful and doesn't sugar coat the darkness to the children. She complains that the script is flim flam and not rooted in reality. After declaring it has no weight, she opens a window and flings the pages out -- proving that the script literally has no weight. Walt responds by saying Says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children. Pamela responds, You think Mary Poppins is saving the children? She sighs and shakes her head.Late that afternoon, Pamela is on the same bench. She thinks back to playing with the laundry hanging outside when her dad comes home early. They chase a hen who Travers says is their foul Aunt Ellie in disguise. During the game, Pamela's mum notices a whisky bottle protruding from Travers's pocket. That night, Ginty stays awake at night, while her parents argue; her mother is suggesting Ellie come over to help the family raise the girls.In the rehearsal studio the next day, Richard previews Feed the Birds, which touches Walt. They both fear Pamela will hate it, nonetheless.In another flashback, we see Ginty and her father playing pretend, which irritates Margaret. Travers tells Ginty, Don't ever stop dreaming. You can be anyone you want to be. She says she wants to be like him but he tells her Don't. He begins crying.Ralph drives Pamela but she is distracted. Her memories continue. Ginty gives a speech at her school fair. Her father is going to be presenting the medals on behalf of the bank.In the rehearsal room, Pamela is still distracted. They get her attention and perform Fidelity Fiduciary Bank for her. This is juxtaposed with another fantasy, of her father showing up to the fair drunk. When he presents the medals, he tries to promote the bank he works at but he meanders, obviously drunk. As the bank song continues in present day, it is repeated as dialogue in the flashback. Finally, when Travers is supposed to present the medals, he slurs his speech. He tells everyone that his daughter has opened a bank account and the crowd should give her a drink, but then corrects himself, stressing give her a hand. He calls her up on stage but she is embarrassed and crushed, as her father was her hero. Somehow, he loses his footing and falls off of the stage. The crowd gasps, judgmentally.In present day, the Brothers applaud their new song along with Walt. Pamela can only say, Why did you have to make him so cruel? He was not a monster! She asks if they have children and they say, yes; she then points out all the mean things that Mr. Banks is written as doing, such as tearing up the advertisement the children have written, refusing to mend their kite. It's now obvious to us that she's protective of Mr. Banks's image and has issues with the story because all the characters are based on her family. She tells them she can't bear to let him down again and leaves the room, upset.In a flashback, Travers is in bed with a broken foot from the fall. He asks the doctor for painkillers but the doctor realizes that he just wants the high. After he leaves, Travers asks Ginty to get him a bottle of medicine that her mother has hidden but she refuses, knowing of her mum's decision. She tries to share a poem she wrote for him at school that won first prize; he reads it and tells her It's hardly Yeats, is it? Ginny is devastated. We now realize that this is the turning point in Pamela's life.Pamela rushes through the Disney lot and finds a quiet spot on the lawn in the back of a sound stage. She has more flashbacks; Ginty finding the bottle of medicine and leaving it with her sleeping father. Pamela is daydreaming, playing with a daisy, when Ralph catches her. He has brought her tea but Pamela tells him it is blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup. Nonetheless, she lets him have a conversation with her, despite being obviously upset. She tells him she wants to go back to England and points out she doesn't really have any close family members. He tells her his daughter is handicapped and it's made him appreciate sunny days where she can sit outside in the garden and not be cooped up inside, like on rainy days (a callback to his cheerfulness about the weather when they first met). Now warming to him, Pamela shows off a park she has built in the grass, with twigs. She pours her tea to make a stream.In flashback, Margaret enters Ginty's bedroom at night and tells her she knows she gave her father the bottle of pills. She tells Ginty that she is aware she loves her father more than her, but one day, she'll understand. Margaret then leaves the house, despite Ginty's screams for her to come back. Ginty then has to comfort her younger sister by telling her a story about little girls alone in a house who shouldn't be afraid because a guide will show up from the stars and show them magic.Ginty goes out looking for her mother. She finds her in the freezing water of the creek. She convinces her mum to go home.In current day, Pamela gets a phone call from Walt. He wants to know why she has been so upset lately. She doesn't have a response. He suggests the two of them go to Disneyland. She is less than enthusiastic at the suggestion, calling it a dollar printing machine, but he doesn't take no for an answer, hanging up on her.In a flashback, Aunt Ellie arrives at the Goff household with a parrot-headed umbrella and giant carpetbag. She is obviously the inspiration for Mary Poppins. She tells Ginty's sister to close her mouth because she is not a codfish (a line from the film). She puts the girls to work and is very strict with them.Ralph drives Pamela to Disneyland and they park on the property. Walt Disney greets them, exciting Ralph who has never met him in person; Pamela is not impressed though. The two walk through the park where young fans ask for Walt's autograph. Walt gives out pre-signed pictures, his method of dealing with attention when he goes to the park. Walt encourages the crowd to get Pamela's signature too and even though they happily offer her something to sign, she mockingly rejects them (possibly implying a case of inferiority complex).As they walk down Disneyland's Main Street, Walt asks Pamela where she came from. Pamela knows he is talking about Mary Poppins and says she flew in through the window one day. He is not impressed with her standoffish attitude and says, because she clearly doesn't want to be there, they'll go on one ride and then go. The two are now on King Arthur's Carousel. Pamela hesitates to get on the ride, even after Walt tries to coerce her, by pointing out that there's a child in all of us. She only gives in after Walt adamantly demands Get on the horse, Pamela. He then tells her the Sherman Brothers have an idea for Mr. Banks that will be to her liking. She asks if he brought her all the way to Disneyland just to tell her that; he responds, no, he had made a bet that he couldn't get her on one ride and now he just earned 20 bucks.In flashback, Aunt Ellie takes care of Travers, who is coughing up blood. Outside, Ginty cries at the decline of her fathers health.In the rehearsal room, there are no more snacks and all the tables have been pushed to the side. Don is eager to show Pamela the new scene they have written for Mr. Banks. It ends up being Lets Go Fly a Kite. Having come to peace with her past, Pamela can't help but hum along and then sing along and then dances. Dolly is ecstatic and runs to Walt's office where she tells him, I'm sorry to interrupt but Mrs. Travers - she's dancing with Don!Back in the rehearsal room, the song ends and Pamela admits she loves the song. But, in character, she points out that the proper English should be Let US go AND fly a kite. She is willing to overlook this, though.In a flashback, Ginty sits with her father in his bedroom. She says she has rewritten the poem he didn't like but he doesn't reply. She shows him the tuppence that Aunt Ellie has given her and asks if he wants anything. He asks for pears. Ginty steps out to get some pears. In present day, Pamela awakes in her hotel room from her dream, a memory of the day her father died.Now, riding in the limo, Pamela is upbeat, matching Ralph's optimistic perspective on life. In the rehearsal room, Pamela is much more pleasant. She okays the Jolly Holiday song but when she asks how they plan to train penguins, Richard tells her, They're animated. Upon hearing there will be cartoons in the film, Pamela storms out. She runs to Walt's office, uninvited, and calls him a trickster, a fraudster, a sneak. Pamela tells him that the music of the Sherman Brothers has charmed her but she won't cross the line and allow animated, dancing penguins. She gives him back the unsigned rights papers and says good day. Walt chases after Pamela but she just tells him he isn't living up to his promises. Ralph arrives and is about to drive her away. She tells Walt Disney she's sorry to put him through so much trouble but she is not ready to give her (Mary Poppins) up. They drive away.Pamela is driven to LAX. Ralph tells her it was a pleasure driving her, which she doesn't believe. He says he didn't know who she was until he mentioned to his daughter that he was driving around a Mrs. Travers for Walt Disney and she made him go to her bedroom and take her Mary Poppins book. He says he can't stop reading it. Pamela says she'd be honored to sign it. He asks her to inscribe it to Jane, his daughter. She hands him a piece of stationery with a list of names Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo and tells him to give it to his daughter and tell her that a lot of people with difficulties do extraordinary things with their lives. At the bottom of the list is Walt Disney's name; she points out that he had difficulty concentrating and had hyperactive behavior as a kid.In his office, Walt Disney looks down at the paperwork with Pamela's flight itinerary, confirming she has, in fact, gone back to London. He wonders why her name is listed as Helen Goff and his secretary points out that it's her real name and she's actually Australian, not British. He wonders where she got the name Travers.In a flashback, Ginty comes home with the pears and discovers Ellie holding a bloodstained sheet. She drops the bag of pears onto the floor. Ginty rushes past her mum and aunt and steps into her fathers bedroom. She watches him die. She apologizes for dropping the pears.In London, Pamela settles back into her home, the one she can no longer afford. Later that night, there's a knock on the door and Walt Disney is there. He requests she make him a pot of tea. They talk and Walt tells her she misjudges him that she thinks of him as a Hollywood King Midas with an empire and that Mary Poppins will be just another brick in. He tells her, if this was the case, he wouldn't have pursued her for 20 years. He tells her Mary Poppins is real to his daughters, to thousands of children, and even adults. Walt apologizes to Pamela for letting her down and points out that he, too, had a Mr. Banks but his had a mustache; it was his own father, who had a newspaper delivery route and employed a young Walt and his brother to work during the cold winters. If he didn't live up to his father's standards, he would get beaten. He says he loves his father but he has days where he looks back and is tired of thinking of him in a negative light. He has to learn to finish the story differently, to let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by the past. He realizes now, as she hinted, that it's not the children Mary Poppins comes to save but her father, Travers Goff. She must have loved him a lot to take his name. He now realizes all of her books were about him and encourages her to forgive him. She says she doesn't have to forgive her father, he was a wonderful man, but he says, no, she needs to forgive Helen Goff for giving herself a harsh sentence. He begins a monologue, telling her to trust her precious Mary Poppins with him and the audience will see Mr. Banks being saved and he can instill hope into the viewers.Pamela looks at the giant Mickey Mouse that she has brought home with her. She agrees to sign the papers.Years later, Mary Poppins is having its world premiere in Los Angeles. Pamela is not invited because Walt is afraid she will be a very difficult person and talk negatively with any journalist who asks her for an interview.In London, Pamela is writing a new Mary Poppins book and now has enough money to have a maid. Downstairs, her agent asks her if she's going to the film's premiere and she says she's not interested. He can tell that she wasn't invited and points out that Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for it.Pamela takes a plane again. The same flight attendant from before asks if she needs help with her bags and then recognizes Pamela from before. She lets her take care of herself.Walt returns to his office to find that Pamela is there, waiting. She points out she didn't receive an invitation and it must have gotten lost in the mail. Walt promises to issue a replacement.At her hotel, she asks the doorman to call for a taxi but just then, a limo pulls up. It is Ralph who is going to take her to the premiere.Pamela gets to the Grauman's Chinese Theater where various Disney characters mingle alongside celebrities, including the cast of Mary Poppins. Before she exits the limo, Ralph whispers to her, This is your night. None of this would be possible without you. He helps her to the carpet but she walks unnoticed, except for a giant Mickey Mouse who interacts with her.Inside, Pamela watches the film. She looks around at everyone in the audience laughing, singing along, having a good time. The scenes in the film remind her of her history, that we are now familiar with via the flashbacks.By the end of the movie, Pamela has tears streaming down her face. Walt Disney is sitting behind her. He leans forward and whispers It's all right, Mrs. Travers. Mr. Banks is going to be all right. She nods but responds, No, no. It's just that I can't abide cartoons!The final song plays, Lets Go Fly a Kite. Pamela can't help but sing along. She has one final flash back of Ginty at her father's bedside as he promises her I will never leave you. Cut back to the opening scene of the film with Ginty sitting in the grass embracing her father. The prologue from Mary Poppins again being spoken by Travers, the same weathervane turning to the west and the shadow of an umbrella. But this time, we rise higher and higher into the sky indicating that Marry Poppins work with Pamela is done and both can finally move on.During the first part of the credits there are pictures of the real Pamela Travers, Walt Disney, Sherman brothers, Don DaGradi, one of the men who inspired Ralph and concept art of the Mary Poppins film. During the second part there is seen a tape recorder next to a bowl of jellybeans (no doubt to recreate the moment) while recorded dialogue between the real Pamela, Sherman brothers and Don is heard as they discuss the script. As the tape runs out the screen turns to black.

title: Tomorrowland
synopsis: Frank Walker (George Clooney) is talking to an unseen audience about the future when a female voice interrupts him, tell him that his wording is a touch 'bleak.' When the female asks him to think back to when he thought of the future as an optimistic place, he talks about when he went to the 1964 World's Fair in New York City as a child.Young Frank (Thomas Robinson) eagerly enters the Hall of Inventions carrying a very large duffle bag containing his invention: a jet pack he made. Though the judge David Nix (Hugh Laurie) does not show much enthusiasm for the device (which Frank admits doesn't work properly), a little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) seems to think Frank's invention has potential.Outside the hall, Athena catches up with Frank. Giving him a small pin, she requests that he follow her behind a small group. The group also includes Mr Nix, and some guests of his.Putting on the pin, Frank follows the group to the It's a Small World attraction, where Frank bypasses the line and boards one of the boats by himself. During the ride, a laser scans his pin, and he's suddenly plunged down a secret chute, underneath the ride. The boat Frank is on then pulls up at a small transport station.After a disorienting ride, Frank finds himself on a foggy platform, but sees a strange flying vehicle taking off nearby, with Athena waving to him. Frank attempts to follow, but finds himself on the edge of a platform. Suddenly, construction robots arise, creating new structures, but knocking Frank down to a lower level. As his jetpack clatters to the platform, a robot nearby suddenly grabs it! Frank fights to get back his invention, but he is surprised when the huge automaton fixes it! However, Frank inadvertently falls from this platform as well, but upon igniting his jetpack, he finds himself soaring amid a gleaming white cityscape unlike anything he's ever seen before! Eventually, he sees Athena and the others, and touches down right in front of Mr Nix...who only seems mildly amused that Frank's invention can actually fly. Even so, Athena gives the young boy a reaffirming smile.Frank then becomes pessimistic again, when the female voice interrupts that he's seeming negative again. When Frank asks if the unnamed voice would like to take over telling the story, it obliges. We are then introduced to Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), who happily proclaims she's 'an optimist.'After a brief glimpse of a young Casey naming stars in the night sky, we cut to the modern day. Late one evening, Casey surreptitiously enters a Cape Canaveral, Florida NASA launch pad that is being demolished. She sabotages three construction cranes. When she returns home, her dad tells her 'the end' f space shuttle's former launch site is inevitable. Casey still feels she's contributing something with trying to slow down the deconstruction.Unseen by Casey, a dark figure trails her from the NASA site to her home, and quietly slips a small pin into her helmet, dangling from her motorcycle handlebar.The next day, her father Eddie (Tim McGraw) laments how even though he's a NASA engineer, there's very little hope for him to do anything useful. Ever the Optimist, Casey reminds him of the metaphor of two wolves: light and hope, darkness and despair. In the end, as Eddie told Casey, the one who will win, is the one you feed.Casey goes to school, but becomes a bother in all her classes. Her teachers tell of nuclear annihilation, planetary meltdown, and governmental collapse, but Casey just wants to know one thing: how can we fix it? However, this question receives no answers.After hearing word that NASA has brought in working equipment from Orlando to continue disassembling the platform, Casey goes out to stop them, but is caught by NASA security.After her father bails her out of jail, Casey collects her things, but is surprised to find a small pin with the letter T on it. Picking it up, she is surprised when it seems to transport her to an endless field of wheat, with a futuristic city off in the distance.On the ride home, Casey attempts to show the pin to her father, but when Eddie touches it, nothing happens.Later on that evening, Casey sneaks out of the house, and bicycles to a large field. Touching the pin this time, she finds herself in the center of a dazzling futuristic city, with jetpacks and hovertrains! She also becomes enamored seeing a rocket launch station, and follows a group of space travelers...before the pin suddenly runs out of power, and she finds herself having wandered waist-deep into a lake!Waking up her little brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon), she asks him for help trying to find another pin on the Internet. Their search takes them to a website of Blast From The Past, a store in Houston, Texas. Strangely, they only have a street address, but don't list an email or phone number.Casey tells Nate to cover for her while she takes a bus to Houston to talk to the store owners. The next day, Athena sees Nate in front of their home who asks to see Casey. When Nate attempts to tell Athena that Casey is away, she claims he's lying, and asks where she really is.Arriving at Blast From The Past, Casey meets the store owners, Ursula (Kathryn Hahn), and Hugo (Keegan-Michael Key). They tell her that the pin supposedly was a key to showing a world created by some of the greatests geniuses in history, who called themselves Plus Ultra.When the two press Casey for more information on where she got the pin, her claims that she just 'found it' cause the two to get upset. Things take a turn for the strange when the two grab two actual-working laser guns, and attempt to kill her!Casey is saved when Athena appears, stopping the two in their tracks with a time-bomb (a device that stops time temporarily in a 15 foot radius). As the two get free, Casey and Athena fight them, with Athena pulling off Ursula's head, and Hugo being skewered. Both Casey and Athena rush out of the store before Hugo self-destructs, with the small girl then breaking into a car, and allowing the two of them to get away.In the car, Athena tells Casey that the two people they encountered, were Audio-Animatronic figures, and it was she (Athena) who gave Casey the pin. However, the fight has damaged Athena, and Casey panics when she realizes that the little girl is also a robot!Casey attempts to flee with Athena giving chase...but not before a truck slams into the small robot! Casey uses the opportunity to take the truck, but Athena quickly recovers, and chases after Casey, managing to catch up to her! Athena claims she is from the place Casey saw when she touched the pin (which happened to be her last one!), but it may not be there much longer.After a small discussion, Casey is willing to accept that Athena will not harm her. Athena wishes them to drive to Pittsfield, New York, to meet a man named Frank Walker.Back in Houston, Police are combing through the wreckage of the store, when a black van pulls up, and several people get out, led by a smiling man who calls himself Dave Clark (Matthew MacCaull). When one of the officers finds the charred remains of Ursula's head, Dave pulls out a device that disintegrates the nearby officers. Once they are done away with, he informs the other members of his party to contact Governor Nix.Eventually, driving all-night wears Casey out, and she relinquishes the driving duties to Athena...only to awaken on the side of a road, with Athena driving away!Seeing a mailbox nearby with the name Walker on it, she ignores the no trespassing sign and comes onto the property. She soon encounters a barking dog, but upon seeing it leaving no paw prints in the dirt, finds that it is simply a realistic hologram!Going to the front door, a man on the other side tells Casey to leave. When she demands to be taken to the place the pin showed, a concussive blast sends her flying backward, and Frank emerges.Pleading to be taken to the place she saw, Frank tells her it doesn't actually exist. What she saw was a 'commercial' for this place, and they sealed off all ways to get back there (as well as threw him out).Frank once again tells Casey to leave, but she refuses to. As day turns to night, Casey notices a number of cables leading from the main house, and finds they are all attached to an array of antennas and satellite dishes.Setting a nearby tractor on fire, Casey gets Frank to leave the house, and get inside. Frank manages to put out the fire, but Casey refuses to let him back in until he takes her where she wants to go.Exploring the house, she finds some futuristic-looking devices, and a room showing numerous world and political turmoil, along with a countdown clock, and a 'probability' detector.Frank manages to get back in the house, and attempts to get Casey to leave once again, but she demands to know what she has just been witness to. When Frank realizes she won't just leave, he posits a question: What if I could tell you the exact day you would die?Casey claims she'd naturally want to know, but then if she did find out, she wouldn't believe it, and would try to find some way to change the future. Suddenly, the monitors behind her all flicker, and the probability numbers drop by the smallest of percentages...but it's still enough to make Frank take notice!Suddenly, sensors indicate intruders, and a black van with dark-suited figures is seen. Frank attempts to fortify his house, but the intruders break in, revealing they are audio-animatronic figures! Frank manages to grab some things and stuff them in a bag, before he and Casey get into a bathtub, which rockets them out of the house as the former inventor self-destructs his birthplace.The tub lands in a nearby pond, and Casey and Frank emerge to find Athena in a truck nearby. The group begins to drive away from the house, but Frank quickly gets into a small argument with Athena.Athena ends up taking them to a television station, hoping Frank can take them to The Spectacle. Frank at first refuses, but finally relents, willing to accompany them.Leading them into a utility shack, he reveals a secret underground entrance, wherein lies a teleportation machine. As he covers Casey's eyes and ears as part of the teleportation procedure, Frank asks why Athena chose someone like Casey.Because she hasn't given up, the small automaton replies.In a matter of moments, the three are transported to their new location: atop the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, France!After subduing a guard, the group find their way into a small room, wherein are figures of Thomas Edison, Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, and Nicola Tesla. Frank claims that the Eiffel tower functions as an antenna, and a secret gateway the men made, as an emergency entrance to reach their secret city! Frank reveals an Edison Tube, that when put on a phonograph, opens a secret entrance.As the group watches, the tower splits in two, becoming a gantry, and a rocketship emerges from a compartment beneath the ground! Getting into the rocket, the three find French robots also attempting to stop them. However, the rocket blasts off before they can get to the three.After breaking free of Earth's gravity, the main compartment of the rocket flips around, and hurtles back towards Earth, breaking through into another dimension.The three emerge near the rocket area that Casey saw in the commercial, only it's desolate and deserted. Seeing a group of vehicles approach, Frank hands Athena a small device: a 1-kiloton bomb the size of a small ball, that she hides in a compartment inside herself. Frank claims they may need it for leverage.As the group watches, a hover train arrives, and Governor Nix emerges, looking just as he did when Frank first met him. Nix exchanges some short 'pleasantries' with Frank and Athena, and is then introduced to Casey. It is here that Frank explains about the probability blip he saw, feeling she can change things.The group then heads to a central tower, with a giant sphere nearby, sending energy into it. A platform transports the group up, with tachyons bathing the group, showing glimpses of things several moments in the future.As the platform rises into the sphere, a globe rises up on a pedestal in the center of the room. Frank shows Casey that it can take people in and out of places, and go backwards and forwards in time, showing people the Earth. Casey tests it out, and Nix is surprised how quickly she adapts to using it.Zeroing in on the NASA landing platform, Casey pushes into the future, but is surprised when the image becomes fuzzy. Pushing forward, she sees fire and smoke. Going over the globe, she sees other things: cities being destroyed, tornadoes and freak thunderstorms, before seeing her family's home underwater.Frank claims that what they see is said to be coming in a month's time or less. Casey is angered as to why Nix hasn't told anyone on Earth about what will happen, but Nix shows no reason to be concerned: what will happen will happen on Earth. The city will survive. When this prompts Casey to ask why Nix doesn't allow those on Earth to come to the city, he counters that there is too great of a risk for humans to destroy it, just like the Earth.Casey then shows her optimism by refusing to give in to what the machine has shown them, when suddenly, the panoramic view brightens, and the environment looks normal! Frank eagerly tells Nix that he has witnessed what he was talking about, but the Governor taps Frank with a device, knocking him out.Frank awakens in a confined room, with Athena and Casey nearby. Athena tells Frank he is once again to be banished, with Casey upset that Frank didn't tell her about the impending end of the world. Frank tells Case that he knows she's 'special,' but her optimism seems to have dried up. Feeling lied to that the pin seemed broadcast into her mind a vision of a bright future...she suddenly comes to a startling conclusion!Frank's antennas and dishes were grabbing feeds of what the device was broadcasting. But what if it the machine isn't just predicting the future...it is causing people to give in to these visions, and just accept what will happen: a self-fulfilling prophecy doomsday device!The three are brought before Nix, who has decided to banish them to a deserted island, via a portal. Frank attempts to tell Nix about what they found out, but he claims that shutting down the sphere won't make any difference. Casey is still upset that given everything they've seen, little glimmers of hope, this futurist can't seem to see reason, before Frank explains that the sphere was Nix's idea (of which Frank helped to assemble it).Nix's idea was reasonable: broadcast a future in which humanity would be galvanized to do something about what they believed would happen...but instead, all the visions did was make people accept what they saw, and give in. They repackaged what they saw into media, and seemed to care only for the here-and-now, never willing to consider what their actions could mean for the future.The three are about to be put through the portal, when Frank activates the sphere's lift via the controls on Nix's watch! As the two struggle, Frank tells Athena to use the 1-kiloton device to blow up the sphere.However, Nix activates two robots, and Athena is detained. Tossing the device to Casey, she climbs onto the platform. She manages to arm the device, but during Frank's struggle, Nix manages to keep the platform from ascending. With the device armed, and no way up, Casey hurls the device through the portal, with Athena shutting it just before it explodes. However, the blast loosens a piece of architecture, and it crashes down on Nix's leg, pinning him to the ground.Suddenly, Athena sees Nix shoot Frank with a laser gun...only to see it was a tachyon glimpse of the future. Seeing the real thing unfold before her, she rushes into the line of fire, and takes the blast.Frank attempts to get Athena to a repair station, but she tells him she can't be repaired. As she begins to shut down, Athena reveals to Frank glimpses of her memory, via logs:- one tells of how she fears what will happen when he finds out she isn't human, but wishes to support him, as it seems she helps spur on his creativity. - another tells how she may be having emotions towards him, but has decided not to report this.
- the final transmission, shows the year 1984, in which Frank was exiled from Tomorrowland, blaming Athena for what happened.Athena explains that she can still be of use to Frank: she has a self-destruct device within her, and she can be used to destroy the sphere. Using a jet pack, Frank ascends above the city with his former friend and confidante.As she shuts down, Frank drops her into the sphere. Her self-destruct mechanism sends the sphere crashing to the ground, and crushing Governor Nix.Once back on the ground, Casey and Frank wonder what to do next. It is soon decided there is only one thing to do: become proactive!Casey opens the portal near her home, and invites her father and brother into Tomorrowland.Frank decides to reopen the recruitment program, turning on the pin-making machines, and building a number of new child-looking recruiters.We soon find that this is who Casey and Frank have been talking to the whole time: the new recruiters (like Athena). Each one is given their own pin-case, with a mission to find Dreamers, those that will help build a newer, and better Tomorrow.The final images show a number of people finding the T pins. As they each touch them, we then see dozens of people popping up in the vast wheat field, eyes drawn towards the spires of Tomorrowland.

title: Ratatouille
synopsis: The movie opens with a TV show featuring Chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), owner of the best restaurant in Paris, talking about his bestselling cookbook, which proudly bears his mantra Anyone Can Cook!A rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) begins talking about his life in monologue fashion. Remy states that he has enhanced senses of both taste and smell, which makes him very particular about what he eats. Remy's brother Emile (Peter Sohn) is impressed by this talent, but their father Django (Brian Dennehy) who leads the rats' colony, could care less - until Remy reveals that he can recognize the scent of rat poison in or near food. Django puts Remy to work sniffing and testing food for the rest of the clan. Remy is not happy about the rats having to steal food from the garbage; he would prefer to go to the kitchen and take the fresh samples. But Django hates and fears humans so he forbids Remy (and all other members of the clan) to interact with them.Despite his father's orders, Remy spends several nights in a human home, reading Chef Gusteau's cookbook and watching television programs about cooking. Before long he has a near-expert level of knowledge about food preparation. One day, Remy takes Emile into the kitchen to get some spices that will go with some other food samples they have gathered. Emile hesitates, but agrees to go with his brother. While inside, Remy sees on TV that a famous food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), gave Gusteau's restaurant a less-than-stellar review that resulted in the restaurant losing one of its five stars. A heartbroken Gusteau died soon after, which meant the loss of another star according to tradition.While watching news of Gusteau's death, Remy accidentally wakes the elderly woman who lives in the home which the rats have colonized. Django orders everyone to get away as fast as possible but Remy stays behind to grab Gusteau's book. The rats manage to escape on miniature rafts into a river. Remy uses the cookbook as a flotation device but is separated from the group by a rapid current in the sewers.Hours later, Remy sits, reading the cookbook, waiting for a sign of his friends and family. Through a fusion of grief, loneliness and hunger, Remy begins to hallucinate that the illustration of Chef Gusteau is talking to him. Gusteau encourages Remy to go up through the sewers and find out where he is now. Remy travels along several pipes and finds that he is in Paris - just in front of Gusteau's restaurant!Inside Gusteau's, the new head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) meets Alfredo Linguini (Lou Romano), the son of Chef Gusteau's recently-deceased old friend. Linguini gives Skinner a letter written by his mother in the hope of getting a job at the restaurant. Skinner makes Linguini a garbage-boy and tells him to start work immediately.As Remy watches the action in the kitchen, he spots Linguini accidentally knocking over a pot of soup and trying to cover up his error by adding random ingredients. Knowing that the combination Linguini has forged will be terrible, Remy jumps down and adds his own ingredients to the mixture. Linguini spots Remy and traps him underneath a bowl before he can run away and without anybody else noticing. Skinner spots Linguini messing with the soup and is furious, but he cannot stop the wait staff from serving the soup. A bowl is served to a food critic, who likes the concoction. Skinner still wants to fire Linguini, but another chef, Colette (Janeane Garofolo), sticks up for Linguini. Skinner relents and allows Linguini to stay.Remy makes another attempt to escape, but this time Skinner spots him and Linguini manages to catch Remy in a jar. Skinner orders Linguini to take the rat away and kill it. Linguini takes Remy to a river but cannot bring himself to dispose of the rat. Linguini knows that the rat was the one who really made the soup and that Skinner will expect a duplication of the recipe. Linguini, seeing that Remy can apparently understand him, takes the rat home and essentially adopts him.The next morning, Linguini sees that the rat (who he has nicknamed Little Chef) has cooked breakfast for them both. When they arrive at the restaurant, Linguini tries to find a way to have Remy cook but without anyone else seeing. After a few tries, they find out that Remy can manipulate Linguini like a puppet by pulling on the boy's hair at strategic moments. Deciding that this is their best method, Linguini and Remy spend the next few days practicing cooking in their spare time. Before long they are able to make a perfect duplicate of the soup that captured the critic's attention. Skinner appoints Colette to teach Linguini about the finer points of haute cuisine. Colette does not relish the task at first; she's the only female chef, worked very hard to obtain her position and sees Linguini as a possible threat to her status.Later that night Skinner meets with an agent. We learn that since Chef Gusteau's death, Skinner has been making a profit by selling out the Gusteau name and image to a line of cheap frozen food. Taking a moment to read the letter from Linguini's mother, Skinner panics and calls his lawyer. The lawyer (Teddy Newton) explains that Gusteau's will stipulates that if no heir can be found after two years (a deadline which expires in a month), Skinner will inherit the restaurant. Apparently the letter from Linguini's mother states that Linguini is Gusteau's son, and should be the rightful heir! Skinner refuses to believe it while the lawyer suggests doing a DNA test as well as a background check.Colette begins training Linguini about the fine art of cooking, and a rapport develops between the two.One night, a group of guests asks the head waiter Mustafa (John Ratzenberger) about what is new. The staff panics, but Skinner decides to have Linguini prepare an old Gusteau-style recipe for sweetbreads. Skinner knows that Gusteau considered that recipe a disaster and hopes that it will be Linguini's downfall.Colette begins to follow the recipe but Linguini (under Remy's manipulations) alters it severely, which angers her. But a few minutes later, Mustafa bursts in and declares that the customers love the new concoction and there are several more orders for it! The other chefs toast Linguini's success later that evening. Skinner, knowing about the rat, brings Linguini into his office and pulls out a bottle of rare Château Latour in an attempt to get Linguini to talk about his secrets but gets nowhere.Meanwhile Remy, resting outside, spots a mysterious figure in the garbage pails. He is stunned to find that it is his brother Emile! Overjoyed, Remy runs inside to steal some ingredients to fix food for his brother. Afterwards, Emile brings Remy to the new colony. Django is overjoyed to find his second son alive. Remy wants to leave the colony (and return to Linguini) but Django is opposed to the idea. Django brings Remy to a storefront that specializes in rat-killing, stating his belief that humans and rats must always be enemies. Remy, however, feels differently. He leaves the colony and goes back to Linguini.Next morning, Remy finds Linguini still at the restaurant and exhausted. Colette comes in, still angry at Linguini. In an attempt to apologize, Linguini tries to confess his secret to Colette. Remy, desperate to remain hidden, forces Linguini forward so that he ends up kissing Colette. After a few seconds of hesitation, she reciprocates and a genuine attraction between the two begins.Food critic Anton Ego is in his study when he hears news of Gusteau's renewed popularity. Stunned, he vows to return there and find out what is truly going on.Skinner's lawyer returns to confirm Skinner's worst fear - Linguini is indeed Gusteau's son. Skinner decides not to tell Linguini and let the will's deadline (a mere 3 days away) pass - after which he can fire Linguini and suffer no ill effects.Later that night, Remy finds Emile with a few other rats outside the restaurant. When Remy goes inside to find the key to the food locker, he reads the documents and finds out about Linguini's parentage. Remy tries to take the documents, but Skinner spots him escaping again. Despite a thorough chase, Remy gets away and Linguini learns the truth. Skinner is fired, Linguini takes charge of the restaurant and the Gusteau frozen-food line is halted.At a press conference a few days later, Anton Ego introduces himself to Linguini and promises to come by the restaurant the next night to review Gusteau's once more.Linguini, growing arrogant, decides to try and work without Remy's help. In anger, Remy arranges for the rest of his rat-clan to raid the restaurant that night. Linguini finds out and throws all the rats out, including Remy.That evening, Remy and Emile are sniffing for food outside the restaurant when Remy runs into a trap. It turns out that the trap was set by Skinner. Skinner wants Remy to work for him creating new frozen foods.Ego arrives at the restaurant, and instead of ordering off the menu he challenges the chef to hit [him] with your best shot. Skinner, eager to see the downfall of Linguini, asks to have the same dish that Ego is served.Remy, still caged, is freed by his father and brother. Thankful, he returns to the restaurant to help Linguini. One of the chefs spots Remy returning and tries to kill the rat. But Linguini steps in and protects Remy, confessing the truth to everyone. The chefs, stunned, walk out - even Colette. Linguini thinks that there is no hope for Gusteau's.Django comes in and admits that he was wrong; seeing Linguini stand up for Remy has changed his attitude about humans. Django recruits the entire rat colony to help out - they will follow Remy's orders to prepare the food.Just then, a health inspector arrives and sees the kitchen full of rats. One group of rats swarms the inspector, tying him up and locking him in the freezer.Before long, the rats have formed an intricate system and are preparing all the meals for the restaurant. Linguini, knowing that someone will have to wait tables, puts on a pair of roller skates and begins serving the guests.Colette, having had a change of heart, returns to the restaurant to help Remy and Linguini. She asks what Remy wants to prepare for Ego. Remy selects ratatouille, an older-style recipe not traditionally up to the standards of Gusteau's (Colette calls it a peasant dish.) Soon enough, the entrée is prepared and served to Anton Ego.Ego takes a bite of the ratatouille, and immediately has a flashback to his childhood where his mother prepared the same dish to brighten his spirits after a bicycle accident. He is overwhelmed with emotion for the dish. Skinner, furious, storms into the kitchen - and is tied up and thrown into the freezer alongside the health inspector.Ego's heart is warmed by the fantastic meal, and insists on thanking the chef. Colette tells him that he must wait until all other customers have left. That evening, Ego learns the whole truth from Linguini, Colette and Remy. After leaving the restaurant, Ego writes a fantastic review for Gusteau's - proclaiming the chef to be the finest in Paris, while neglecting to reveal the chef's true identity.Unfortunately, the good fortune does not last. The health inspector and Skinner are freed; as a result, Gusteau's restaurant is shut down. And, as an effect, Ego loses his job and a great deal of credibility for promoting a rat-infested restaurant.Remy, telling this story to a few friends, states that Ego is now working as a small-business investor. It seems that Ego (along with Colette, Linguini and Remy) has opened a bistro named La Ratatouille where both humans and rats (in hidden, separate chambers) are both welcome.

title: Season of the Witch
synopsis: Season of the Witch opens to show an ancient tome being carefully hand-copied in an unknown location.In the Austrian town of Villach, in 1235 AD, at a bridge over the river, a priest (Nicholas Sidi) is presiding over the execution of three women accused of witchcraft-- a young woman, a middle-aged midwife, and an older spinster. All three are shackled at the wrists and feet with heavy iron manacles. As the terrified young woman begs and pleads for mercy, a noose is tightened around her neck and the priest tells all three women that they still have time to confess their sins, and their souls will be saved. In desperation, the young woman confesses to everything the priest demands. The midwife pleads that she only used pig's fat to make an ointment. The spinster, however, lifts her head slowly and tells the father that he will burn in hell. The outraged priest signals to the church soldiers, who grab the spinster and shove her over the bridge, followed by the midwife. The young woman then finds out that the priest promised her SOUL would be saved, but her body must be consigned to God. Her terrified pleas fall on deaf ears as she is pushed over the edge of the bridge and the noose breaks her neck.The soldiers then take the ropes and lower all three bodies down into the river. The priest protests that he must read passages from the Book of Solomon so the bodies do not rise again, but the soldier commander (Rory McCann) says that the three women are both hanged and drowned, and that's dead enough for him.At dusk, the priest pulls the three bodies up by the ropes himself, to get them back onto the bridge. He pulls up the young woman first and reads the ritual from the book. As he does this for the midwife, near the end of the ritual her body begins to convulse and choke, before once again becoming still and silent. As he starts to pull up the body of the spinster, he finds the rope suddenly pulling back. A sharp yank causes the priest to tumble over the bridge onto the river. Floundering in the water, he manages to get to shore when he feels his foot grabbed. Screaming and flailing wildly, he scrambles back to the bridge and rushes back to the book of Solomon, scrambling to turn to a different section. The body of the spinster shoots up out of the water and stands erect before the frightened priest. Her face contorts horribly as she thrusts a hand forward, and the book bursts into flame. The priest is then seen being hanged from the bridge.The camera pans out over a battlefield in the Gulf of Edremit, during the Crusades in 1332 AD. Two knights of the Church, Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman), wait to rush into battle, good-naturedly wagering on who can slay more infidels (loser buys drinks at the tavern). The two fight with unmatched zeal on the battlefield against the Turks, and are later shown carousing in the tavern with ale and women. Over the years, the two knights fight in many more battles: at Tripoli in 1334, Imbros in 1337, and Artah in 1339. But as the years and battles pass, both knights start to wonder just how many enemies God must have, and start to question who is truly commanding these wars... God, or their mortal Church superiors.Then, during a siege on the Turk fortress at Smyrna in 1344, Behmen, for once does not look before he strikes... and impaled on his sword is no Turk soldier, but a young Turk peasant woman who was not running into battle, but running for her life. He and Felson both stop and stare in disbelief at the true scope of the casualties. At the end of the siege, Behmen has it out with the Grandmaster (Brían F. O'Byrne) of the Church army over the slaughter of the helpless women and children. Finally disillusioned with everything they'd been fighting for, Behmen and Felson walk away and leave the Church army.A month later, Behmen and Felson are walking along the coast of Styria. While searching for food, they find their way to a farmhouse and hope to barter for a meal there. They find a horrible sight-- the farmer and his wife have died of a horrible illness; their bodies covered with flies. The farm otherwise untenanted, Behmen and Felson are able to fill their stomachs and take two horses for themselves, burning the farmhouse and the bodies so the illness does not spread.They arrive at a town. Felson worries that they will be recognized as Church deserters, but they cannot afford to ride past-- the horses are farm animals and cannot carry them much further. They have to barter the horses for provisions, food and perhaps proper riding horses.But inside the town, they quickly find the hand of death laying heavily upon it. The streets are clogged with the bodies of dead people being lain there as the remaining populace struggles with the task of burying or burning the corpses. A dreadful plague has gripped the village; wiping people out by the dozens. Three and a half years the pestilence has ravaged the countryside.Felson and Behmen are bartering with a stableman for fresh horses. But as a young stable boy picks up Behmen's bundle, Behmen's crusader sword falls out and onto the ground, its crest clearly visible. Behmen quickly grabs the bundle back up, but it is too late-- the stable master has seen the crest. As Behmen and Felson try to hurry out of the town, several soldiers corner them. Behmen and Felson fight, but are too severely outnumbered, and are captured and arrested. But as they are being escorted to the Church dungeon, a priest named Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore) asks to see Behmen's sword. Looking at the crest, he orders that Behmen and Felson follow him.Debelzaq brings the two men into the church temple, where they stand before Cardinal D'Ambroise (Christopher Lee), who is ill with the plague, being tended to by priests. D'Ambroise and Debelzaq say that the plague was brought about by a Black Witch, whose confession was heard by Debelzaq. D'Ambroise says that the witch must be brought to the Abbey of Severac, where the monks possess the last copy of a book of rituals that will destroy the witch's powers and thus end the plague. D'Ambroise wants Behmen and Felson to join Debelzaq and Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen), who is D'Ambroise's best knight, in escorting the Black Witch to Severac. When Behmen says he swore oath to God, but no longer serves the Church or its soldiers who murder in God's name, D'Ambroise and Debelzaq have them placed in the dungeon to await execution for desertion.In a cell across from Felson and Behmen is the accused Black Witch-- who, as she lifts her head to look at them, seems to Behmen to merely be a frightened young woman (Claire Foy). He brushes off the point that Debelzaq heard the Girl confess by mentioning that the Church can be most persuasive.Later that night, the Girl is seen briefly watching Behmen while he sleeps. Behmen is haunted by his memory of killing a peasant Turk woman at the Battle of Smyrna. Awakening from the dream, he sees the Girl accused of witchcraft sobbing fearfully as she lays in her cell across from him.Moved by compassion, Behmen calls for Debelzaq and tells him he will deliver the Girl to Severac. In return he wants a promise that she will be given a fair trial. Because Behmen is doing this in the interest of true justice, and not as a favor for the Church, they have no choice but to agree to his demand... and to Felson's term that he and Behmen are fully pardoned.Behmen and Felson are taken to the library and shown the travel route to Severac, which is six days' travel distance. The travel route is treacherous, passing across a river gorge, through a forest called Wormwood from which men have never found their way out of, and along a steep mountain pass... and Debelzaq is not familiar with the travel route. Behmen insists that a guide be hired or conscripted; a merchant or tax collector who travels and knows the areas along the route.Debelzaq (reluctantly) brings Behmen and Felson to a man named Hagamar (Stephen Graham), who is locked in a pillory for swindling Church officials; though of course, Hagamar insists he is innocent. Behmen, once again speaking as a knight, tells Hagamar that the bailiff of the town will issue him a full pardon if he guides the party escorting the Girl, to Severac. Behmen warns Hagamar that he will personally slay him if Hagamar tries to flee at any time.The party goes to the dungeon to retrieve the Girl and prepare her for transport. As the cell is unlocked, Debelzaq says that the Girl is unconscious, as the food she was given for her last meal was spiked with a powerful sedative. But as Debelzaq kneels over her and touches her neck, she springs up, seizing the priest by the throat, and shoving him down to the ground. Hearing Eckhart starting to draw his sword, the Girl turns and lunges at him, grabbing him by his own throat and throwing him down to the ground. Behmen manages to grab the Girl, though it takes Felson's aid for him to hold her fast. Hearing Debelzaq's voice, the Girl suddenly stops fighting long enough for Behmen to club her on the back of her head and knock her out.The Girl is placed in a cage built into a wagon which will be driven to the abbey. As the party sets out, townspeople curse at the Girl and throw offal at the cage. Meanwhile, at the Church temple, Cardinal D'Ambroise has died. A young soldier watches sadly as he is prepared for burial.As the escort party rides, Eckhart (who is driving the wagon) asks Debelzaq how he came across the Girl. Debelzaq found her wandering about Marburg, muttering strange and unintelligible words... and the plague came within a fortnight, and then to every village she passed. Eckhart is unconvinced that this makes her a witch, because he never saw the Girl pass by his own village, and yet the plague came just the same.Riding on horseback behind the wagon, Behmen and Felson talk. Though there is little if any other evidence to suggest that the Girl is a witch, Behmen cannot argue Felson's point that when she struggled with them, she displayed far greater physical strength than a girl her size and build should have. Of even greater concern at the moment, however, is that Felson has noted that the party is being followed.They set an ambush and corner the pursuer, ordering him off his horse. Behmen uses his sword to push down the pursuer's hood, revealing the face of the altar boy who was grieving over Cardinal D'Ambroise. The young man says his name is Kay (pronounced 'Kye,' played by Robert Sheehan), the son of a knight named Jurand, who fought at the battle of Imbros. Kay wants to come with the party to Severac, in the hopes that on the party's return, he will have a sponsor toward being knighted himself. Felson laughs mockingly at the request, seeing Kay as only an altar boy. This makes Kay speak defiantly in Felson's face; the argument reaching an impasse that can only be resolved by a duel, although Behmen requests that Felson use his off-hand and pull his blows; Behmen does not want Kay slain, but merely sent on his way.But although Kay is not Felson's equal in either swordplay or brute force, he fights with a valor that impresses Behmen; enough that he agrees to Kay joining the escort party.That night at camp, Behmen tells Kay tales of how he and Felson came to enlist in the Crusades. Later, Behmen goes to the Girl to bring her food and a blanket. Receiving them with gratitude, the Girl confides in Behmen that Debelzaq tortured her unmercifully before she confessed to him. She is frightened of Severac, telling Behmen of how another girl in her village was put on 'trial' for witchcraft: she was tied up, weighted down with stones and cast into a lake; because she did not drown, she was declared guilty and burned at the stake. Trying to comfort the Girl, Behmen promises that she will receive a fair trial. As Behmen returns to camp, Debelzaq tries to warn him that the witch is a deceiver who will turn men against one another.Later that night, Debelzaq's words seem to already begin to ring true. He goes to relieve Eckhart, who was watching over the Girl. As Eckhart watches her sleep, he speaks to Debelzaq about how much the Girl reminds him of his own daughter, Mila, who died from the plague (as he speaks, the Girl briefly opens one eye, showing she is awake and can hear the conversation). He is also concerned about the cardinal's promise to Behmen that the Girl would receive a fair trial: D'Ambroise also vowed to end the plague, and the town, so badly decimated by the pestilence and desperate for someone to blame, would riot if the Girl were to be found innocent. He is sure that the monks at Severac would decide based on what was best for the Church, instead of in the interest of justice, and Eckhart wants no further part of it.As Eckhart begins to return the camp, the Girl fearfully begs him not to leave her alone with Debelzaq. Quickly Eckhart notes that she is terrified of the priest and starts to approach her cage. But he gets too close and the Girl seizes him, pulling him against the bars of the cage. Without thinking, Debelzaq rushes to Eckhart's aid, but with cat-quick reflexes, the Girl releases Eckhart and grabs Debelzaq, grabbing a key to the cage from off of him and driving his cloak's pin clean through his hand. The rest of the party hears Debelzaq's screams and rushes out to recapture the Girl.The party tracks the Girl to a village decimated by the plague, and splits up to find her. As Kay and Eckhart pause at the site of a mass grave, Eckhart suddenly begins to hear his daughter Mila calling out to him and runs about in a desperate attempt to find her. Seeing Mila in front of him, Eckhart rushes toward her-- but it is in fact not Mila there, but a surprised Kay, who turned around just in time for Eckhart to impale himself on Kay's sword. Even as he dies, Eckhart thinks he sees Mila in front of him.As Behmen and Felson converge, they hear the Girl beginning to cry. Felson finds her, and she wrestles him to the ground. Behmen throws her off of him and she huddles against a wall, sobbing tearfully as she begs Behmen not to let Debelzaq touch her again.After giving Eckhart a Church burial, Debelzaq warns Behmen about the Girl, believing she killed Eckhart. He points out that she overheard Eckhart telling him about Mila, and that Kay noted that Eckhart's mind was not his own when he died. Debelzaq is most wary of any others in the party telling the Girl anything about themselves... for she will see the weaknesses in all of their hearts, and use these weaknesses against them. As they turn to look at the Girl, she glances at them curiously... but after Behmen turns to mount his horse, her expression toward Debelzaq changes to a thin, sly smile.The party rides along a mountainside road. The Girl speaks to Behmen as he rides behind the wagon, thanking him for his bravery and demeanor toward her. Her tone of voice with Behmen has changed from timid and wary to one of casual familiarity. When Behmen tells her that Debelzaq feels she killed Eckhart, she protests that Eckhart always treated her kindly, while Debelzaq has been anything but kind. Saying that she feels the pain in Behmen's heart over Eckhart's death, she stretches a hand out, offering to ease his pain. Behmen's face turns distrustful and she backs off and lays down.Meanwhile, Debelzaq is trying to soothe Kay's guilt, but the young soldier cannot be comforted. He holds himself responsible.The party arrives at a bridge they must cross; finding it dilapidated and rickety; unlike the last time Hagamar remembered crossing it-- eight or nine years ago. As Felson starts to question Hagamar's ability as a guide, Behmen starts to lead his horse across the bridge; testing its ability to bear both his and the horse's weight. The bridge sways, creaks and groans, but Behmen makes it across. He instructs the rest of the party to completely unload the wagon (except of course, for the Girl), and to bring the horses across first, one by one.Kay and Behmen begin pulling the wagon across, while Felson, Debelzaq and Hagamar hold a rope fastened to the rear of the wagon, gradually letting it out. Behmen and Kay are barely halfway across when the rough hemp rope abrades Delbezaq's hands until they are bloody and he is unable to hold on. Without his added pull and weight against the rope, Felson and Hagamar cannot hold on, causing the wagon to lurch uncontrollably across the bridge. Kay loses his balance and tumbles over the side of the bridge... but before he can fall, the Girl thrusts her hand through the bars of her cage and grasps his wrist, pulling Kay to safety-- with only one hand. The party hitches a rope from the horses to the wagon so they can pull it the rest of the way across; the party members pushing from behind. The bridge finally gives way under the stress, the party barely making it safely across with the wagon. As they pause to rest and bandage Debelzaq's hands, Hagamar notes that they are at the entrance to Wormwood Forest.As the party rides on, fog lays heavily upon the ground and Hagamar cannot see where they are going. Felson and Hagamar start to argue again when Behmen suggests they camp on the road until the fog passes. As camp is set up, Behmen goes to confront the Girl. Though she has displayed no other powers, Kay is now living proof of her incredible strength.The Girl's tone and face as she looks at Behmen have changed again, and she addresses him almost as if he were a friend, saying that people will believe what they want to believe. Addressing Behmen by name this time, she asks him if he believes she is a witch. As she speaks, the torch in Behmen's hands seems to abruptly go out, and then continue burning. In the brief second that his eyes were off the Girl, she has leaned against the bars, offering an amused smile as she asks if Behmen is afraid of her. Behmen pulls a tarp over her cage so they cannot see her, and she cannot look into their eyes. While asleep, Behmen has another dream of killing the peasant woman at Smyrna... but this time, as he remembers impaling her on his sword, he dreams that, instead of falling dead, she touches her fingers to her wound and tastes her blood, smiling pleasurably.Waking from the dream, Behmen finds Hagamar loading a crossbow; he is preparing to kill the Girl then and there, planning to deliver a cover story that she escaped from the cage and tried to attack them, and they had to kill her in self-defense. Behmen and Felson stop him, saying that even if nobody else could discern the deception of the story, Behmen and Felson themselves-- along with Debelzaq-- would always know and remember it.Abruptly a piercing ululation, sounding as if the Girl were howling, interrupts the argument. A more lupine howl comes from the forest, followed by another, and then more. The party knows that a pack of wolves is converging on them. Quickly they mobilize and stand in a formation that will let them cover each other's backs. The pack comes charging into the camp, but the party members defend themselves and each other, slaying the wolves.Then another chorus of howls comes from the forest and the party sees that the wolves are going to make another go for the camp, in even greater numbers. Behmen jumps to take the reins of the wagon while everyone else rides behind him. Chasing the party with determination, the pack of wolves succeeds in pulling down Hagamar's horse. As they surround Hagamar, their eyes and muzzles contort until they look horrific. Behmen and Felson start to ready their weapons, but the savage beasts are devouring Hagamar and they cannot save him. Taking back to flight again, they escape.The next day the party is riding again, when suddenly Behmen stops the wagon and grabs the crossbow. He has decided to kill the Girl himself and put an end to the party members dying. But of all the people to come to try and stop him, Debelzaq pleads with Behmen to stay his hand. Behind Debelzaq, the Girl smiles with seeming delight as she listens to Behmen rage at Debelzaq about how much more blood he's spilled in God's name, than he now believes God would ask him to do. Behman shoves Debelzaq aside, but now it is Felson standing before the cage. Felson gestures to one side, showing Behmen that they are at the edge of Wormwood Forest, and just before them is the mountain pass... and their destination, the Abbey of Severac, is in sight.Riding up to the abbey, Behmen knocks on the door for the outer gate. When nobody answers, Kay finally climbs through a window to open it from the inside. They ride through the outer cloister and Debelzaq says that judging by the time of day, they should find the monks in the chapel; they would be in vespers now.But on arrival, Debelzaq, Behmen, Felson and Kay find only death. The monks there are all dead from the plague. Debelzaq is distraught, as there is nowhere else to go. He drops to his knees and fervently begins to recite the Lord's prayer, when suddenly they hear a strained voice softly speak the last sentence. They find one monk on the floor, barely clinging to life. Debelzaq starts to give the dying monk last rites, when the monk shakily points to where Behmen sees the Book of Solomon resting on an altar. Debelzaq feels new hope as he skims through the pages.The party returns to the wagon, which they have left just outside the chapel gates; Debelzaq holding the Book of Solomon. At this point, all traces of timidity are gone from the Girl's voice and face, and she faces them with increasing boldness as she asks if this is the fair trial she was promised. Debelzaq sprinkles holy water at her, which makes her recoil, and begins the ritual. Smiling as she says she's deceived Debelzaq, the Girl then lashes out hatefully and begins to castigate the whole party on the Church's own sins and all the people it has hanged, burned and crucified.The Girl pauses to shoot a glance over her shoulder at the wagon's horses, who immediately respond with great agitation. She resumes her vitriol before Behmen tells Debelzaq to continue the ritual. As he begins reading, the girl briefly closes her eyes and mouths words. Debelzaq's injured hands begin to bleed and throb with pain. Behmen draws his sword and starts to advance on the Girl, who lashes out at his trying to help her only as a means of easing his own guilt. Behmen stops short on seeing she knew about his slaying the peasant Turk woman. The Girl's smile turns completely savage as she declares Behmen's own sins to be Legion in number; the countless souls that fell beneath his blade.Suddenly the Girl stands as erect as the cage will permit her and begins to bark the words of the Crusader Grandmaster during the battle of Smyrna-- her voice now mimicking that of the Grandmaster perfectly. Behmen and Felson stare in astonishment. Even without her voice having perfectly copied that of the Crusader Grandmaster, how she was able to know the exact words of his monologue should be impossible.Debelzaq's face turns in horror and he softly says that the Girl is in fact, no witch... he knows that she is something far more terrible. He hurriedly turns the pages of the Book of Solomon to one with a demonic image and the Latin word for exorcisms.As Debelzaq reads, the Girl turns, shrieking at him not to speak the words. Debelzaq starts to read the ritual more loudly, more strongly, and the Girl starts to scream and scramble about her cage. Winds begin to pick up; dark clouds blot out the sun. Slowly the Girl's face and body begin to change; revealing the demon that has possesed her. The demon grips the bars of the cage and they begin to melt, along with the roof and floor of the cage. Now free, the demon makes a beeline for Debelzaq; striking both Behmen and Felson aside like swatting at bugs. In desperation, Debelzaq grabs the goblet of holy water and hurls it at the demon, and it emits a horrible scream of agony. Kay rushes forward, sword at the ready, but the demon takes to the air and flees into the monastery.The party holes up in the abbey and gathers more holy water. Behmen tells Kay that his journey is ending here; the battle that must be undertaken now is beyond him. But Kay insists that his honor cannot be upheld unless he completes his vow to them, even if they try to release him from it... and even if it means his own death. Moved by Kay's valor and sense of duty, Behmen draws his sword, asks Kay to kneel and speak the vows of knighthood after him; upon which Behmen gives the accolade, using his authority as a knight to bestow knighthood on Kay.As the party goes through the abbey to confront the demon, they all reflect and think about their journey. The demon could have escaped at any time, but didn't. Kay realizes that escape was never the demon's plan. The party remembers that Eckhart died only after he began to express severe doubt over the Girl's guilt as a witch, and whether they truly needed to bring her to the abbey. Hagamar was killed by the wolves only after he wanted to kill the Girl immediately at the camp site in Wormwood. And reflecting further, they remember that when she struggled with them in her cell before the start of the journey, she suddenly stopped fighting, allowing them to render her unconscious when Debelzaq shouted that the sooner they got her to Severac, the better. Throughout the journey, she actually helped them-- even going so far as saving Kay's life. Putting these details together, the party realizes that the demon WANTED the party to deliver it to the abbey, even aiding them in reaching the destination safely.Making their way to the library, the party finds more bodies of monks that have succumbed to the plague. Behmen is puzzled to find that one monk, before dying, bound himself to the chair his corpse still sits in. More dead monks are found, similarly bound to their chairs in front of their desks. On the desks themselves are sheets of parchments containing passages from the Book of Solomon. Behmen and Debelzaq realize that the monks were making copies of the book, to arm the rest of Europe against evil, heresy and witchcraft. This gives them the answer as to why the demon wanted to come here to the abbey: it knew that a suspected witch would be brought here, where the last copy of the Book of Solomon was kept. The demon's goal, all along, has been to destroy the last copy of the book before more copies were finished. It would have free, unopposed reign over all of Europe, and usher in an age of darkness.The demon (now voiced by Kevin Killebrew) speaks directly to them then, dryly thanking them for bringing it to the abbey and the book before it. They see the demon in its true form perched on the domed ceiling of the abbey library.Abruptly the papers on all the desks burst into flame and begin to burn. The increased illumination from these small fires allows Felson to note something terribly disturbing... all the bodies of the dead monks are now gone.Debelzaq starts to continue reading the ritual. The demon growls and causes a stone banister above them to crumble and crash down on their heads. Then, the party notes, the dead bodies of the monks are now animated, under the demon's command. The dead monks quickly scuttle along the walls and ceiling of the library, dropping down on them to kill them.Fighting to destroy these animated corpses, and to defend Debelzaq as he continues the exorcism ritual, the party finds that cutting the heads off of the corpses causes them to dissipate. But the last body drops from the ceiling right on Felson's back, driving a knife into it. Felson destroys the last dead monk, but is grievously wounded.Suddenly the demon itself descends from the chapel dome. In the fighting, Debelzaq was now unguarded. Seizing Debelzaq from above and behind, the demon snaps his neck and kills him. It tries to grab the book to destroy it, but the holy writing on the pages burns its hand. Behmen rushes at the demon, but it grabs Behmen by the throat and pins him against the wall, hissing how the book has tormented it over centuries as it worked tirelessly to destroy all the copies, and this was the last one. The demon throttles Behmen harder, about to finish him, when suddenly Felson grabs the demon from behind, saying to Behmen, 'you'll be buying tonight, my friend.'Felson drags the demon away from Behmen, but he is no match for the demon's physical strength or unholy powers. Enveloping Felson in its wings, the demon burns Felson alive, turning his body into ash.The demon's head whirls around at the sound of Latin incantations; Kay has picked up the book and has picked up the ritual where Debelazaq left off. Enraged, it turns to face the young knight, when Behmen charges at the demon, shoving it against the wall, driving two daggers through the demon's wings to pin it. Struggling with all his strength, Behmen shouts for Kay to finish the ritual. As the young knight recites with renewed conviction, the demon begins to shriek loudly and fight with maniacal fury. Arcing one wing around, the demon uses a barb along the wing's edge, stabbing Behmen in the back. It drives the barb into Behmen's back again and again, ripping Behmen apart from the inside out. Finally Behmen is mortally wounded, and the demon bats him aside and pulls the knives out of its wings, turning to face its last opponent... but Kay has finished reading the exorcism ritual with a loud, forceful Amen. The demon is halted in its tracks; the holy power invoked wracking the demon with great pain, finally destroying it; the horrific unholy creature's body becoming a ball of energy that dissipates through the domed ceiling. Quickly the sky begins to clear.The battle won, Kay slumps in a daze against a wall while the Girl lays naked and barely conscious nearby. Kay crosses to Behmen. With his dying breath, Behmen asks Kay to watch over and protect the Girl.Kay provides proper Church burial for his fallen compatriots, building stone barrows into which are set Felson and Behmen's swords and a wooden cross as grave markers. The Girl stands beside him, musing how she owes so much to those that she never truly knew, and she doesn't know what to say. Kay suggests she say what is in her heart.The Girl tells the slain knights that her name is Anna, and she will never forget everything they did for her; how they gave their lives on her behalf. She asks Kay to tell her everything he knows about Behmen, Felson and Debelzaq, as she and Kay mount horses for the journey home. We see the Book of Solomon in Kay's saddle bag; he is now the keeper of the words of Solomon. The camera begins to pan out as Kay and Anna ride back to civilization.Anna closes the movie with a voiceover in which she recounts that the plague lifted from the land like the passing of a fever, and she promises to devote her life to telling her story, that the horrors faced and the lives lost will always be remembered and that people will be reminded that they, and the darkness that almost was, were all very real.

title: Batman: Mask of the Phantasm
synopsis: A meeting between crime lord Chuckie Sol (Dick Miller) and his cronies starts one night in Gotham City. Sol is instructing his men about the procedure for laundering some new counterfeit bills through their casino when the meeting is interrupted by the Batman. Batman takes out Sols' followers but Chuckie manages to get to the parking garage.Sol is greeted by a mysterious figure (who he first mistakes for Batman) stating the phrase Your Angel of Death awaits. This mysterious Phantasm (voiced by Stacey Keach) is nearly run down by Sol's car, but tricks Sol into driving out a nearby window to his death. Batman arrives on the scene and observes Sol; the people below see Batman and assume he is responsible for what has happened.Next morning, Councilman Arthur Reeves (Hart Bochner) is giving a press conference about Batman's apparent actions. He wants to hunt down Batman and arrest the vigilante. Commissioner James Gordon (Bob Hastings) is against it, since he doesn't believe Batman would do something like that. Detective Harvey Bullock (Robert Costanzo), on the other hand, is in favor of stopping Batman.Alfred (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and Bruce (Kevin Conroy) are watching the presentation in the Batcave. Batman is analyzing a chemical found on the glass from Chuckie Sol's car.Councilman Arthur is in his office, talking to a woman (Dana Delany) on the phone. She's flying into town after being gone for 10 years to settle some old finances.During a party at Wayne Manor, Bruce confronts Arthur about his Batman stance. Arthur counters with some remarks about Bruce's love life, and mentions the name of one woman from Bruce's past- Andrea Beaumont.Bruce confronts the portrait of his parents, flashing back to his memory of meeting Andrea in the graveyard while they both visited dead relatives (Andrea with her mother, Bruce with his parents). They both talk about how they miss their families. Bruce slyly mentions that he made a vow to his parents upon their death, and that so far he has kept it.The night after meeting Andrea, Bruce goes out crime-fighting for the first time in his life. Decked out in a simple mask and street clothes, he confronts a group of thieves. Bruce is able to fend them off, but the thieves do not treat him as a serious threat.Next morning, after bandaging his wounds, Bruce exercises while talking to Alfred. Bruce thinks that he failed to keep control of the situation because the criminals weren't afraid of him. Andrea arrives to speak with Bruce, and before long the two have begun a romantic relationship. The flashback ends and Bruce goes back out to the party.Another Gotham crime lord, Buzz Bronski (John P. Ryan) visits the grave of Chuckie Sol. He hears the mysterious voice repeating Your Angel of Death Awaits- the Phantasm has come for Bronski. Phantasm kills Bronski by pushing a huge stone angel onto him. Buzz's bodyguards see a caped figure walking away from the scene and assume it is the Batman.Elderly crime boss Salvatore Valestra (Abe Vigoda) reads the obituary of Buzz Bronski and the news story about Batman being thought responsible for the crimes. He is shocked at the news.Arthur is now more fanatical than ever in his crusade against Batman. Commissioner Gordon vehemently refuses to participate, so Bullock eagerly steps up.After Batman collects evidence at the scene of Buzz Bronski's murder, he takes a brief moment to reflect at the graveside of his parents. Andrea Beaumont is also in the graveyard; she spots a figure at the Wayne graves and automatically assumes that it is Bruce.Andrea has dinner with Councilman Reeves, her mind distracted by what she saw that night. Batman observes her on stakeout. This triggers another flashback- Bruce takes Andrea to the Gotham World Fair, observing several prototype inventions- including a distinctive looking car. Andrea invites Bruce to come and meet her father, and he agrees. Bruce voices his discomfort to Alfred; his relationship with Andrea wasn't something he's planned on.Bruce & Andrea greet Carl Beaumont, who is just finishing business with Arthur Reeves (Reeves works for Beaumont's legal department at this time). The meeting is interrupted by Valestra, who wants to speak with Carl. Both Bruce & Andrea are suspicious of Valestra.Bruce spots a street merchant being robbed by a motorcycle gang. He goes after them, but his concern for Andrea distracts him and they get away.That night, Bruce tries to design a costume for himself but cannot continue. Bruce knows that he can't complete the vow he made to his parents with someone like Andrea in his life. Bruce goes to his parents' grave site to try and justify his feelings. Andrea meets him and they go home together.When a police helicopter approaches the nearby roof, Batman is brought out of his memory trip and returns home.Next day, Councilman Reeves is approached by Valestra. Reeves confirms that Batman is apparently attacking their people.Using the Bat-Computer, Batman confirms that the two dead men- Sol & Bronski- were partners in phony dummy corporations set up at least 10 years ago. There was a third man involved- Sal Valestra. Batman goes off to confront Valestra. Alfred asks if Bruce will see Andrea when he is done.In Valestra's office, Batman finds a photo of Carl Beaumont with Valestra and the two dead men. This triggers yet another flashback- Bruce proposes to Andrea and she happily accepts. They are interrupted by a huge swarm of bats coming from a cave below the house. Andrea returns to her father's house to see that some people have arrived to speak with Carl. She goes inside to tell her father the good news.Bruce explores the cave and marvels at its huge size. When he returns, Alfred solemnly hands him a package. Andrea has returned Bruce's ring, stating only that she is leaving town and encouraging Bruce to forget her. Bruce, heartbroken, throws himself back into The Plan. That very night, he dons the Batsuit for the first time. Alfred, seeing the transformation from Bruce to Batman, can only watch and remark My God!Valestra goes to the now abandoned World Fair, which is a hideout for the Joker (Mark Hamil), who greets him like an old friend. Valestra tells him that he thinks Batman is killing off members of the old gang. Joker notes that this is uncharacteristic behavior for Batman, and insists he is not a hired gun for the mob. Valestra reminds him that if the vigilante is specifically targeting his old associates, then its only a matter of time before they go after the Joker.Andrea ends her date with Arthur, and finds Batman in her room. He asks about the men photographed with her father, but she tells him nothing. Denying any connection, Andrea states that Batman is the only one there who is still controlled by his parents.The Phantasm comes to Valestra's apartment, only to find that Sal has been given a lethal dose of Joker toxin. Joker, watching from a hidden camera, is shocked to see that the killer isn't really Batman. The Phantasm narrowly escapes a bomb set by the Joker.Batman confronts the Phantasm on the rooftop. A police helicopter confronts Batman, and Phantasm uses the chance to escape. Batman hides out in a construction site, but is soon able to trick the police into attacking a phony target (losing his cape & cowl in the process). Andrea drives up as Batman is fleeing and offers him a getaway vehicle. They elude the police.Alfred bandages Bruce's wounds while he talks to Andrea. She tells Bruce about what happened the night he proposed. A flashback reveals that Carl Beaumont is begging for his life in front of Valestra's men. Andrea walks in, and her life is jeopardized too. Valestra gives Carl 24 hours to return the money that was embezzled or Carl will die. Andrea opposes her fathers actions and does not wish to run, but Carl insists that there is no hope for them in Gotham.In the present, Andrea tells Bruce that her father was eventually able to pay off his debt, but Valestra's men considered it too little, too late. Bruce thinks that the man in the Phantasm costume is Carl- killing off the gangsters to finally be free of his debt. Bruce & Andrea are obviously still in love, but Bruce states that he still has to stop the Phantasm.Bruce looks at the photo he took from Valestra again. He recognizes the features on one man, and-after an alteration with red ink- confirms that Valestra's former bodyguard is actually The Joker!Councilman Reeves is furious that Batman escaped. The Joker confronts Reeves and talks about what's been happening, mentioning that someone other than Batman is responsible for the killings. Joker doses Reeves with his laughing toxin, and Arthur is hospitalized in a hysterical laughing fit.Batman confronts Reeves that night, confirming the details about Reeve's connection to the Beaumonts. Arthur kept in touch with Carl while he was abroad, helping to set up funds. But when Reeves asked Carl for help in financing an election, Carl refused. So, desperate for funds, Arthur sold Carl out to Valestra's mob.Batman searches Andrea's apartment for more clues, finding a locket with a picture of Andrea & himself inside. The phone rings and Batman answers it- it's the Joker, sending another bomb into the apartment. Batman manages to escape and recognizes the design of the plane that flew in the bomb. He deduces that Joker is hiding out in the ruins of the Gotham World Fair.In a final flashback, Andrea returns to her father's new home after some grocery shopping, only to find Valestra's bodyguard emerging. Fearing the worst, she drops the grocery bags and runs. As Andrea screams in horror, the future Joker grabs an apple out of the discarded grocery bags, then casually walks away.Phantasm confronts Joker, and Joker applauds the Phantasm's scheme. Phantasm is revealed to be Andrea Beaumont, out for revenge against her father's murderers. Batman arrives and confronts Andrea, who states that vengeance is now all that she has left. Batman and Joker fight, eventually triggering a fire in the World's Fair props. Andrea grabs Joker, vowing that her crusade will end no matter what. She disappears in an explosion, but Batman manages to get away.In the Batcave, Bruce regrets not being able to save Andrea. Alfred states that it is quite possible Andrea didn't want to be saved. A glimmer in the cave attracts Bruce's attention- he finds the same locket from Andrea's apartment.Out on a cruise, Andrea gazes out at the sea, truly alone in the world.

title: Twelve Monkeys
synopsis: The time is the indeterminate future. A virus, deliberately released in 1996 in multiple locations around the world, has killed off five billion people. Survivors have established an elaborate underground civilization because the earth's surface is considered uninhabitable by humans. From time to time prisoners volunteer to don protective gear and gather specimens of insects from the surface to test for the presence of the virus.One such prisoner is James Cole, who after retrieving samples is given the chance to go back in time to 1996 and find information about the group believed responsible, known as The Army of 12 Monkeys. Throughout the ensuing episodes, Cole finds himself remembering, as if in dreams, various things that he witnessed as a child, including the killing of a man in an airport. This persists as a theme throughout the film.Miscalculation sends Cole to 1990, and he finds himself incarcerated in an insane asylum. His psychiatrist, Kathryn Railly, thinks she has met him before, but his ravings are incoherent to her. Eventually Cole is sent to an insane asylum where he is locked up with other lunatics. There he meets Jeffrey Goines, who is definitely off the wall, but who tries to help him escape, handing him a key to the day room. Cole is quickly recaptured and restrained in an isolation room. When Railly & her boss, Dr Fletcher, enter the room to check on Cole, he has vanished, snatched back to his present time by the scientists who sent him there. He is interrogated and given a second chance to complete his mission. A second miscalculation sends him to the battlefields of World War I, where he is wounded in the leg. As he crawls around naked and in pain from his wound, he is suddenly propelled into the future.Arriving in 1996, Cole kidnaps Dr. Railly and tries to convince her that he is from the future. He finds that Jeffrey Goines, whose father is a famous virologist, is now out of the asylum, working for his father, and has formed The Army of 12 Monkeys. Cole is now racing against time, and after a few mishaps, finally decides that he wants to stay in 1996 with Dr. Railly, surrendering to the inevitable destruction of human life.They travel to Philadelphia, eventually finding a shabby storefront, the headquarters of Jeffrey Goines' Army of the 12 Monkeys. The organization claims they've severed their ties with Jeffrey because he'd become too unpredictable and radical.By this time, Dr. Railly has become convinced that somehow Cole knows something--his predictions of the outcome of minor events is too uncanny. The discovery of a World War I bullet in Cole's leg forces her to check a photograph from her own research, taken on the battlefield which, impossibly, shows Cole in the trenches. She becomes convinced that The Army of 12 Monkeys indeed poses a threat, and she persuades Cole to take up his cause again.They travel to Jeffrey's father's mansion where Cole ties her up and leaves her in the woods. In the middle of a fundraising dinner, Cole meets with Jeffrey. Jeffrey rambles about how Cole had given him the idea to release a virus that would destroy most of humanity. Cole leaves, chased by security from the mansion and finds Railly in the woods. While he rants about wanting to stay in Railly's time, he suddenly disappears.Railly continues her investigation of the clues Cole was collecting and makes her way to a shabby storefront in the western district of Philadelphia she believes is the headquarters for the Army of the 12 Monkeys. While she pounds on their door, Cole suddenly appears. He's now convinced himself that he is delusional and wants Railly to help him. Inside the storefront, Jeffrey is rambling about how Railly found him, that she must have processed his thoughts through a complex computer system to predict his next location. He and his loyal followers leave with him to carry out their plans.An essential element in the communication between Cole's past and present is a telephone number where he can leave a message for the scientists of his own present. When Goines and his Army release all the animals in the zoo to roam the streets of New York, and then posts flyers declaring We did it! Cole realizes that the Army is not the threat, and he leaves a phone message to that effect. Shortly after, Jose, a fellow volunteer from the present, approaches Cole with orders for him to complete his mission and hands him a revolver. Cole initially refuses, but then notices a guard from the present glaring at him. Jose makes it clear Dr Railly will be killed if Cole does not comply.Meanwhile, the police are after Cole for kidnapping Dr. Railly. In an airport, while attempting with Cole to elude capture, Dr. Railly recognizes Dr Peters, a man who worked with Jeffrey Goines's father in the virology lab and an apocalypse nut. She rushes to inform Cole of this and frantically identifies him, along with his travel plans, with Jose overhearing this. The man goes through airport screening and manages to persuade security that his biological samples--one for each of the many cities on his itinerary--are harmless. Dr. Railly alerts Cole, and they attempt to stop the man. To Dr. Railly's horror, Cole is shot by the police while chasing the real perpetrator, who escapes to board his plane. Cole's death is witnessed by a boy named James, who is with his parents: the young Cole.On the plane, Peters takes his seat and starts a conversation with his fellow passenger. We recognize her as the woman lead scientist from Cole's present. Cole had stated once the virus was located, a scientist would be sent back to study it in its original unmutated form, so that a cure could be developed in the present. She identifies herself as Jones and cryptically says she's in insurance.

title: The Presence
synopsis: The film opens with images of a foggy river running through a densely wooded area. Next to the river, theres a quiet, empty cabin. Each room of the cabin is silent and still. A man (Shane West) in a white long sleeve shirt is standing silently staring out a window. Theres a dock to the river outside the cabin. The man is then at the kitchen table, staring silently outside. Music on an old record player is playing while the man is sitting in the living room in the dark.In the morning, the man is staring out the window. Theres a storm outside. A crash of thunder and a loud bang sound throughout the empty cabin. The bang catches the mans attention. The front door is open and he stares at it. The door behind him flings open and a figure in a rain poncho walks through the living room. Its a woman (Mira Sorvino). She doesnt see the man because he is a Ghost. She hangs up her raincoat in a closet and closes the door. She then opens the door again and steps back. The door closes on its own and The Woman smiles. The Ghost is standing in the corner of the room watching her with a furrowed brow. She walks through the house with her bags and goes into a bedroom and starts to unpack. She looks at old black and white photos sitting on a dresser. She then goes to the kitchen and lights a gas lantern. She pumps water into the sink, fills a kettle, and puts it on the wood burning stove. She starts to unpack some groceries and reaches into a high cupboard and pulls out a bottle of alcohol that she knew was there. She smiles, uncorks it, smells it smiling, and sets it on the counter. She then notices a coffee mug on the kitchen table, picks it up, and blows dust off it. The tea kettle whistles. We see a meadow at sunset. The Woman is at the kitchen table with a lantern having dinner and a glass of wine. She finishes her meal and takes her dishes to the sink. Through the kitchen window, we see the Ghost slowly appear behind her, watching her with a furrowed brow.In the morning, theres a rainbow over the river. The Woman leaves the cabin and takes a motorboat down the river. We next see her back at the cabin. Shes walking outside and we see the Ghost standing at a window watching her. She goes to an outhouse in the woods. She looks at the outhouse and pauses. She picks up a stick and goes in the outhouse. We hear banging from inside the outhouse and then silence. A bird then flies into the side of the outhouse and dies. The Woman comes out slowly with the stick, looks around the side, and sees the dead bird. She kneels and touches it gently. We then see the Ghost looking out the window, watching her as she digs a small hole and places the bird gently in the grave. He looks less angry as he watches her.Its nighttime and The Woman is sitting in the living room listening to a record. The windup record player slowly stops playing. The Ghost is sitting across from her watching her. She puts out the fire and takes the lantern upstairs. The Woman gets in bed and blows out the lantern. The record then suddenly starts playing on its own. The Woman relights the lantern and slowly walks downstairs. She goes into the living room. The Ghost is sitting by the record player. She shuts off the record and goes back to bed.In the morning, The Woman is arranging books on the table and opens a notebook to start writing when she hears a boat. The Ghost is standing in the doorway. She stands to look outside and sees a boat coming towards the dock. The Ghost and The Woman each stand at a window and watch the approaching boat. The Woman heads downstairs and walks down the dock. An old man (Muse Watson) gets out of the boat with a box of groceries while a young man in a black hooded sweater (Adam Croce) waits in the boat. The Woman asks Mr. Browman if he would like some coffee, but he declines and says he needs to get back to the store. He asks her if shes okay in the cabin. She happily says she is. He says hed be scared to be there and she says shell be fine. He says its creepy and she insists shell be fine. He says okay and then tells her he brought her some fresh chickens and tells her to keep them in the shed because the weather is cold enough to make the shed like a refrigerator. She thanks him. The Ghost in the house watches as the storeowner gets back in the boat and leaves. We next see The Woman taking the chickens out to the shed. She walks in and leaves the door open. A shadow forms on the wall outside of the shed and the door slams shut startling The Woman. She goes to the door and looks out the window as the shadow recedes. She tries to open the door but struggles with it for a few moments before it opens. She steps out panting and nervous.The woods and river are quiet as it starts to rain. The Woman is inside and notices a bookcase open. She shuts it and starts to walk away when she kicks a book that somehow ended up on the floor in the middle of the room. She picks it up and looks back at the case wondering how it got there. She opens the book The Complete Outdoorsmans Handbook and flips through the pages. In the book is an old newspaper clipping. She pulls it out and reads the headline Escaped Criminal Drowns: Man accused of murder found dead in Piken Lake. She puts the clipping back in the book.We next see The Woman that night lying in bed biting her fingernail. The Ghost is in the bedroom watching her as she blows out the lantern. The next morning, The Woman is startled awake and opens her eyes quickly. The Ghost is lying next to her staring her in the face. She quickly gets out of bed and looks around the room. The Ghost, still lying on the bed, watches her. She gets dressed and leaves the room. She sits at the kitchen table with a steaming mug, then goes into the living room and gets her cell phone from her purse. She takes it outside and makes a call asking for Mr. Browman. He isnt there, but she leaves a message that shes just checking in. She goes back in the cabin and puts her phone back in the purse. She then leaves the cabin wearing a heavy coat. The Ghost is standing at the door and looks as though he wants to follow her but cant. She walks through the dense woods and goes to the outhouse, again taking a stick in with her. We hear banging and then silence. Once again, a bird flies into the side of the outhouse and dies.The Ghost is looking out a window at a storm when the record player starts. He is then in the living room looking at the record player with a furrowed brow. Behind him, The Woman is also staring at the record player looking nervous. Neither of them turned it on. The front door then bangs open startling The Woman. A man (Justin Kirk) walks in and she hugs him. The Man is happy to see that she isnt angry at him for coming unannounced. The record player slowly stops playing. The Woman takes his coat and The Man tells her that Mr. Browman brought him to the island. The Man comments that Mr. Browman told him that there had been a storm the day shed arrived to the island as well. He looks around the cabin and asks her about the summers shed spent there as a child. He asks her to show him around and then points out the record player. She brushes it off and takes the record off the turntable. She suggests they unpack his bags and he says theres no hurry and says she can show him around first. He asks her if shes okay and she nods. They hug and The Man tells The Woman that hes missed her. Then he whispers in her ear and she laughs. They lie down on the couch and hold each other and laugh. The Ghost is upstairs listening to them.Later that day, the storm stops and The Woman shows The Man around the cabin. She takes him into her bedroom and tells him he can unpack. She tells him about her childhood summers at the cabin with her family. She talks about playing hide-and-seek and tells him she had the best hiding place on the entire island and offers to show it to him sometime. He pulls out a bottle of wine from his bag and she says theyll have it with dinner. They kiss and then The Man notices the black and white pictures on the dresser and asks if the people are her grandparents. She says yes and The Man comments that her grandmother was beautiful. The Woman says that her grandmother meant the world to her and tells The Man that her grandfather bought the cabin because her grandmother wanted it and that her grandfather hardly ever came to the cabin. The Man comments that she never talks about her grandfather. The Woman says that there isnt a need to because he wasnt a good guy. The Man asks, Like your dad? The Woman considers for a moment and says, Sure. She turns and walks away.That night, over dinner, The Man is telling The Woman about a party shed missed and says he wished shed been there. She says she needed to be at the cabin. He says he just likes having her around, and The Woman says that hell get a lot of her at the cabin. He says he hopes that it was okay that he came to the island.That night, in the dark, The Man wakes up The Woman and says he needs to go to the bathroom. She jokingly says, I told you to go before we went to bed, young man. She lights the lantern and gives it to him telling him to pee off the porch. He says thats not what he needs to do. She gives him directions to follow the path to the outhouse and he asks if shell walk him out there. She smiles at him and closes her eyes. He gets out of bed and the Ghost is standing next to the bed watching them. Before The Man leaves, The Woman tells him to use a stick to get rid of the spiders on the seat. The Man follows the path, sees the outhouse, and says, Youve got to be kidding me. He picks up a stick and goes inside. He closes the door and bangs the stick around the seat multiple times. He sits down to relieve himself and the lantern falls and breaks leaving him in the dark. Then the outhouse starts to shake and bang. He runs from the outhouse as a dense fog begins to roll in. He gets back in bed and wraps his arms around The Woman. She asks if it went okay but he doesnt answer.The next morning, The Woman takes The Man to see her favorite hiding spot. She shows him the small window that leads to the crawl space under the house. She says she sometimes used to go in there even when they werent playing hide-and-seek and that it was a good place to be alone. He seems surprised and asks if she got scared down there. She says no, that it stayed cool in there during the summer and she enjoyed listening to her grandmother move around the kitchen. The Woman says she felt safe there. She then asks The Man about his visit to the outhouse the night before. He sighs and shakes his head and she asks if he was scared. He says, Cmon, youve seen that place. She agrees and says thats why she doesnt go there in the dark. The Man says it wouldnt have been so bad if it hadnt been for all the banging. The Woman looks startled. The Man says it was from tree branches banging against the walls from the wind.They go for a walk around the island. The Woman shows The Man a great view from a cliff and tells him its another of her secret places. He says its beautiful and then says shes beautiful. He tells her that their 3 years together have been the best of his life. He says that he knows she has doubts and he understands why, but he doesnt have any doubts. He says he wants to spend his life with her and start a family with her. He pulls a ring box from his pocket and asks her to marry him. She pauses and looks unsure. He says hes not like the men from her family, he knows that its hard for her to believe that hes a good man, and he assures her that she can trust him and have faith in him. She doesnt respond, so he closes the ring box, takes her hand, gives it to her, and asks her to think about it. They hug for a moment and then suddenly theres a whisper and the edge of the cliff gives way beneath his feet. The Man falls over the edge, but The Woman grabs his arms and helps him back onto the cliff. They lie down next to each other panting and then start to laugh. She tells him she loves him and then says shell marry him. They kiss and he asks if anybody has made love on the cliff before. The Woman laughs and then sits up in a panic looking for the ring. Shed had it in her hand when The Man fell and she doesnt know where it went. After an unsuccessful search, they go back to the cabin. She apologizes for losing the ring and The Man says its okay, she was saving his life. He hugs her and she apologizes again.Later that day, The Man is taking a nap and The Woman is outside on a bench with a book in her lap. The Ghost is in the bedroom watching The Man sleep when he hears whispering. The Ghost is then in the living room looking out the window where The Woman is now asleep on the bench. The Ghost doesnt know where the whispering is coming from. A little later, The Man wakes up from his nap and calls for his girlfriend. He finds her outside on the bench reading and comments that its cold outside. The Woman aloofly replies that shes fine. The Man asks her why she didnt wake him up and she responds without looking at him that she thought he needed sleep. The Man asks if theyre going to eat and The Woman responds that shes going to keep working and she still doesnt look at him. The Man asks if shell help him light the stove since he hasnt done it before. The Woman finally looks at him and says coldly, If you want to be here, you have to take care of yourself. Its not that hard. The Man looks hurt and goes back inside. In the kitchen, hes preparing to light the stove when The Woman comes in and helps him.The next morning, The Woman brings a mug to The Man in bed and says its a peace offering and apologizes for her behavior the night before. The Man tells her its okay and offers to leave so she can do her work alone, saying he can go when the storeowner comes back to the island. She says no and tells him shes glad hes there. In the kitchen, The Man is helping The Woman with the dishes. She thanks him for helping and he jokes that hed make a good wife. The Woman laughs. The Man says hes going to go explore the island and leave her to her work, and that hell make dinner when he gets back. He jokes that the stove might get the best of him and The Woman asks if hed like her help lighting it. The Man says no and tells her that hes watched her do it and he can figure it out. He leaves to explore the island and walks past the Ghost whos standing in the corner with his fists clenched and his brow furrowed.When The Man comes back from his walk, he has wildflowers for The Woman. She smiles and he asks her about her day. She says shes having trouble getting focused and asks him about his walk. He says he took the worlds longest hike and comments that the island is a lot bigger than he thought. He tells her that hes about to start dinner and jokingly says that it will be ready in about five hours. She thanks him for the flowers and he goes downstairs.The Ghost is watching The Man in the kitchen making dinner when he hears the whispering again. He looks around him and then looks up to the ceiling when he realizes the whispering is coming from upstairs. The Ghost walks up the stairs and peers around the corner to see a man in a black suit (Tony Curran) kneeling beside The Woman whispering in her ear. Only bits of what hes saying can be heard: What hell do to you disgusting it makes you sick, doesnt it? It makes me sick too. The Woman looks upset as shes working. As The Man in Black is speaking, he turns and looks at the Ghost smiling maliciously. The Ghost steps back into the hallway. The whispering stops and the Ghost peers back into the room. The Woman is alone. When the Ghost steps back into the hall, The Man in Black is behind him and quietly says, Boo. When the Ghost spins around, The Man in Black is not there. The Ghost looks frightened.That evening, The Man goes upstairs and enthusiastically tells the Woman that dinner is ready. She doesnt look up. The Man tells her that he made spaghetti and he thinks its pretty good. The Woman stonily tells him that shes going to keep working. The Man laughs uncomfortably and starts to object. The Woman says that she has to keep working and thats why she came to the cabin. The Man says, Right, I just thought and The Woman cuts him off and cruelly says, Its not fair of you to keep asking me to spend time with you when I didnt even want you here. The Man asks her what happened. She yells at him to just leave her alone. The Man is hurt and walks back downstairs alone. Later that night, The Man is awake in bed when The Woman gets in bed. Their backs are to each other and neither speaks. The Ghost is in the room facing the window but looking at them over his shoulder.The next morning, The Man takes a mug outside to The Woman who is sitting on the bench. He offers her the coffee and she doesnt look at him. He sits next to her and gives her the mug. He says he did alright with the coffee and that hes getting pretty good in the kitchen. She doesnt drink the coffee. The Man puts his hand on her knee and she moves away and quickly stands up saying she needs to get started on her work. She goes inside, leaving The Man alone on the bench, and walks past the Ghost who is in the living room looking out the window.Suddenly The Man in Black is behind the Ghost. The Man in Black says, See how easy it can be? The Man in Black tell the Ghost that it wouldn't take much for The Woman to be his. The Ghost looks away from him. The Man in Black says to the Ghost, I know youve thought about it. Ive watched you. As they look out the window at The Man on the bench, The Man in Black asks the Ghost, But then, what can you do? The Ghost disappears leaving The Man in Black in the living room. In the kitchen, the Ghost is looking out the window. The Man in Black is behind him and taunting him that he can't have The Woman. The Ghost spins around and looks at The Man in Black. The Man in Black asks the Ghost. Why would you even try? The Ghost disappears again. The Man in Black looks up to ceiling. The Ghost is upstairs. The Man in Black is again behind the Ghost and says, You cant do much of anything really. The Ghost spins around and looks at him. The Man in Black tells the Ghost that he could have many things, pleasures that hes been denied for a long time. The Man in Black holds up a cigarette and says that the Ghost can enjoy old vices that can no longer harm him. The Ghost is listening to The Man in Black. The Man in Black says, Escape from this place, and approaches the Ghost. The Man in Black tells him that his eternity is only just beginning. He asks if he really wants to spend eternity trapped in the cabin. The Man in Black says, Imagine being anywhere you want any time. Freedom. The Man in Black smiles at the Ghost before continuing. Or, he says putting his arm around the Ghosts shoulders, would you rather spend it even in a different way. The Man in Black looks into the hallway. The Woman is slowly walking out of a room and goes to the stairs. She looks over the rail. The Man in Black looks at the Ghost and says, I can give you many things. Then, whispering, The Man in Black says, I can give you everything. The Man in Black disappears and the Ghost is alone in the room. The voice of The Man in Black says, Its your choice.That night, The Man and the Woman are having dinner in the kitchen. They arent speaking to each other, but there is whispering. The Ghost watches The Man in Black kneeling between the couple whispering to them. The Man in Black says to The Woman, Hes going to molest your children. You have to see that. The Man in Black leans to The Man and says, You have to understand that she does not want any commitment at all. The Ghost is listening to The Man in Black as he whispers. The Man in Black turns and looks at the Ghost and says, Easy. The Ghost looks uneasy. The Man in Black stands, approaches the Ghost, and says to him, Just give me your hand and youll be free. The Ghost looks concerned. The Man in Black says, You only have to do one thing and she can be all yours. The Man in Black looks over his shoulder at The Man. The Ghost understands the implication and looks stunned. The Man in Black tells him to think about it.The next morning, The Man is outside on the bench. The Ghost is in the living room looking at him through the window. The Man in Black says to the Ghost, Youll be no different than you are now. The Man in Black is watching the Ghost. He approaches the Ghost and joins him at the window looking at The Man. The Man in Black says, He may even take your place. The Man stands from the bench and walks away from the cabin. The Man in Black tells the Ghost, You cant get something for nothing. The Man in Black backs away from the Ghost heading towards the door. The Ghost closes his eyes looking dismayed. The Man in Black says to the Ghost, You of all people should know that. The front door opens slowly. The Ghost looks at The Man in Black standing by the door. The Man in Black holds out his hand. The Ghost approaches him slowly. He pauses in front of The Man in Black. He looks from his hand to his face and then takes his hand. The Man in Black leads the Ghost outside. The Ghost steps outside alone and closes his eyes looking content. The Man in Black steps out of the house and says, Easy. The Ghost sees The Man walking back to the cabin. The Man in Black puts his hand on the Ghosts shoulder and whispers in his ear. The Ghost looks troubled. The Man in Black says, Trust me.In the kitchen, The Woman is cutting vegetables. She takes a drink from the bottle of alcohol she found in the kitchen when she arrived. The Man walks into the kitchen and greets her. She doesnt respond or look at him. The Man asks if shes not talking to him. She still doesnt respond or look at him. The Man says to her, First you say youll marry and now you act like you dont want anything to do with me. She finally responds asking, What do you want me to say. He says he wants her to say that shes happy to be engaged and that she didnt waste 3 years of his life while she was trying to decide if she was capable of being with somebody. She responds asking how she could happy with him pushing her and needling her. She says shes never going to be good enough for him the way she is, which is broken. She tells him that he wants to sweep everything under the rug like nothing ever happened to her just like her family did when she was a kid. She says he wants her to be perfect but that shes not perfect and its not going to ever be perfect. The Man is angry and says that its always the guys fault, even though hes the one guy that always stays when she runs, even out in the middle of nowhere on this island. The Woman tells him that she didnt even want him to come. She says the cabin is her special place and that he wont even let her have that. She says that he invaded and took over and started following her around and then yells at him for looking at her the wrong way. She accuses him of trying to control her just like he did. The Man asks how she could ever compare him to her father. She says that her mother didnt even know and that she wouldnt see it. The Woman says she wont sign up for a life like that bringing children into a world thats a living hell. The Man tells her to stop and asks her who she is. Shes holding her hands up defensively, even though The Man is not being aggressive. He tells her to calm down. The Woman asks if he knows how many people showed up to her fathers funeral. She said it was 500 people, practically the whole town, and they were all singing the praises of this good man. The people had no idea what hed been doing to her for all those years. The Woman asks The Man how he can know her and how can she know him. The Man says that she knows him. She says that maybe she does finally know him and that maybe she can see though his calm exterior and finally see him for who he really is. She tells him that shes done and that it was a mistake for him to come to the cabin. He says okay and tells her that hell leave as soon as the storeowner comes back. The Woman tells him Mr. Browman wont be back for 3 days, so The Man says that hell take the boat. She says that hell get lost and then shell just have to come rescue him. He asks her what she wants him to do. She yells that she wants him to take charge and call Mr. Browman to come pick him up and get off her island. He says he will. She leaves the kitchen. The man goes upstairs to get her phone, but the battery doesnt have power. He yells that the phone is dead because she left it on, so hes taking the boat. The Man is very upset about the breakup and starts to cry. The Ghost and The Man in Black watch The Man crying. The Ghost looks upset, but The Man in Black is grinning. The Ghost sees The Man in Black smiling at The Mans misery.The Woman is at the cliff also crying. Shes remembering The Man giving her the ring there, thinking about him arriving to the island, and hearing him say that he isnt like the men in her family. Shes thinking about him kissing her and holding her and telling her that hes a good man. The Woman begins to sob. When she turns to leave, she kicks the ring box that she had dropped the day The Man had proposed. She picks it up, opens the box, and pulls out the ring. She puts it on her finger.Back at the cabin, The Man is about to leave the cabin with his bags. He goes in the closet to get his coat. He hears a noise and stops. He drops his bags and steps out of the closet. The noise continues. He leaves the room to investigate the sound and the closet door closes. The Man goes out the back of the house and sees that the window to the crawl space is open. He calls to The Woman and asks if shes alright. Theres no response, so he crawls under the house calling for her. Theres a loud thud and then silence.The Woman is hurrying back to the cabin hoping to catch The Man before he leaves. Shes calling for him and apologizing saying she doesnt know what came over her. She walks into the bedroom to find that The Mans clothes are gone. She thinks hes already left. She starts to cry and sits down on the bed. In the living room, the Ghost is looking out the window and The Man in Black is telling him that it gets easier. The Man in Black says that it becomes fun. He tells the Ghost that there are rewards and that With each one, you grow in the masters eyes. The Ghost looks unsettled. The Man in Black says that the master is good to those who serve him. The Man in Black reminds the Ghost that freedom comes with a price. The Ghost starts to speak but the Man in Black interrupts him and tells him not yet. He tells him that with each task, hell get more and more. The Man in Black whispers to the Ghost, He wants you to prove yourself. The Man in Black tells the Ghost that theyre going to have a little fun.Upstairs in the bedroom, The Woman is lying on the bed crying. The Man in Black concentrates and fills the house with whispers. The Woman hears the voice of her father as though from a memory. Her father is telling her that if she tells her mother hell slap them both. Her fathers voice says shes a good girl and tells her to come here and that he wants to tell her a story. The voice tells her to open the book. The Woman leaves the bedroom and goes into the hallway. The voice of The Man in Black is asking her if she remembers what her father did to her. The Ghost is watching The Man in Black, who is enjoying what hes doing. Suddenly the Man in Black breaks his concentration when theres a quiet rumble outside the cabin. The Ghost also notices the rumble. Upstairs, The Woman grabs the stair rail as the house slightly rattles. The Man in Black looks around uneasily and the Ghost looks frightened. Then The Man in Black and the Ghost hear a noise from beneath them. The Man in Black angrily asks the Ghost what he did. The Ghost looks uncomfortable and The Man in Black yells that The Man had better be dead. The Man in Black disappears.The Woman enters the living room and looks around slowly. The Ghost watches her. Suddenly the closet door flings open startling The Woman. She sees The Mans bags and coat in the closet. The Ghost closes his eyes and concentrates. The Woman seems to sense that the Ghost is there. She walks out of the closet and looks around. The room is empty. The closet door closes startling her again. She asks out loud if someone is there. Theres a bang. She asks, Who are you? Theres no response. She asks, Are you still here? Theres a bang. She asks, Why are you here? but there is no response. She asks, Do you live here? Theres a bang. She asks, Should I be afraid of you? She hears two bangs. She looks at her engagement ring and asks, Did my fiancé leave? She hears two bangs. She asks, Is he okay? She again hears two bangs. She gets frantic and asks, Where is he? Theres no response. She then asks, Do you know where he is? Theres a bang. She asks where. Theres no response. She asks if hes in the house. Theres no response. She asks if hes outside. Theres no response. She asks, Are you still here? Theres a bang. She hears a whisper that sounds like a roar. She quietly asks, Was that you? She hears two bangs. She asks, Who else is here? Theres no response. She asks, Is there someone else here? Theres a bang. She asks, Should I be afraid of them? Theres a loud bang and the doors fly open and the curtains move wildly and The Woman screams and falls to the ground covering her head. She runs from the house and sees the window open to the crawl space. She crawls in and sees The Man lying unconscious on the ground.Inside, The Man in Black has the Ghost by his neck against a wall. The Man in Black is angry at the Ghost for communicating with The Woman and tells him how bad things are about to get for him. The Man in Black takes the Ghosts face in his hands and threatens both the Ghost and The Woman. The Ghost is terrified. The Man in Black throws the Ghost across the house.Under the house, The Woman is caressing The Mans head asking him to say something. The Woman starts to cry and then starts to pray. The Man in Black interrupts her, revealing himself to her and saying that she was right about The Man. Shes startled and the window to the crawl space slams shut behind her. The Man in Black tells The Woman that The Man is going to do to her what her father had done and that he's going to do it to her children. She disagrees with The Man in Black, but he smiles at her and tells her, I'm a good man. You can trust me. The Man in Black said that this is what her father said to her mother the day he proposed to her and that they both know it wasnt true. The Woman asks The Man in Black how he could know that. He says that he was there and that he watched over her mother as hed watched over The Woman growing up. The Man in Black told her that he saw it all and that he knows why she used to come down into the crawl space. The Woman cries and says it wasnt her fault. The Man in Blacks voice whispers that it was the way she behaved in front of her father. The Man in Black says that now The Man wants to do it too, saying that it was the real reason The Man had come to the cabin. The Man in Black says that The Man is never going to leave her alone because men like him never do until they die. The Man in Black tells her that nobody will ever know what goes on at the cabin. He tells her that she can be free of The Man forever and that he can help her. The Man in Black says that she can trust him. The Woman picks up a large rock and raises it over her head crying. The Man in Black is encouraging her to kill her fiancé.Suddenly theres a crash and The Woman hears The Mans voice saying that he wants to spend his life with her and that hes a good man and she can trust him. She hears him telling her that she knows him. She drops the rock on the ground. The Man in Black asks her what shes doing and tells her that she has to stop it. The Woman says that she is going to stop it and that she knows The Man and that he does really love her and she loves him. Then she tells The Man in Black that she knows him and recognizes him. She tells him that he is the liar thats always been around and that shes not going to listen to him anymore. The Man in Black becomes enraged and The Woman tells him that shes not scared of him. The Man in Blacks face distorts into a demonic face, lunges at her, and disappears.The Woman focuses her attention on The Man, telling her unconscious fiancé that shes going to go outside to find something to help her get him out and shell be right back. She gets out of the crawl space and runs to the shed. But The Man in Black is inside. She runs around the shed and The Man in Black is blocking her path. She turns and runs back towards the cabin and The Man in Black is standing next to the opening to the crawl space. She spins around and The Man in Black is right in front of her. She looks him straight in the eye and tells him to do his worst. The Man in Black takes a step toward her when suddenly a twig snaps behind him. The Woman looks over his shoulder and her eyes widen, her jaw drops, and her breath shudders. The Man in Black stops and watches her terrified face for a moment. The Woman turns and runs. The Man in Black slowly turns around and sees what The Woman was staring at. The Man in Black screams in pain and agony for several moments as The Woman crouches next to the crawl space opening.The Ghost is in the living room looking out the window. He sees a darkly clad figure standing in the trees looking at the cabin. The Woman enters the living room and looks out the window. She also sees the figure. Its now closer to the cabin. Suddenly, the figure is gone. The Woman backs away from the window in fear. The Ghost turns and looks at her. He closes his eyes and concentrates for a moment and then yells. The Woman is startled and turns toward him. She can see him now. They look at each other for several moments. The Ghost then whispers, Forgive me.The front door then starts to rattle and shake. The door opens and the Woodsman (DeObia Oparei) enters the cabin. The Woman backs away fearfully and the Ghost steps forward to protect her. The Ghost holds his hand up and tells the Woodsman no. The Woodsman stops and looks at the Ghost. The Woodsman closes his eyes and, behind him, a brilliant white light fills the doorway. The Ghost is astonished and then also closes his eyes and they silently share the images of their thoughts. The Ghost sees that the Woodsman was on the cliff the day The Man proposed, and when The Man had started to fall from the cliff, the Woodsman gave The Woman the strength to pull The Man back up. The Woodsman sees that the Ghost had opened the closet door to show The Woman that The Man had not left. And The Woman sees that when she returned to the cliff that morning, the Woodsman had placed the ring box where she would find it. The Woodsman and the Ghost open their eyes and look at each other. The Woodsman offers the Ghost his hand. The Ghost is unsure and looks back at The Woman who is crying with happiness. She smiles at him. The Ghost looks back to the Woodsman and takes his hand. The Woodsman leads the Ghost out of the cabin into the brilliant white light outside the door. Before he walks out, the Ghost looks back at The Woman one last time, and the Ghost and the Woodsman are enveloped in the light. The Woman closes her eyes and the light fades. When she opens her eyes, Mr. Browman is in the doorway. She gasps and he apologizes for startling her. Mr. Browman says he was stopping by to check if she was okay. She asks why hes there. Mr. Browman tells her that hes had a funny feeling all day that something was wrong and that hed been trying to call her but couldnt get through. The Woman tells him that her fiancé is hurt badly and they need to get him some help. Mr. Browman asks where The Man is and she tells him hes under the house. Mr. Browman says, Lets go get him.The Woman is waiting in Mr. Browmans boat. The Man is lying down with his head in her lap. Shes running her hands through his hair. The Man says, It looks like you had to save me again, and The Woman laughs. She says, Not really. The Man asks what happened. The Woman shushes him and tells him he needs to rest and that shell tell him later. She tells him that she loves him and kisses him on the forehead. Mr. Browman arrives to the boat, unties from the dock, and sits at the boats wheel. He asks The Woman if shes ready and she nods. The three of them set off for town in the sunset. As the boat passes by, we see the young man in the black hooded sweater appear next to Mr. Browman. The figure leans over and whispers in Mr. Browmans ear.

title: The Parallax View
synopsis: Seattle, Washington. Senator Charles Carroll (William Bill Boyce), an independent senator, is holding a luncheon atop the Seattle Space Needle. Joe Frady (Warren Beatty), an alcoholic journalist, tries to gain entry to the luncheon, but is turned away. At the restaurant atop the Space Needle, Senator Carroll is holding a press conference when he is suddenly shot to death by an unseen assassin. Everyone looks around and sees a waiter holding a gun, and he is jumped by security guards. However, a second waiter (Bill McKinney), who also has a gun (and the real or second shooter) leaves unnoticed. The first waiter replies that he didn't do it, and he is chased over the roof of the building by guards, where he accidentally slips and falls off the roof to his death. The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years later. Joe Frady, writing for a Portland, Oregon newspaper, sets himself up to get arrested to get a story on a major drug bust. Frady is bailed out of jail by his boss and editor Bill Rintels (Hume Cronyn) who always complains that Frady is trying to create news rather than reporting it. Shortly thereafter, Frady is visited by Lee Carter (Paula Prentiss), a Seattle newscaster and his former girlfriend, who tells them that she fears for her life. Lee tells Frady that someone is trying to kill her and that six other reporters at the luncheon have all died mysteriously during the past two years. Frady shrugs her off by telling her that she's just being paranoid. But a few days later, Lee is found dead in her apartment. Frady investigates and the coroner tells him that she apparently killed herself with an overdose of sleeping pills, but Frady knows different.Frady tells Rintels that there is a story brewing here about the events behind the Senator Carroll assassination, and Rintels reluctantly agrees to let Frady pursue his story. Frady meets with a former FBI agent (Kenneth Mars) who informs him that they are many methods that can be used to make someone's death look like an accident or suicide such as certain drugs which are fatal, but show up that a person's heart failed on them.Frady travels to a small fishing village in upstate Washington where one of the witnesses to Carroll's assassination died. At the local bar, a rough deputy, named Red (Earl Hindman), tries to beat up Frady, but after a long and vicious fistfight, Frady wins, knocking out Deputy Red. The sheriff, L.D. Wicker (Kelly Thorsden), appears and applauds Frady for standing up to his loathsome deputy and he is rather friendly towards him. Frady asks the sheriff for information about the dead person, claiming to be an old friend.Sheriff L.D. takes Frady to the spot where the Carroll witness died: a small creek right in front of a large dam. The sheriff explains that the man, Alan Bridges, was fishing when a dam sluice had opened up, releasing tons of water to relieve pressure on the dam as it does every few days and that that Bridges was washed away and drowned. Just then, a siren announces that the dam sluice is opening again. Suddenly, the sheriff pulls a gun on Frady explaining that he cannot let him get too close to what happened to Mr. Bridges. Frady and the sheriff struggle and are swept away by the wall of water that hits both of them. Frady grabs a shore rock and makes it ashore while the sheriff is swept away and drowns.Taking Sheriff L.D.'s car, Frady goes to the sheriff's apartment to search it for evidence and finds test applications to the Parallax Corporation. Just then, Deputy Red arrives at the apartment looking for the sheriff and Frady runs. After a long and wild car case, Frady escapes from the deputy.Returning to Portland, Frady tells Rintels what happened and shows him the copies of the Parallax Corporation application tests, and that there's something big going on. But Rintels refuses to believe Frady is onto something. Frady takes the test application to a psychology lab where the attending psychoanalyst believes that the tests are for measuring one's mental state and ability to commit crimes. Frady allows a lab worker, and a former prison convict who served time for murder, to take the test. Using the alias of Richard Paley, Frady submits the finished test result to Parallax.A few days later, Frady meets with Austin Tucker (William Daniels), a former Carroll aide, who has arrived in the country and claims that people are trying to kill him for Senator Carroll had many enemies from his past for his liberal views and work. Tucker and his aide/bodyguard take Frady out on a sailboat where he confides in Frady that there is indeed a wide conspiracy in the Carroll assassination and that Thomas Richard Lindern did not act alone and that a powerful corporation may have covered it up. Tucker shows photos that were taken of the luncheon on that day, and points to the second waiter in one of the photographs and asks Frady if he knows the man. Frady doesn't and asks why. Tucker tells Frady that it's probably nothing, but Tucker also explains that he cannot shake the feeling that the second waiter looks familiar. A few minutes later, the boat explodes from a bomb hidden in the cabin. Frady sitting on the bow of the boat jumps overboard, while Tucker and his aide, catching the full blast, are killed.Frady meets with Rintels and tells him about what happened and Rintels agrees to help Frady with his story. Using his alias, Frady checks himself into a fleabag motel in downtown Los Angeles, and a few days later a certain 'Jack Younger' (Walter McGinn), claiming to be a representative of the Parallax Corporation, contacts Frady in his room and says that his aggressiveness (as shown on the test answers) makes him valuable for certain corporations. Younger asks Frady/Richard Paley to join the corporation for the 'special projects' division.Frady goes to the Parallax offices in downtown L.A. and meets with Mr. Younger who shows him a special room where Frady is 'tested' with a series of brainwashing techniques with him being shown various photos and images of death and destruction as if to make him suitable for indoctrination. Frady becomes aware that this branch of the Parallax is a training ground for assassins.As Frady is leaving the building for the day when his 'tests' are finished, he spots the second waiter from the Tucker photo talking to some businessmen. Frady follows the second waiter/assassin outside to his car and tails him driving around the city. The assassin switches cars with another person, and obtains a briefcase which he takes to the local airport.The assassin checks himself on a plane to Chicago, and Frady checks himself on the same plane. The plane takes off, but the assassin does not board for he has apparently checked in his briefcase which has a bomb in it. On the plane, Frady sees that that assassin is nowhere to be found, and after seeing that a prominent senator on board, realizes that the plane must have a bomb on board. After trying to sneak a message on a restroom mirror, Frady anonymously passes a note on a napkin to a stewardess that a bomb is on board. The stewardess relays the news to the pilot who immediately returns the plane to Los Angeles. After everyone has disembarked, the plane explodes.Frady returns to his seedy motel room to find Mr. Younger waiting for him and he informs Frady that Parallax have already had an offer of employment for Frady, but he immediately expresses suspicion as a background check made by Parallax on Frady showed that some of his references were false. Frady then makes up a new alias for Younger explaining that he's an alcoholic and lied on his background to land a job. Younger offers to look into it and again promises Frady that Parallax is a great opportunity for people like him, and then leaves.Realizing that it will only be a matter of time before they discover his real identity, Frady secretly mails the Parallax test papers and an audiotape he made on a mini-tape recorder of his conversation with Younger to Rintels. Along with it is a note from Frady who explains that he may be in way over his head and that if anything were to happen to him, that Rintels should publish this information about Parallax and what they do on the sidelines of recruiting assassins to kill prominent officials who threaten or get too close to the corporation's nefarious plans. Rintels listens to the tape and finally realizes that Frady is onto something big. Rintels, who practically lives in his office and orders take-out food every day from a deli across the street, orders more food as he reviews more of the papers Frady has mailed to him. Just then, the deli delivery guy arrives with Rintels' latest food order. The delivery guy is the Parallax assassin in disguise. The next morning, Rintels is found dead by his employees in his office, dead from an apparent heart attack after he was poisoned. The evidence is gone and the audio tape has been erased.In Los Angeles, Frady, unaware of Rintels' murder and that he is now on his own, gets his first assignment to meet with his new co-worker at a local hotel for their assignments. Frady sneaks out of the planned meeting place and goes to Parallax's offices asking to meet with Mr. Younger, but is told that Younger is out. Frady spots the Parallax assassin and follows him into the hallways of the L.A. Convention Center. Mr. Younger is there with more Parallax businessmen/assassins where they are talking about their latest plans. Frady watches them from a distance as Mr. Younger leaves and the Parallax assassin and a few others go to the platforms above the floor of the convention hall.Frady sees that down below Senator Hammond (Jim Davis), a prominent California senator, is rehearsing a speech he will give that night. Frady believes that the assassin is going to shoot the senator with a rifle that he loads and lies down on the walkway above the convention hall. Then, just as Senator Hammond is planning to leave before he makes his appearance, the assassin suddenly leaves, leaving Frady in hiding on the walkway, alone and locked in the area. Suddenly, shots ring out as one of the assassins shoots and kills Hammond with a second rifle from a concealed location, just as Hammond is riding in a golf cart out of the convention hall. Everyone looks up and around for the shooter, and sees Frady.... standing on the plank way above them near the unused rifle. THEY THINK HE DID IT!!!! Frady realizes (way too late) that he's been set up! Frady hides under the plank way as three Parallax security guards/assassins show up looking for him. When police sirens are heard, the three assassins flee, leaving the door to the exit wide open. After a few minutes, Frady tries to run for the exit, when the assassin appears as a menacing silhouette in the doorway (anticipating that Frady would do just that) and guns him down, and thus announces that they got the shooter.Several months later, a second congressional commission is held where the commissioner members (pompous and easily fooled) report that Frady had blamed Senator Hammond for the Carroll assassination and had sought revenge. Once again for apparently the countless time, the Parallax Corporation gets away with it when the commission rules that there is no conspiracy in the Hammond assassination and the Parallax name is not mentioned at all. Frady was the lone assassin. Case closed.

title: Attack of the 50 Foot Woman
synopsis: Title and credits run over a desert vista and a car driving on a dirt road. We open in the broadcast studio of KRKR-TV and the newsman (an uncredited Dale Tate) reporting on the worldwide sightings of a UFO. Referring to a globe, he traces the cities reporting and concludes, The stranger from space should be over our California desert in a matter of minutes. A 1958 Chrysler Imperial races down US Route 66. A large spherical object comes into frame and sets down on the highway causing the car to first swerve, then stop. Behind the wheel is a very drunk and distraught Nancy Fowler Archer (Allison Hayes). She screams while trying to start her car. She gets out and is menaced by a huge hand while screaming, No! No! She is clutching a large diamond pendant around her neck. She escapes and runs down the road. In Tony's Bar and Grill, we meet Nancy's philandering husband, Harry (William Hudson) and his latest gold digging girlfriend, the aptly named, Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers). Harry and Honey are getting intimate. Harry tells Honey that returning to his wife after their separation was a mistake, but he needed the cash, and Nancy is loaded. She is worth about $50 million. A man hasn't got a chance, Harry concludes regarding community property. Unless the wife dies, Honey reminds him. Harry registers visible shock, so Honey backs off. Another thought comes to mind--recommit Nancy to the nut house. At that Nancy runs into the parking lot and is intercepted by Deputy Charlie (Frank Chase). The commotion stirs Sheriff Dubbitt (George Douglas). The sheriff clears the crowd and mindful of Nancy's money and influence handles the situation with kid gloves. He sends his deputy to find Harry. When Dubbitt suggests black coffee, Nancy reacts with rage and anger, Black Coffee? You think I'm drunk, don't you? She pleads, You've got to believe me. It was right in the middle of the highway, thirty feet tall. It lit up the sky. You don't believe me, do you?Charlie finds Harry and Honey in a booth necking. He reluctantly interrupts the couple. He accepts a monetary gratuity from Harry who adds, You couldn't find me tonight, Charlie. I took a cab home. The sheriff directs Charlie to, Go get the riot gun. We're taking a ride in the desert with Mrs. Archer. The three drive off in pursuit of Mrs. Archer's giant and satellite. All they find is Mrs. Archer's car. They make a cursory search to humor Mrs. Archer, but of course find nothing. Angry and frustrated, Nancy gets in her car and drives off. At the Archer estate, Nancy drives up and enters the house. She is greeted by her butler, Jess Stout (Ken Terrell). Nancy immediately heads for the bar to make herself a drink. Harry is laying on the couch and suggests to Jess to, Beat it out of here. Jess only responds to orders from his boss, Nancy. Nancy tells her unfaithful husband he can go too, but he reminds her of her embarrassing episode with the police. They fight over his philandering and her alcoholism, but ultimately Nancy loves her husband and wants their marriage to work. She tells him of her roadside encounter with the satellite. She pleads with Harry to believe her story. He puts her to bed, gives her a sedative, snags her diamond pendant, then heads back to Tony's to see Honey Parker.Back at Tony's, Deputy Charlie and Honey are dancing. Tony (Michael Ross) is serving drinks at the bar. Charlie excuses himself when Harry arrives. He is annoyed that Honey wasn't at the hotel. Honey is even more annoyed by that, Fleabag you call a hotel and I'm tired of waiting. Harry tells Honey his wife is cracking up and shows her the diamond, the Star of India, as an inducement to bide her time and stay the course.Dr. Isaac Cushing (Roy Gordon) makes a house call on his richest patient. She's not well, Harry, is the doctor's conclusion. Cushing adds, She's suffering from mental exhaustion, and her drinking doesn't help her any. The doctor leaves as Nancy walks down the stairs from her room. They resume their fight about his activities, thanks to updates from Jess, and her delusion about a giant and a satellite. Harry returns her diamond pendant then walks upstairs. While Nancy drowns her sorrows in the bottle, the KRKR-TV reporter rubs salt in the wound with a news item about Nancy. Her story is now fodder for the public along with a strong inference her alcoholic hallucinations are responsible for the fantastic tale. A well-aimed bottle thrown at the TV stops the report, but not the hurt and humiliation. Jess and Harry run into the room. Nancy orders Jess to get the car and Harry to accompany her into the desert to find it. Before they leave she orders Jess to get a revolver.Harry drives while Nancy looks for her satellite. They drive for hours and find nothing, Just sand and space. That evening Nancy spots a flash of light. She is convinced it is her satellite, but they still find nothing. Nancy breaks down and apologizes. As they drive off she spots it. She runs up to it. She presses her hands against it, explaining, It's real. It's real. I'm not crazy. I did see it. Harry pulls his wife away as a Giant (Michael Ross, again) reaches out to her. Harry fires the revolver point blank at the creature. As Nancy screams, Harry, help me! Harry for his part drives off leaving his wife to the giant. Harry arrives at the house, runs past Jess and begins packing his suitcase. Jess demands, What have you done with Mrs. Archer? Harry ignores him and continues to pack. They scuffle on the stairs and continue their fight in the living room. An empty liquor bottle across his head stops Jess. Harry grabs his suitcase and leaves the house. Jess comes to and calls the sheriff's office. Harry arrives at Honey's hotel room and tells her, Get dressed and packed, quick. Before they can leave her room they are stopped by Deputy Charlie and the night clerk. This time Charlie refuses the customary bribe and takes the pair to see the sheriff.Charlie, Harry and Honey wait at the sheriffs office. The sheriff and a posse were out looking for Mrs. Archer. A phone call informs the three that Mrs. Archer was found on the pool house at the Archer estate. The three drive back to the house. At the house, Cushing and the nurse (Eileen Stevens) finish attending to Nancy and come down the stairs. Dr. Cushing tells Dubbitt she should be moved to a hospital when she's strong enough. Cushing is most concerned about the scratches on her throat. Harry tries to sprint upstairs, but Dr. Cushing warns him that she may be contaminated by radiation. The sheriff asks Harry where he was with Mrs. Archer the night before. Harry lies and tells him he was with Honey all evening. Honey corroborates the lie. The sheriff warns Harry and Honey not to leave town. In the car heading back to town, Honey again suggests a bit of murder to solve their problem. She informs Harry, I heard the doctor tell her (the nurse) that an overdose would be fatal. Harry sarcastically replies, Money certainly brings out the best in you, doesn't it? Honey presses, Have you got the nerve? Harry has taken the bait. As the nurse sleeps, Harry fills the syringe and creeps upstairs to their bedroom. As he approaches his sleeping wife in the dark, the nurse catches him red handed when she turns on the light. The nurse screams and calls for the doctor as Harry recoils from the giant hand and arm. Doctor Cushing, something's happened to Mrs. Archer, the nurse screams again.The next day a delivery is made. Meat hooks, lengths of chain and medical supplies are delivered to the Archer residence. Dr. Cushing consults with Dr. Heinrich Von Loeb (Otto Waldis) but Von Loeb is stumped by the cause of the giantism and the blue-green color around the scratches at her throat. He suspects radiation.At the hotel, Honey amuses herself with her record player. She was expecting Nancy to be dead, and tells Harry so. Harry reports she's still in a coma. The sheriff and deputy search the pool house area. Dubbitt notices a giant footprint in the garden below. Charlie spots a couple more prints. Dubbitt sends Charlie back to the office for weapons. He and Jess follow the footprints in Archer's station wagon out into the desert. They spot the satellite and walk up to explore it. Dubbitt concludes the giant brought Mrs. Archer home and placed her on the pool house roof. Jess finds his gun confirming the Archer couple's presence. Dubbitt and Jess cautiously enter the open satellite and walk past walls made of pegboard and past discharging fire extinguishers. They find a series of glass spheres containing various colored gemstones. They find Mrs. Archer's Star of India diamond. They encounter the giant and retreat out of the space craft. Unable to move the car, they abandon it just before the giant, dressed in a leather Viking tunic, overturns it. The giant is impervious to bullets and grenades. The giant reenters his satellite and departs. Dubbitt and Jess walk back to town.At the Archer house, Cushing and Von Loeb discuss Nancy's case and their own lives. Nancy wakes from her coma and calls for her husband. Harry and Honey are dancing at Tony's Bar and Grill. Charlie informs Harry that there is an emergency at home. Harry is indifferent to the situation and sends Charlie on his way. Back at the house, the sedative is not working. Nancy is awake again and calling for Harry. They try to administer more morphine, but Nancy breaks free. She tears the roof off her room and escapes. The house begins to come apart and Cushing, the nurse, and Von Loeb barely escape. Nancy is single minded now, I know where my husband is. He's with that woman. I'll find him. Nancy strolls casually to town wearing a makeshift bra and skirt made from bed sheets.On his way to the Archer house, Charlie encounters Dubbit and Jess on the road. He stops and picks them up and continues to the Archer home. They pick up Cushing, Von Loeb and the nurse. The six drive back to town. Out in the desert, an old prospector (an uncredited Thomas E. Jackson) spots Mrs. Archer heading for town. Nancy stops and shakes an electrical transmission tower knocking out the power at Tony's place. She then casually strolls up to Tony's, scares a young couple in their car, then heads for the hotel. She tears the sign off the hotel screaming, Harry! Nancy breaks a window and pushes her giant hand into Honey's bedroom leaving it a shambles. She strolls back to Tony's and calls for her husband. Harry takes Charlie's gun and shoots his wife's giant hand as it comes through the door. Nancy tears the roof off the building. Spotting her quarry Honey Parker, Nancy throws the roof beams and rafters down on the table Honey is hiding under. Honey is dead, and Nancy now directs her wrath at Harry. She picks him up and carries him through the open roof. He complains, You're crushing me. I can't breathe. Dubbitt fires a few shots at Nancy Archer but they have no effect. He finally places a carefully aimed shot at a transformer which explodes, electrocuting Nancy and Harry Archer. Both dead on the ground, Nancy is still clutching Harry in her hand. The doctor ironically remarks, She finally got Harry all to herself. We close with a long-shot of the doctors and townsfolk surrounding the dead bodies of Nancy and Harry Archer.

title: Peaceful Warrior
synopsis: Dan Millman is a university student as well as a locally famous gymnast who dreams of winning a National Championship competition. He suffers from restlessness, and on one occasion Dan attempts to compensate for the restlessness by running along streets before sunrise. At a car-service station, he encounters an old man who seems to know more about Dan's problem than Dan himself knows, whom Dan later nicknames Socrates. Dan is unsettled by Socrates' knowledge; by the fact that Socrates had appeared in a nightmare as a faceless janitor, clad in mismatched shoes (by which he is identified in waking life), who sweeps up the pieces of Dan's shattered leg; and by the old man's extraordinary speed, agility, and coordination. As a result of his exposure to the last, Dan seeks to learn the secret behind it.
Socrates, prodded by the impatient and defiant Dan, gives the boy a series of tasks and lessons. The central concept of Soc's philosophy is this: that one must live entirely in the present moment. Other ideas include the related notion that at no time is nothing going on and the idea that an appropriate time exists for fighting and another for abstaining from violence. These lessons are conveyed through practical lessons, long contemplation, and one spectacular mystical experience. Dan gradually learns to appreciate every moment; to view the journey toward a goal as more meaningful and significant than the attainment; to pay attention to that which he is doing – thus increasing his gymnastic prowess; and (to a slightly lesser extent) control himself. Throughout the lesson, Dan learns virtually nothing about his mentor, other than the philosophy, Socrates' belief that service is the most noble action possible (hence his choice to work as a car serviceman), and the presence of another protégé.
This protégé, a woman of Dan's own age named Joy, has learned and integrated Socrates' philosophy into her life, to the extent that she seems as wise as Socrates himself. Dan attempts to ask her for information regarding Socrates, but receives little. Joy treats Dan indulgently, though she evidently respects him.
One day, Dan drives recklessly, and his motorcycle collides with a car that ran a red light, causing his right femur bone to shatter. He is rushed to a hospital, where a metal bar is placed in his leg to maintain its integrity. As a result, his gymnastic coach believes that Dan cannot compete in the National competition. Dan, hurt by this lack of faith, recovers from the injury and resumes his training under Socrates' tutelage. Eventually, he is restored to full health and strength, while his coordination improves and his mind is set entirely on the present moment. He competes in the U.S. Trials for the Olympics and achieves a victory.
Slightly before the competition, Dan diverts the bus he is riding to Socrates' station, only to find that Socrates has vanished without a trace. At the arena, he attempts to teach his teammate Tommy what he has learned, but fails due to Tommy's emotional insecurity and lack of comprehension. Dan then is called upon for his turn to perform on the still rings. While he does his routine, Dan performs flawlessly just like Pommel Horse tryouts. Moments before he completes his routine, Socrates is in his thoughts asking him three questions: Where are you, Dan? Here. What time is it? Now. What are You? This Moment. Dan then performs his triple consecutive flips, the Commentators frantically speaking, and the judges staring at him in amazement. He then dismounts, while the rings swing outwards, eventually touching each other. The screen goes black, leaving his last moment unknown.
The postscript states that Dan and his Berkeley Gymnastics Team won their first National title. It is implied at the end, in a postscript appearing on screen, that Dan of the film and Dan the author of the book on which the film is based are one and the same. It is also stated that the latter Dan lives with his wife Joy.

title: Platoon
synopsis: Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young American who has abandoned a privileged life at a university to enlist in the infantry, volunteering for combat duty in Vietnam. The year is September 1967. Upon arrival in Da Nang, South Vietnam, he sees dead soldiers in body bags being loaded into his plane, but more distressing to him is the shellshocked state of a departing soldier with the thousand-yard stare. Taylor and several other replacements have been assigned to Bravo Company, 25th Infantry division, somewhere near the Cambodian border. Worn down by the exhausting work and living conditions, his enthusiasm for the war wanes quickly and he develops an admiration for the more experienced soldiers, despite their reluctance to extend their friendship.One day, another new arrival, platoon commander Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) discusses the plans for a patrol later that night with the platoon sergeants: the compassionate Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), harsh but hard core Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), cowardly, sycophantic lifer Sergeant Red O'Neil (John C. McGinley), and drug addict Sergeant Warren (Tony Todd). Barnes and Elias argue over whether to send the new men out on a patrol that is likely to be ambushed. O'Neil insists that the new troops go out instead of several men under him who are nearly finished with their tours of duty. Barnes agrees, only on the condition that O'Neil goes out as well.That night, North Vietnamese soldiers set upon Taylor's sleeping unit. Gardner (Bob Orwig), a fellow new recruit, is killed, and another soldier, Tex (David Neidorf), is maimed. Despite having passed the watch duty to Junior (Reggie Johnson), a more experienced but consistently irresponsible soldier who fell asleep, Taylor is blamed for the casualties (O'Neil is also to blame, having thrown the grenade that maimed Tex). Immediately after the fighting, Taylor discovers a light wound to his neck, and he is sent to the field hospital for treatment.A few days later, Taylor returns to his unit from the hospital and, through a soldier named King (Keith David), gains acceptance from the heads, a tight-knit group led by Elias that socializes, dances, and takes drugs in a private bunker. Next door, Barnes leads the more traditional members of the unit whom drink beer and play cards and don't smoke marijuana. Taylor becomes a more seasoned soldier as the patrols continue and soon no longer stands out amongst the others.During one patrol on New Years Day, January 1, 1968, the platoon finds what appears to be an abandoned bunker. Elias explores a series of tunnels connected to the bunker. Two members of the platoon, Sandy (J. Adam Glover) and Sal (Richard Edson) are killed when they stumble upon a booby trap attached to a box of documents. Shortly after, a soldier named Manny Washington (Corkey Ford) goes missing. His mutilated body is found tied to a post close by. The platoon is infuriated by the senseless death of their comrade and are ordered to report to a nearby village of South Vietnamese citizens.The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. The other soldiers explore the village. In one house, Taylor discovers a mute and mentally disabled boy and his mother hiding in a hole beneath the floor. Taylor harasses and taunts the retarded boy by shooting his rifle at his feet, but stops himself short of killing the boy. However, Bunny (Kevin Dillon) takes over and beats the boy to death with his gun, even though Sgt. O'Neil orders them to leave the hut. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is when Sergeant Elias arrives at the scene and starts a fistfight with Barnes. Lieutenant Wolfe, passive during the shooting of the wife, eventually ends the fight, and relays orders from his own superior officer to burn the village. As the men leave, a group of four soldiers, including Bunny and Junior, drag a young Vietnamese girl into the bushes with the intention of raping her. Taylor comes upon them and stops the group from raping the girl. His comrades ridicule him for stopping them.Upon returning to base, Elias reports Barnes' actions to Captain Harris (Dale Dye), who cannot afford to remove Barnes due to a lack of personnel. However, Harris threatens to court martial Barnes if there is evidence that he murdered an unarmed civilian. O'Neil and Bunny, nervous about the possibility of an investigation, speak to Barnes and Bunny suggests fragging Elias. A narrating Taylor speaks of this as a civil war in the platoon. Half with Elias, half with Barnes. Taylor talks with Elias one night and Elias tells him that the United States is due for a loss in war because they'd been mostly successful in past wars. He also confesses that he's disillusioned with America's mission in Southeast Asia, that he used to believe it was winnable even a few years ago, but knows now that it's not.On their next patrol the platoon is ambushed and pinned down in a firefight by unseen enemy soldiers. Flash (Basile Achara) is killed and Sergeant Warren (Tony Todd) and Lerner (Johnny Depp) are badly injured in the resulting skirmish. Lieutenant Wolfe calls in wrong coordinates for artillery support, resulting in the deaths of Fu Sheng (Steve Barredo), Morehouse (Kevin Eshelman), and Tubbs (Andrew B. Clark) and the severe wounding of Ace (Terry McIlvain). Big Harold (Forest Whitaker) has his leg blown off by a trip-wired booby trap while trying to escape the artillery barrage. Elias, with Taylor, Rhah (Francesco Quinn), and Crawford (Chris Pedersen), go to intercept flanking enemy troops. Though Lt. Wolfe is commanding officer, Barnes takes command. He orders the rest of the platoon to retreat to be airlifted from the area, and goes back into the jungle to find Elias' group. After sending Taylor, Rhah, and Crawford (who has been shot in the lung) back, Barnes finds Elias. The two stare at each other for a few moments and then Barnes fires three rounds into Elias' chest and leaves him for dead. Barnes runs into Taylor and tells him that Elias is dead and that he'd seen his body nearby. Barnes orders Taylor back to the landing zone. After they take off, the men see a severely wounded Elias emerge from the jungle, running from a large group of NVA soldiers. He dies after being shot several more times by the NVA while the American helicopters futilely attempt to provide him cover overhead.At the base, Taylor tries to talk his dwindling group of six heads into killing Barnes in retaliation, claiming that when he'd met Barnes in the forest after shooting Elias, that the look on Barnes' face told him the truth. While King agrees, Doc Gomez (Paul Sanchez) believes they should wait for military justice to decide Barnes' fate. Rhah reminds Taylor how much he admired Barnes when he first arrived, and that Barnes isn't meant to die, noting that on several previous occasions Barnes has sustained wounds that ought to have proved mortal: the only thing that can kill Barnes, is Barnes. Barnes then appears, very drunk with a bottle of bourbon, having overheard Taylor calling for his murder. He enters the room, daring them to kill him. No one takes up the offer but as Barnes leaves, Taylor attacks him. Barnes quickly gets the upper hand, pins Taylor down and holds a knife to his face. Rhah urges him not to do it, telling Barnes he'll be court-martialed and imprisoned, and he leaves, slashing Taylor under the eye.A few days later, the platoon is sent back to the ambush area in order to build and maintain heavy defensive positions against a potential attack. Rhah is promoted to Sergeant, commanding the remains of Elias' squad. The platoon is so severely weakened, though, that there are numerous gaps in their defense. When this fact is pointed out to him, Lt. Wolfe only replies that he doesn't give a fuck any more. The troops try to prepare for the incoming battle, during which they know the majority of them will die. Just hours before nightfall, King is allowed to go home as his tour of duty has come to an end. O'Neil tries to use Elias' R&R days for himself in order to escape the impending battle (in which he believes he will die). When he asks Barnes for permission, Barnes refuses, saying, Everybody gotta die some time, Red. Junior tries to escape the battle by spraying mosquito repellent onto his feet and passing it off as trench foot, a ploy that Barnes recognizes right away. Bunny states that he feels no remorse for the murders he has committed, saying that he enjoys Vietnam, and goes on to proclaim himself to be Audie Murphy, a famous and highly decorated World War II hero.Francis (Corey Glover), one of the last few remaining heads, is assigned to the same foxhole as Taylor. That night a large attack occurs and the American defensive perimeter is broken and the camp overrun by hundreds of attacking North Vietnamese troops. Taylor and Francis take on and cut down several attacking enemy troops until they both pause when they hear signal whistles from the unseen NVA sergeants ordering their men to cease fire. Hearing a Vietnamese voice over a bullhorn and understanding that the NVA are ordering RPGs up to the line to blow up the foxhole they are in, Taylor grabs Francis and both of them crawl out of the foxhole seconds before it's hit by an RPG. Taylor and Francis then attack and kill several enemy soldiers that overrun their destroyed foxhole until Taylor loses it during the fight and charges off into the carnage, shooting one enemy soldier after another.Meanwhile, the NVA attack against the base continues relentlessly. The command bunker is destroyed by a NVA suicide bomber (Oliver Stone makes a cameo as the doomed battalion commander inside the bunker). During the massed North Vietnamese Army attack, many members of the platoon are killed, including Lt. Wolfe, Parker (Peter Hicks), Doc, Bunny, and Junior when their foxholes are overrun. O'Neil survives only by hiding himself under a dead body. The desperate company commander, Captain Harris, orders the Air Force pilots to expend all remaining inside his perimeter. During the chaos, Barnes and Taylor come face-to-face. As a crazed Barnes is about to beat Taylor with a shovel, the two are knocked unconscious by the last-ditch American napalm attack.A wounded Taylor regains consciousness the next morning with a serious wound to his lower abdomen. He soon finds Barnes, who is also wounded after being shot in both legs during the battle. Taylor takes an AK-47 rifle from a dead enemy soldier and aims it at Barnes, who lays helpless on the ground. Nonetheless, Barnes feels at first not threatened, and he dismissively orders Taylor to call a medic. When Taylor does not comply, but instead continues to aim his weapon, Barnes (deranged to the last) dares him to pull the trigger by saying: Do it! Taylor shoots Barnes three times in the chest, killing him. Taylor then drops his rifle, collapses, and awaits medical attention.Interestingly, although not in the script, Taylor is seen on the verge of pulling the pin of a grenade that he found, only to drop it as reinforcements come to Taylor. (Charlie Sheen thought that Taylor would be committing suicide after killing Barnes. Oliver Stone thought that the mistake was good so he decided to keep it in the film.)Francis emerges from his foxhole and stabs himself in the thigh with a bayonet in order to be evacuated as a casualty. O'Neil is found by other Americans, and Harris (much to O'Neil's distress) gives him command of the platoon. As he is loaded onto the helicopter, Taylor is reminded by Francis that because they have been wounded twice, they can go home. Back at the bombed-out command post, hundreds of NVA bodies are being dumped into mass graves. After bidding farewell to Rhah, Francis, Tony Hoyt (Ivan Kane) and Ebenhoch (Mark Ebenhoch) (his last surviving friends in the platoon; the other survivors are Rodriguez (Chris Castillejo), Huffmeister (Robert Galotti), and O'Neil), Taylor boards his helicopter. The helicopter flies away and Taylor weeps as he stares down at the destruction, while he (from a future perspective) narrates that he will forever be in Vietnam, with Barnes and Elias battling for what Rhah called possession of his soul, and that he believes he and other veterans must rebuild themselves, and find goodness and purpose in their lives.

title: Wish Upon a Star
synopsis: Wish Upon a Star is about two high-school-age sisters with extremely different personalities, who magically exchange bodies with each other for a while, and come to realize what an incredibly bad idea it is to be anyone other than oneself.Alexia (Katherine Heigl) is older and taller. She is socially popular, but she is also dishonest, vain, extravagant, lazy, an airhead, and a bad student. She hangs out with a clique of obnoxious, cruel, arrogant, and snobbish friends -- Kazumi (Jacque Gray), Talley (Kari White), and Sabrina (January Sorensen). Her breakfast table reading is Self Magazine. She has a boyfriend Kyle (Donnie Jeffcoat) who is actually a decent guy.Hayley (Danielle Harris), the younger one, is a geek and a good student, interested in science and math. She has for some time been working on a science fair project, a lantern that uses discarded fruit as its energy source. She and her friend Caitlin (Ivey Lloyd) are both very shy. She has no boyfriend, and secretly covets Alexia's boyfriend Kyle. Her breakfast table reading is Scientific American. But she and Caitlin are not blameless -- They like to read Alexia's diary, and try on her expensive and stylish clothes, after school when Alexia is out with Kyle.Their father Ben (Scott Wilkinson) and mother Nan (Mary Parker Williams) are both practicing clinical psychologists. In spite of the wisdom that this ought to have conferred, they are both comically and utterly clueless and oblivious about their daughters' behavior. They decide early on that taking a hands off attitude is the way to deal with the girls' sibling rivalry and Alexia's provocative clothing. If there are no rules, misbehavior will be impossible. Because of this detachment, they never figure out what is going on when the girls switch personalities. Their breakfast table reading is things like Psychology Today or Nature Conservancy.One night, while Hayley is out on the porch stargazing with a telescope for her astronomy homework, she glances down at Alexia and Kyle in the hot tub. A meteor (shooting star) crosses the sky. Hayley makes a wish to be Alexia.The next morning, they wake up in each other's bodies and each other's bedrooms. They stumble around a bit in their unfamiliar rooms, and go into their bathrooms. Alexia, now in Hayley's body, notices it first. She sees herself in the mirror and screams. Hayley, now in Alexia's body, comes in. They both scream at each other. When they are able to talk, Hayley-in-Alexia's-body says:
Man, oh, man, it worked!
What worked? You did this?
I made a wish when I saw a shooting star. I didn't think it would work.
She brings her hands up to feel her now-larger breasts. (It's completely decent; they are both wearing night clothes. But the Disney broadcast cut out a couple of seconds here.) Alexia-in-Hayley's-body slaps the hands away. She demands that Hayley switch back, which Hayley can't do (it's daytime) and wouldn't do in any case. Alexia leaves the room. Hayley, now in Alexia's body, looks at herself in the mirror. She is delighted. Alexia has no choice but to go to school as Hayley. Hayley has an astronomy test, which Alexia can't possibly take because she is such a bad student. They decide that Alexia-in-Hayley's-body will faint and be taken home, and make up the test the next day after they have presumably switched back.Hayley nearly trips and falls while coming downstairs; she isn't accustomed to her taller body. They drive to school as usual, except that Hayley doesn't know how to drive, so Alexia has to. When they arrive, the principal Ms. Mittermiller (Lois Chiles) sees what appears to be Hayley in the driver's seat, and chews them out for this. During the astronomy test, Alexia-in-Hayley's-body faints, as planned, and is taken home by her mother.At lunch, Hayley-in-Alexia's-body invites Caitlin (her actual friend) to join her and her clique for lunch. Caitlin is astonished at being let into this clique. The other people don't see anything wrong, except for the strange invitation to invite Caitlin. It then comes out that Alexia had split up with Kyle the previous night in the hot tub. These people have an arcane set of rules, one of which is that one is not allowed to go out with any one boy for more than three months, and the clock was up last night. She was supposed to call Kyle a sick puppy and send him on his way. Hayley-in-Alexia's-body is horrified. She runs over to where Kyle is. Kyle is hostile. She says Whatever I said last night I didn't mean. I wasn't being myself. She wants to go for a walk with him after school. He says I'm not interested in going with someone who calls me a sick puppy. She finally persuades him to get together after his basketball practice, and they can talk, and she can give him a ride home.Meanwhile, back home, Alexia is eating ice cream and watching music videos. Their new neighbor Simon (Matt Barker) comes over to give her some cookies. He has noticed Hayley and likes her. But this is actually Alexia, and she doesn't know who he is. He is puzzled by this.The time has come for Hayley-in-Alexia's-body to give Kyle a ride home. She has an extremely hard time driving; she never learned. After she goes up on the curb and nearly has some accidents, Kyle takes over the driving. They arrive at Kyle's house. She tells him that he is the most gorgeous guy she's ever met. He tells her that he really likes her, and thinks that she is beautiful, especially now that she isn't wearing so much makeup. She wants him to say that he loves her. He doesn't want to do that, but he says that he really really likes her, and wants them to be together. They do a lot of kissing, over Mozart's sensuous Elvira Madigan Concerto on the car radio (Hayley likes classical, Alexia likes rock.) This is a first for her; she has gotten her wish.When she gets home, Alexia-in-Hayley's-body is already eating dinner. Hayley sits down, and Alexia notices that she has a hickey on her neck from the kissing. She drags Hayley into the kitchen.
That's a hickey, you tramp! Who did this?
Kyle. We were kissing.
I broke up with Kyle last night.
Well, you got back together with him this afternoon.
Alexia drags Hayley into the backyard and yells at her.
You mean to tell me that I'm stuck in this measly little body for another day, while you just parade around, ruining my reputation?
Looks that way, doesn't it?
That's it. This is war!The next morning, the war begins. Alexia-in-Hayley's-body has hung a threatening note over Hayley's bed. When Hayley comes downstairs, she sees that Alexia is wearing an extremely provocative dominatrix outfit. Their parents make no attempt to stop this. Hayley goes back upstairs and dresses as a complete slob. She goes out to drive to school, without taking Alexia. Simon asks for a ride, and she gives it to him. Her driving skills are improving very slowly.Meanwhile, Alexia-in-Hayley's-body goes to school with a boombox and a tape of seductive music. At various times each of them writes an insulting graffito about the other on the restroom wall: Hayley/Alexia Wheaton is a wench. The photographs of the candidates for Queen of the upcoming Winter Festival are taken that day. Alexia is in the running, and she (that is, Hayley) deliberately bombs the picture.It's time for Hayley to make up the astronomy test. It's really Alexia, and she is willfully rude and uncooperative, to the disgust of the teacher, Mr. Frauenfleder (Dane Stevens).At lunch, Alexia-in-Hayley's-body gets up on a table, takes off her jacket to reveal the dominatrix outfit, puts on the boombox, and performs an incredibly raunchy and risque song and dance. (This was almost completely censored in the Disney version.) Caitlin is horrified to see her friend acting this way. To retaliate, Hayley-in-Alexia's-body grabs Kyle, brings him right in front of her sister, and starts violently kissing him, saying Oh Kyle, you're such a good kisser. Give me another hickey, baby. Ms. Mittermiller arrives and puts a stop to everything. She takes the girls into her office. They are totally unrepentant and disrespectful. She tells Hayley that this is grounds for disqualification from the science fair, threatens Alexia with suspension, and says that she will meet with their parents the next day. She then takes them both into the ladies room and tells them to clean up the graffiti. After Ms. Mittermiller leaves, Hayley-in-Alexia's-body says:
I can't believe you would do that. I've been working a year on that [science fair] project.
If I could have, I would have had you expelled too. I mean at first you come home with a hickey on your neck. Next you're practically mauling my boyfriend in the cafeteria. What next, Hayley? Are you going to lose my virginity too?
You--You're a virgin?
Yes, I'm a virgin!!! I have morals, Hayley! You obviously don't know very much about me.
Wow. I mean, Caitlin and I were sure that you and Kyle were---Well, I didn't do anything like that, except kiss. A lot.
You didn't?
I can't believe you actually thought I would do that.
What am I supposed to think?
I'm sorry, Alex. I'm really sorry.
They both see that what they have been doing is wrong. They reach an understanding that they will help and support each other, and will switch back as soon as possible.That night, they plan to see a shooting star and reverse the wish. Before doing that, while lying on a blanket in the backyard, they talk. Alexia-in-Hayley's-body assures Hayley that she, Hayley, is good-looking and can get a boyfriend; she just needs social confidence. She should approach Simon. They agree to put off the switch one more day, so that Hayley can gain more social confidence in Alexia's body, and Hayley can use her intellect to show Alexia's teachers that she is not an airhead.The next day, the threatened conference between the school principal and the girls' parents takes place. Ms. Mittermiller tells them in no uncertain terms how shocking the girls' behavior had been in the cafeteria. The parents explain their hands off theory of upbringing, that they are allowing the girls to do anything they want, and that they consider this a positive innovation in parenting. Ms. Mittermiller is left speechless. After the parents leave, she mutters to herself Those poor girls.In a math class that both sisters are taking, the teacher Mr. Watson (Mark Hofeling) asks for a volunteer to work out a practice problem for an upcoming test. Hayley-in-Alexia's-body volunteers. Mr. Watson is initially skeptical, because Alexia is such a bad student. He finally lets her come to the whiteboard and do the problem, which she (Hayley) does superbly.Hayley-in-Alexia's-body goes to hang out at Kyle's basketball team practice. Kyle is very happy; he will be starting on the team for the next day's game, and then Alexia will be crowned Queen of the Winter Festival, and they will dance the night away. He tells her that he loves her. Hayley is in an impossible position. She says You shouldn't have said that to me. I've got to go home. The next time you say it, you know, the 'L' word, if you decide you still feel that way, pretend like it's the first time. She runs off, leaving Kyle bewildered and heartbroken. She goes out to the parking lot, where Simon asks her for a ride home. He gives her a box of chocolates, and gives her a quick kiss on the cheek. They drive off. Kyle sees the whole thing from behind the door.While they are driving--Hayley's driving skill has significantly improved by now--Simon apologizes for the kiss, and tells Hayley-in-Alexia's-body that he really likes her. Not for her looks, but for her personality. He says that he had had a crush on Hayley at first, but that he and Alexia are personally compatible. Wait. You're talking about Hayley? You think Hayley's attractive? Simon tells her It's what's inside that really matters. She is absolutely delighted. Simon likes Hayley, body and soul, for who she really is. She says Look, Simon. I think you need to get to know Hayley better. We're sisters. We're a lot more alike than you think.That night, the weather is clear, and they plan to stay up and do some star-gazing. But they both fall asleep in the living room, and their parents find them and put them in their beds. But in the middle of the night Hayley-in-Alexia's-body wakes up, realizes what she has to do, goes out onto the balcony to watch. She sees a shooting star and makes a wish to be Hayley again.Unfortunately, the next morning, nothing has changed. Hayley realizes that the change is apparently irreversible. She is ruined. She will spend the rest of her life as someone other than who she is. She doesn't tell Alexia what happened. Adding to her grief, today is an important day for both of them. Her sister will be making the presentation, for the science fair committee, of the project that she had worked on. And the admissions committee of Felder College, that Alexia wants to get into, will be interviewing her, as Alexia. That evening will be the big basketball game and the Winter Festival. At lunch, Hayley gives Alexia some last-minute coaching on how to explain the workings of the distillation process in the lantern. Then they see some flyers that are being distributed, inviting the whole school to a party at Caitlin's house. They are sure that Caitlin would never have done that. It was perpetrated by Kazumi, Talley, and Sabrina. Caitlin had thought they were her new friends, and had simply invited the three of them over for dinner. Alexia and Hayley both go to confront them. Caitlin is in tears. Alexia-in-Hayley's-body takes Caitlin away, while Hayley chews the the three of them out, and demands that they apologize to Catlin. They refuse to do so. Hayley-in-Alexia's-body says that, if they exploit gentle people like Caitlin that way, they are not worthy of being her friends any more. She leaves. She then has one more difficult encounter with Kyle, reminding her of how totally she has messed up her life.Alexia gets through the science fair presentation successfully, and Hayley gets through the college interview successfully. The home team wins the basketball game.Before the Winter Festival itself, Alexia-in-Hayley's-body goes searching for Hayley, and finds her, brooding by herself, in the grandstand of the swimming pool. Alexia shows off the new dress she has bought. She of course got it for Hayley herself, for after they have switched back. Hayley asks:
Do you like it?
Of course.
Could you live your life like that?
Sure, but that's irrelevant. We're going to switch back.
Then Hayley tearfully explains that the change is irreversible. They can't switch back. She tells Alexia that she had gone out on the balcony the previous night, seen a shooting star, and made a wish. And nothing happened. Alexia then explains that, back when she was in the hot tub with Kyle, she had seen the same shooting star, and made a wish to be Hayley. Why would you wish that? There I was, this C-minus student, about to break up with my boyfriend over some self-imposed rule. I felt totally bored with myself, and my friends, and everything. I realized that I didn't have much of a shot at getting into college. And I look up on the balcony and I see my brainy, adventurous little sister, with all these interests, like conserving energy. And I knew you would never make the same mistakes I made. They come to the realization that the wish only works when both people make it. They run out to the athletic field for some star-gazing. The heavens oblige them, they make the wish, and they switch back.They go back inside, where the Winter Festival is going on. Alexia's three friends come by, and tell her that they have decided to abolish all the funny rules, except for number 9, the one that says they will be friends forever. She then finds Kyle, and says Just give me one more chance, please? What about that other guy I saw you with? He is referring to seeing Simon kissing her, but she knows nothing about this; she wasn't there. She says There's only one guy for me. I love you. I love you too, Aly. Alexia almost misses the announcement that she has won the vote to Festival Queen, because she and Kyle are kissing.Then Hayley finds Simon, and says Look, Simon. I know you haven't gotten the best impression of me so far. So let's start over. Simon replies Alex did say I should get to know you better. The two sisters are finally in the right bodies dancing with the right boyfriends.

title: Toy Story
synopsis: A boy called Andy Davis (voice: John Morris) uses his toys to act out a bank robbery. The bank is a cardboard box, the robber is Mr. Potato Head (voice: Don Rickles) assisted by Slinky Dog (voice: Jim Varney), and the bystanders include Bo Peep (voice: Annie Potts) and her sheep. The day is saved by cowboy doll Woody (voice: Tom Hanks) playing the sheriff, with help from Rex the dinosaur (voice: Wallace Shawn). Woody is the only toy who gets to say his own lines because he has a pull-string that makes him say things like Reach for the sky! and You're my favorite deputy!During the opening credits (soundtrack: Randy Newman's You've Got a Friend in Me), Andy takes Woody downstairs to find his mother (voice: Laurie Metcalf) decorating the dining room for his birthday party. He asks if they can leave the decorations up until they move, and his mom agrees. She says the guests will arrive soon and sends him back upstairs to get his baby sister Molly (voice: Hannah Unkrich), whose crib is in his room. Andy tosses Woody onto his bed before he pulls Molly out of her crib and carries her away.Woody and the other toys have seemed limp and inanimate up to this point, but as soon as Andy leaves the room, Woody sits up and expresses surprise that the birthday party is today. He calls Ok, everybody, the coast is clear, and the other toys come to life too. Woody calls a staff meeting and tells Slinky Dog to spread the word. Within a few minutes (during which Bo Peep makes a date with Woody for that evening), all the toys are assembled. Woody starts by reminding them all to find a moving buddy so they don't get lost when the Davis family moves to their new house, which will happen in a week. Then he tries to downplay the news that Andy's birthday party is happening today, but it causes a commotion as the toys know that Andy's actual birthday isn't till next week. Rex worries that someone will give Andy another dinosaur, and many of the toys have similar concerns. Woody points out that it makes sense to have the party before the move, then tries to calm them down. He's interrupted when Hamm (voice: John Ratzenberger) the piggybank, stationed near the window, announces that the guests are arriving. The toys rush to the window to see the presents the kids are bringing; the bigger boxes make them especially nervous. Hamm predicts we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure. Woody finally says, If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?Sending out the troops means that the little green plastic soldiers, led by Sarge (voice: R. Lee Ermey), lower the baby monitor to the first floor and hide with it in a potted plant, where they can observe the opening of the gifts and report back to the toys in Andy's room. At first, the presents seem nonthreatening — a lunchbox, bed sheets (who invited that kid? wonders Mr. Potato Head), a Battleship game. But Andy's mom pulls a surprise present from the closet. Andy's very excited about it, but before they hear what it is, Rex knocks the speaker off the table and the batteries fall out. Sarge warns that the kids are headed upstairs, but the toys barely have time to resume their previous positions before the stampede thunders in. One of the kids (Andy?) sweeps Woody off the bed, saying make a space, this is where the spaceship lands! They put something down where Woody was, then Andy's mom calls them back down to play games and suddenly the room is empty again. The toys creep out of their hiding places to see the new toy, pausing in surprise when Woody crawls out from under the bed. The new toy has taken Woody's place on the bed, which causes consternation. Woody reminds them that no one is being replaced, and they look up to see what's on the bed.It's Buzz Lightyear (voice: Tim Allen), space ranger, Universe Protection unit. Buzz believes he's crash landed on a strange planet on the way to sector 12, and his ship (his box) is damaged. Woody welcomes Buzz to Andy's room and tries to explain that Buzz has landed in Woody's usual spot. The other toys climb up on the bed to meet Buzz and ask him about the buttons and gadgets on his space suit. They're impressed with Buzz's voice recordings — a quality sound system — not like Woody's pull-string-activated voice, which sounds like a car ran over it. Buzz also has a laser (a little light bulb that blinks, grumbles Woody), and wings. Buzz takes exception to being called a toy, and when Woody says he can't really fly, Buzz climbs the bedpost, shouts to infinity and beyond!, and dives. He bounces off a rubber ball, does a loop-de-loop on the racetrack, and gets stuck for a few rotations on the toy plane tethered to the ceiling before flipping down and landing neatly back on the bed. All the toys are dazzled except Woody, who says that wasn't flying, that was falling with style!In the montage that follows (soundtrack: Randy Newman's Strange Things Are Happening to Me), Andy has Buzz shoot Woody, then puts on a cardboard replica of Buzz's helmet and wings. A western-themed poster in Andy's room is replaced by two Buzz Lightyear posters, and drawings of Woody on the bulletin board are covered with drawings of Buzz. The western-style bedspread disappears; the new one is emblazoned with Buzz's image and his name. In the final indignity, Andy takes Buzz to bed and leaves Woody in the covered wagon toy chest.Some alarming noises draw the toys to the open window, where they can see the neighbor kid, Sid (voice: Erik von Detten), who's about to blow up a Combat Carl action figure. Sid's dog Scud, a brown and white bull terrier, is tied up nearby and barking like crazy. Buzz thinks Sid, who's laughing maniacally, is a happy child; the others explain that he tortures toys. Buzz wants to help the doomed toy soldier, but Sid lights the fuse and Andy's toys duck as debris goes flying. When they look again, there's no sign of Carl. The sooner we move, the better, says Bo Peep.Andy's mom suggests dinner at Pizza Planet (a space-themed restaurant) and tells Andy he can bring one toy. Doubting that Andy will choose him unless Buzz is unavailable, Woody plans to trap Buzz in a gap behind Andy's desk. The plan backfires and Buzz falls out the window into the bushes below. The other toys accuse Woody of pushing Buzz out the window out of jealousy, but as they are about to punish him, Andy returns. Failing to find Buzz, he grabs Woody and the family drives off — but not before Buzz crawls out of his bush and climbs on the back of the minivan.While Andy's mother refuels the car at a Dinoco station, Woody wonders how he can convince the other toys that Buzz's fall was an accident. Suddenly Buzz appears. Woody is delighted, though more for his own sake than Buzz's (I'm saved!), but Buzz is very bitter over what Woody did to him. The two fight and roll out of the car, which drives off and leaves them stranded. Luckily, Woody sees another vehicle heading for Pizza Planet and knows that they can meet Andy there. He tricks Buzz into coming with him (but only because if he came home without Buzz, the other toys would attack him). Buzz insists on riding in the cockpit (the front seat) so he can wear a seatbelt; Woody climbs in the back and gets thrown about by the driver's erratic maneuvers. They reach Pizza Planet and hide in discarded food packaging so they can sneak through the front door. Woody quickly spots the Davises, but Buzz climbs into a claw-crane machine shaped like a spaceship, thinking it's the ship home Woody promised him. The machine is filled with three-eyed green aliens (voices: Debi Derryberry, Jeff Pidgeon) who believe the claw is a god. Woody climbs in to get Buzz out, but Woody and Buzz are captured by Sid, along with one of the little aliens.Sid takes them back to his house and immediately gives the three-eyed alien to Scud, who starts chewing on it. Then Sid takes a doll away from his little sister Hannah (voice: Sarah Freeman) and runs upstairs to operate on her. (No one's ever attempted a double-bypass brain transplant before!) Woody and Buzz, still in Sid's backpack, look on in horror as Sid replaces the doll's head with the head of a toy pterodactyl and gleefully gives it back to Hannah, who shrieks for her mother and runs away. Sid follows.Woody tries to get out of Sid's room, but the door's locked. He's frightened by Sid's nightmarish mutant toys, which Sid has butchered and reconstructed a la Frankenstein. There's an erector-set spider with a one-eyed baby head, a jack-in-the-box whose jack has been replaced by a green rubber hand, a fishing pole with legs, and other horrors. Buzz thinks they're cannibals. Meanwhile, Andy's toys are searching for Buzz from Andy's window. They have to stop when the car pulls into the driveway. Andy can't find Woody and many of the toys think he ran away, which they interpret as evidence of his guilt. But Bo Peep hopes he's ok.Next morning, Sid interrogates Woody about the location of a rebel base. When Woody remains silent, Sid uses a magnifying glass to concentrate the sunlight on a spot between Woody's eyebrows, which starts to smoke. Woody is saved when Sid is called away to eat his Pop-tarts. Buzz compliments Woody for not succumbing to Sid's torture. Woody notices that Sid has left the door open, but before he and Buzz get out, the mutant toys block the way. Buzz tries his laser on them and is puzzled when it doesn't work. Woody pushes the button that activates Buzz's karate-chop action and frog-marches him through the crowd of toys, which parts to let them through. Woody drops Buzz as soon as they reach the door and runs down the stairs saying there's no place like home, there's no place like home, a la Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.On the landing, he finds Scud, scary even in his sleep. He backs up, then Buzz grabs him and leads him down the hall past the head of the stairs. But the ring on Woody's pull-string catches on the wrought-iron stair railing, and he says (involuntarily) Yee-haw! Giddyap, partner — we got to get this wagon train a-movin! Of course the dog wakes up and comes to investigate. Buzz says Split up! and runs through an open door; Woody pulls another door closed behind him. Buzz sees someone asleep in a recliner and notices that the television is on. A voice is saying Come in, Buzz Lightyear! This is Star Command! At first Buzz thinks Star Command is really trying to reach him, and fiddles with the radio on his suit. But as the commercial enumerates his features and adds a disclaimer that Buzz is not a flying toy, Buzz begins to believe that he really is, as Woody keeps telling him, only a child's plaything. He's despondent. Then he spots an open window in the stairwell (apparently nobody in this neighborhood bothers with window screens) and tries to prove himself wrong by flying through it. He bounces off the stairs and lands in the hall, losing an arm in the process (soundtrack: Randy Newman's I Will Go Sailing No More).Hannah picks Buzz up and carries him off to her room, where Woody finds him playing the part of Mrs. Nesbitt at a tea party. (What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt. It goes quite well with your head.) Woody imitates Hannah's mother's voice to lure Hannah out of the room so he can rescue Buzz. Buzz is raving and depressed, but when he wails that he can't even fly out the window, it gives Woody an idea. He opens the window in Sid's room and calls over to Andy's room, where Hamm is beating Mr. Potato Head at Battleship. Most of the toys seem glad to see him. He tosses a string of Christmas lights across and tells them to tie it to something, but Mr. Potato Head says How 'bout we don't? and tries to convince the other toys that they should leave Woody where he is. Woody tells them Buzz is with him, but Buzz won't come to the window where the toys in Andy's room can see him, though he does throw Woody his detached arm. Woody uses the arm to make the toys think Buzz is standing next to him, but eventually slips up and they see that the arm isn't attached to Buzz. They react pretty much the way people would react to a severed human arm, with horror and disgust. They let go of the string of lights, which falls to the ground. When Woody begs them to listen, they leave the window, except for Slink, who closes the blinds. Woody cries.Down on the floor, Sid's mutant toys have surrounded Buzz. When Woody tries to drive them off, the baby-headed spider comes at him and takes away Buzz's arm. Woody can't break through the group around Buzz, but he's sure they're killing him until the crowd of toys breaks up and reveals Buzz with his arm re-attached. But they're cannibals, Woody says; we saw them eat those other toys ... then he looks at Sid's toys again, and notices that Hannah's doll and the pterodactyl have their own heads back. Realizing hes misjudged them, he's trying to apologize when they all disappear under the bed and Sid comes back.Sid has a rocket. His first thought is to use it on Woody, but Woody's hiding, so he picks up Buzz instead. I've always wanted to put a space man into orbit, he says malevolently. A rainstorm forces him to delay the rocket launch until morning.Next door, it's Andy's bedtime and he's mourning the loss of his two favorite toys. His mom comes in and says she's looked everywhere, and all she can find is his hat, which she gives him. (This is the white-laced red cowboy hat that looks like the had worn by Jessie, a character we meet in the next movie.) Andy's mom reassures him that they'll find Woody and Buzz before they move out — tomorrow.That night, Woody convinces Buzz that even if he's not a space ranger, life as Andy's toy is still worth living, though Woody himself despairs that he'll ever be Andy's favorite toy again. Buzz regains his spirit in time to see the moving truck pull up to Andy's house. But before they can escape, Sid wakes up and takes Buzz (still strapped to the rocket) out into the back yard. He starts working on something ominous with a big empty water jug while doing newscaster-style narration of the preparations for the approaching rocket launch.Woody pleads with the mutant toys to help him rescue Buzz and they hesitantly join him. (None of Sid's toys talk.) Woody outlines a plan and assigns tasks to each toy. Ducky and Legs go into the heating ducts to avoid Scud, who saw Woody trying to follow Sid and is still growling outside the bedroom door. Ducky and Legs get outside by removing the light fixture on the front porch, then ring the doorbell. When he hears the doorbell, Woody releases a wind-up frog from Sid's room; the frog scoots under Scud and zooms down the hall. Scud gives chase and follows the frog downstairs, where Hannah's answering the door. The frog goes out, Ducky grabs it, and they're both reeled up by Legs (who's part fishing pole) before Scud catches up. Hannah, exasperated, shuts the door, leaving Scud outside. The porch light fixture drops back into place before anyone notices it's gone.As soon as Hannah's out of the front hall, Woody and his cadre of toys come down the stairs, roll through the kitchen, and exit through the cat flap in the back door. They land in the bushes, where they have a good view of the launch site. Sid's newscaster voice is asking his mission control voice if launch pad construction is complete; mission control says it is. Sid himself is out of sight, apparently rummaging around in the shed looking for matches. Ducky, Legs, and the wind-up frog pop out of a down-spout as Sid prepares to start the count-down.The launch pad looks very strange. Buzz and his rocket are standing on a dart board on a milk crate. Nearby is an orange-striped traffic horse with a rake leaning on it and the empty water jug propped underneath. The jug is connected with vacuum-cleaner hose to a red funnel, which is aimed at Buzz's feet.Woody approaches Buzz, who's happy to see him and asks for help getting loose. Woody says Everything's under control, and falls to the ground in the manner of a toy expecting a human on the scene. Sure enough, Sid comes out of the shed using his mission control voice (all systems are go, requesting permission to launch) — and then notices Woody. He tosses Woody on the charcoal grill and says You and I can have a cookout later. He puts a match in Woody's holster and turns back to his rocket launch, where he lights another match and starts counting down from 10. While he's focused on this, toys are taking up positions all around the yard.Before Sid can light Buzz's fuse, Woody's voice recordings start playing, one after another: Reach for the sky! This town ain't big enough for the two of us! Somebody's poisoned the waterhole! Sid is distracted and comes over to pick Woody up off the grill. His string hasn't been pulled.It's busted! he says disgustedly.Who are you callin' busted, buster? says Woody. That's right, I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips. We don't like being blown up, Sid. Sid begins to look terrified. ... or smashed, or ripped apart, continues Woody.W-we? Sid stutters.That's right! replies Woody. Your toys! A rag doll climbs out of the sandbox and walks across the yard saying ma-ma ... ma-ma. A large toy pickup truck emerges from a pile of sand while a couple of partially dismembered soldier action figures rise out of a puddle. They all advance on Sid, who backs away and jumps when the three-eyed alien from Pizza Planet pops out from under Scud's red water bowl. Sid backs toward the clothes line and the baby-headed spider drops down on his head. He shrieks and shakes it off, but the toys have him surrounded now. Woody says, You must take good care of your toys, because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid. We toys can see everything! Woody's head spins all the way around (think The Exorcist). So play nice.Sid is panic-stricken. He screams, throws Woody in the air, and runs into the house, where he tells Hannah the toys are alive. When he sees the doll she's carrying, he says nice toy, and backs away. She waves the doll at him. He screams again and runs upstairs crying; she chases him.Outside, Woody and other toys are celebrating. We did it! As Buzz thanks Woody, they hear a honk from next door. Andy's mom tells the kids to say goodbye to their old house and the minivan starts to move. Woody and Buzz rush over and Woody climbs on the back of the car, but Buzz, still burdened with the rocket, can't get through the fence. He tells Woody he'll catch up, but Woody comes back for him. They manage to get on the back of the moving van, but Scud runs after them and gets hold of Woody's leg. Woody can't hold on to the truck and tells Buzz to take care of Andy for him. Buzz, sacrificing himself to save Woody, jumps on Scud's head, making him let go of Woody. Woody climbs back on the truck and pries open the cargo door as the truck comes to a stoplight. Woody pulls out RC, the remote controlled car, and sends him to get Buzz, who's under a parked car where Scud can't reach him.The toys in the van think Woody is murdering another toy and try to stop him. This is a problem because Woody's controlling RC. The angry toys pick up Woody and Rocky, the strong-man, spins him around, which causes RC to drive in circles around Scud (who's still barking furiously). They throw Woody against a box; RC's path straightens out. Hamm jumps on Woody. RC, with Buzz still precariously aboard, approaches a busy intersection. The traffic light is not in their favor. RC scoots under a moving car, but two other cars collide while trying to avoid Scud. The wrecked cars cut the dog off from his quarry and RC pulls away.On the truck, Woody tries to tell the toys that Buzz is out there and they have to save him, but Mr. Potato Head isn't buying it. Toss him overboard, he says, and they do — but Woody holds on to RC's controller. RC sweeps Woody off his feet and Woody turns RC up to turbo so they can catch up to the moving truck.Lenny (voice: Joe Ranft), the binoculars, notices RC and his passengers gaining on them and alerts the other toys. Bo Peep confirms that Buzz is there — Woody was telling the truth!What have we done? wail the toys. Bo Peep tells Rocky to lower the truck's cargo ramp. Slink stretches out and Woody is able to grab his paw just as RC's batteries begin to lose strength.In the Davises' car, they're listening to Hakuna Matata. Molly can see RC in the side mirror and laughs, but she can't talk, so no one else notices. RC is swerving dangerously. Slink, stretched past his limit, loses his grip and RC coughs to a stop in the middle of the road as the moving van disappears in the distance. Then Buzz remembers he still has a rocket strapped to his back, and Woody remembers he still has the match Sid put in his holster. He strikes it and is about to light Buzz's fuse when the wind of a passing car puts out the match. Despair. But when Woody's hand starts to smoke, he realizes that Buzz's helmet concentrates the sunlight just as Sid's magnifying glass did. They use it to light the fuse. The rocket catches them up to the truck and lifts them off the ground. As they go by Woody drops RC, who lands in the truck. Buzz and Woody go straight up with the rocket. Buzz opens his wings, which apparently break the tape holding him to the rocket, and zooms downward. He's still clutching Woody, who says Buzz, you're flying!This isn't flying, this is falling with style! retorts Buzz, repeating Woody's earlier line. They pass the truck again and fall through the minivan's sunroof, landing neatly in the box next to Andy, who finds them and gleefully tells his mom. She assumes they've been in the car the whole time.On Christmas Eve at the new house, Andy, Molly, and their mom are gathered around the Christmas tree. The army men are hiding in the tree with the baby monitor; the other toys are in Andy's room gathered around the speaker. Bo Peep pulls Woody under some mistletoe (held by her sheep) and kisses him. Andy's bed still sports a Buzz Lightyear bedspread, but one of the pillowcases and the comforter at the foot of the bed are western style. Drawings of Woody are again prominent on the bulletin board. There are two Buzz Lightyear posters, but also a cowboy poster. Balance and harmony reign.All the toys seem happy and relaxed; instead of fretting that Andy might get another dinosaur, Rex hopes for a leaf-eater so he can play the dominant predator.The first report comes in from Sarge: Molly's first present is a Mrs. Potato Head, to Mr. Potato Head's delight. He says he'd better shave and yanks off his mustache.Woody, a bit lipstick-stained and woozy, joins Buzz on Andy's bed. They're still friends. Sarge announces that Andy's opening his first present, but there's a burst of static and Buzz whacks the speaker a few times. Woody asks Buzz if he's worried and Buzz denies it, then says, Are you?Now Buzz, Woody teases, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?.Then they hear a bark downstairs, and Andy's joyous cry of wow, a puppy! Woody and Buzz exchange nervous smiles. The credits roll to the reprise of You've Got a Friend in Me, a duet featuring Randy Newman and Lyle Lovett.

title: Casablanca
synopsis: In the early years of World War II, December 1941, the Moroccan coastal city of Casablanca attracts people from all over the world, particularly Nazi-occupied Europe. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Café Américain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harbored enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: I stick my neck out for nobody.Ugarte (Peter Lorre) comes to Rick's with letters of transit he obtained by killing two German couriers. The papers allow the bearer to travel freely around German-controlled Europe, including to neutral Lisbon, Portugal; from Lisbon, it's relatively easy to get to the United States. They are almost priceless to any of the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to make his fortune by selling them to the highest bidder, who is due to arrive at the club later that night. However, before the exchange can take place, Ugarte is arrested by the police under the command of Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). A corrupt Vichy official, Renault accommodates the Nazis. Unknown to Renault and the Nazis, Ugarte had left the letters with Rick for safekeeping, because ...somehow, just because you despise me, you're the only one I trust.Then the reason for Rick's bitterness re-enters his life. Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) to purchase the letters. Laszlo is a renowned Czech Resistance leader who has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp. They must have the letters to escape to America to continue his work. At the time Ilsa first met and fell in love with Rick in Paris, she believed her husband had been killed. When she discovered that he was still alive, she left Rick abruptly without explanation and returned to Laszlo, leaving Rick feeling betrayed. After the club closes, Ilsa returns to try to explain, but Rick is drunk and bitterly refuses to listen.At different times Rick and Ilsa torment themselves by asking the club's piano player, Sam (Arthur Dooley Wilson), to play As Time Goes By, a song they loved when they were together in Paris. The famous line Play it again, Sam, which refers to this song, doesn't actually appear in the movie -- Ilsa says Play it, Sam, and later, Rick orders Play it! While Sam plays the song, Rick reminisces about his affair with Ilsa in Paris. Though she seems happy to be with Rick, her mood near the end of their time together is cautious because she has learned her husband may not be dead. When the Nazis begin to close in on Paris, she receives word that Victor is indeed alive in another part of Europe. She and Rick had been planning to take a train to Southern France to escape the German Army's assault; however, on the platform Rick receives a handwritten letter from her. She writes that she can't explain why she's leaving him but she loves him. Rick and Sam leave without her.The next night, Laszlo, suspecting that Rick has the letters, speaks with him privately about obtaining them. They're interrupted when a group of Nazi officers, led by Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), commandeer Sam's piano and begin to sing Die Wacht am Rhein (The Watch on the Rhine), a German patriotic song. Infuriated, Laszlo orders the house band to play La Marseillaise in honor of Occupied France. The band leader looks to Rick for guidance; he nods. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then long-suppressed patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. In retaliation, Strasser orders Renault to close the club.Later that night, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted cafe. He refuses to give her the documents, even when threatened with a gun. She is unable to shoot, confessing that she still loves him. Rick decides to help Laszlo, leading her to believe that she will stay behind when Laszlo leaves.Laszlo is jailed on a minor charge. Rick convinces Renault to release Laszlo, promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters of transit. However, Rick double crosses Renault, forcing him at gunpoint to assist in the escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa get on the plane to Lisbon with her husband, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed: Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.Major Strasser drives up, tipped off by Renault, but Rick shoots him when he tries to intervene. When his men arrive, Renault informs them that Strasser is dead and covers for Rick by sharply ordering them to round up the usual suspects. He then recommends that they both leave Casablanca. Renault, suggesting they join the Resistance, walks into the fog with Rick who says Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

title: Chinjeolhan geumjassi
synopsis: Geum-ja Lee (Yeong-ae Lee) has spent thirteen years in prison for the murder of a little boy and is about to be released. We see a group of carolers dressed in bright red Santa Claus suits, waiting for her release. One of them remarks that Geum-ja is rumored to be an angel. A man dressed in normal clothes, the Preacher ( Byeong-ok Kim) waits with them and seeing her come out, directs them to sing. Guem-ja approaches, stops and stares at the camera stone faced. Although it's snowing and very cold she is wearing only light clothing. The preacher asks about the winter clothes he sent her, and then uncovers a big block of tofu, presenting it to her. Grinning, he says  It's been hard, hasn't it? 13 and a half years. I'm so proud of you.We see news footage about Geum-ja, covering the murder of a little boy, Park Won-mo. One of his class mates describes the last time he saw the boy. We're told that Geum-ja, 19 years old at the time, confessed to the murder and we see her in police custody before a crowd. The news announcer explains that as shocking as the brutal murder was, everyone was more shocked at Geum-ja's good looks. A director wanted to make a movie about her, and the public took to wearing polka dot dresses, similar to what she wore when arrested.We see Geum-ja, newly in prison, meeting with the preacher who says Behind that wicked witch's face of yours, I saw the presence of an angel. We see her praying with the preacher. She tells another prisoner An angel, could that be true? Do you really think an angel resides in me? If so, where was that angel when I was committing such an evil act? I always wondered about this after hearing what the preacher said, and then I realized, that the angel inside me only reveals itself when I invoke it. We see Geum-ja helping other prisoners. She comforts an elderly woman, does another woman's make up, bakes a beautiful cake, and helps a woman study. She explains that the act of invoking an angel is called prayer and says Actually, prison is an ideal place to learn to pray, because we know that we are all sinners in here. We see that Geum-is speaking into a microphone and there's a banner behind her which says Testimonials of faith day for Inmates, 1997 She receives much applause from prisoners and officials alike. The preacher is extra enthusiastic, standing to clap for her.We then catch up with the preacher and Geum-ja in present day, resuming with a look at the tofu block. The preacher explains It's a tradition to eat tofu on release, so that you'll live white and never sin again. Geum-ja reaches for the tofu, but rather than take it she intentionally knocks it to the ground, stunning the carolers and leaving the preacher shaken, in tears. She looks at him coldly and says Why don't you go screw yourself? and leaves.Guem-ja visits a hair salon to see her friend and former fellow inmate, Kim Yang-hee (Yeong-ju Seo) Kim is overoyed to see her, crying and giving Geum-ja a hug. We flashback to prison, and see Yang-hee arriving, mentioning that she heard of someone in this prison whose face would shine. Yang-hee is tripped by another inmate, Ma-nyeo (Ko Su-hee) also known as the witch before they all go to bed. While everyone sleeps, we see Geum-ja from behind, sitting, facing a wall, as her face gives off a very bright light.Kim recounts her offense, strangling her pimp. Geum-ja teaches her to pray and lament past lives, and we see that Kim's face glows when she prays. In the present, Kim brings Geum-ja to her home. Kim tries to be affectionate and when Guem-ja is only cold, she remarks that she's changed, and asks if she's started the plan already. Geum-ja says No. The plan was already started 13 years ago. THey go to to bed, and Geum-ja prays until having a vision of a snowy wasteland, where she is dragging what appears to be a dog with a man's head across the snow. She looks him in the eye and says Farewell and shoots him in the forehead. We see that she has dark red eye shadow as she smiles afterwards. We see that the sleeping Geum-ja is also smiling.The next day we see Geum-ja walking down a city street and ending up at Won Mo's parents' kitchen table. Geum-ja has a knife in her hand and slams it down, cutting off one of her own fingers. We're told that she planned to beg their forgiveness until she had no fingers left. The parents are horrified and call an ambulance. Won-mo's father restrains her while they wait for it to arrive. All of the money she had, is needed to get her a finger operation. Days later, she finds work at a bakery, working for a Mr. Chang (Dal-su Oh). She unintentionally causes a scene when a young employee, Geun-shik (Shi-Hoo Kim) is so taken with her beauty that he drops everything he's carrying. He awkwardly asks if he can call her elder sister. She responds Just call me Geum-ja.We see her meeting with another ex fellow inmate, Woo Soo Yong (Bu-Seon Kim) who describes the early days of prison, saying She cried like a baby.Man, it was so depressing. We see a flashback of this happening, and her cell mates getting annoyed with her. A quick flashback shows her robbing a place in a mask with her boyfriend. She explains that she felt like she was going to die because she couldn't be with him. We then see her passing out in the prison yard, as she narrates that she had kidney failure, adding Then this bitch says she'll give me one of her kidneys. It's not as if a kidney's a bit of fluff, you give away so easily. We see Geum-ju in the medical ward in the bed next to her.Geum-ja looks at her and says Damn bitch. It brings me bad luck. Stop crying! before smiling. Geum-ja then meets Woo Soo's boyfriend and we see another flashback of the robbery, as he describes how fearless she was saying he's married to a goddess. Woo Soo blames him being at her side for her fearlessness. The two fawn all over each other while Guem-ja stares at them expressionless. Woo Soo tells her boyfriend that Geum-ja is readying a magnificent plan. and asks him to help her. Geum-ja produces a book which contains many folded pieces of paper, which they pin to the wall, producing what looks like plans to build a gun. He asks where she got it, and we see another flashback in prison.Guem-ja is sitting with an elderly woman, Ko Sun-sook, who tells her Go save yourself. Ko was a spy from North Korea who had Alzheimer's. She speaks to Geum-ja about dogs and chicken bones, while Guem-ja calmly looks after her. We're told that she volunteered to do this. She gives Geum-ja the book, saying for you have vengeance to take, comrade.We meet another inmate via flashback, Oh Soo-hee (Mi-ran Ra.) We see her getting taking advantage of by a Ma-nyeo, who forces Soo-hee to pleasure her. This happens again another day in the prison bath. Behind them, we see someone cleaning the floor with a mop and leaving. Once sexually satisfied, the tough woman walks away while Soo-hee cries. She slips on the wet floor however, and hits her head on the floor. Soo-hee looks back and sees this, as well as Geum-ja returning to the room looking over the woman's body. Geum-ja waves at Soo-hee, showing a bar of soap in her hand. Soo-hee in the present asks about the red eye shadow. Guem-ja answers People are always saying I look kind hearted. Soo-hee is a sculptor, and Guem-ja hands her a paper with a drawing, asking if she can make it in silver. Soo hee asks is she's killed the bastard yet. Guem-ja says Not yet. and says she's been busy. She agrees though that she's saving the best for last.We see Guem-ja at work at the bakery. A man seems fascinated with her and approaches her saying she's changed a lot and he barely recognized her. The man is the detective who was in charge of her case. When the detective's wife asks who Geum-ja was Geum-ja tells her story, even teasing the woman saying I kidnapped and killed a boy...Don't worry, I didn't eat him. The woman leaves the bakery, hysterical, dropping her goods, saying These were made by hands that have killed. We flashback and see the detective questioning her. Geum-ja is almost angry, insisting that she killed the boy. The detective doesn't seem convinced, asking her to describe a marble the boy had, which went missing, which she can't do. We then see the police escorting her through crime scenes, forcing her to reenact how she did it. At all the scenes, Mr. Baek (Min-sik Choi) is there, and makes slight finger gestures which appear to have some meaning to her.Guem-ja visits an adoption agency. The woman there tells her she can't give out any records. We flashback to see 18 year old Geum-ja, who the narrator describes as pretty enough to turn any boy's head, but wasn't the least bit particular. We see her calling her teacher, Mr. Baek, reminding him that he told her she was sexy. She tells him that she's pregnant and asks if she can live with him. He asks about her parents and the baby's father, but she says her parents don't want her there, and the father is just a big kid, not ready for fatherhood. We see her at Mr. Baek's place, getting surprised that he comes to see her, right out of the shower without clothes. Back in the present, Geum-ja climbs up the building where the adoption agency is, breaks a window and steals some files.She then goes to the bakery late that night, surprising Mr. Chang. She asks him for an advance. He says no, but she helps him decorate a cake which he seems to have trouble with, as his hands are shaky. He tells her that he was astonished at a strawberry mousse made by a prison inmate who, using poor ingredients, made a dessert fit for a king. (referring to her) She just says Three months advance. He doesn't agree but she acts as if he does, writing down her bank account number, and leaving the cake looking magnificent. She leaves with Guen-shik, who is asking her about killing, figuring she had done something wrong and paid for it and that was it. She tells him however, that she's planning to kill someone else.He's nervous around her, and talks about his future. She gets him back to his room and propositions him to have sex, taking him completely off guard. Afterwards, she tells him, Mr. Baek said there are good kidnappings and bad kidnappings. He said it was a good kidnapping if the child was returned safely. And since they're rich, a little ransom wouldn't make much difference. And, although they'd have to worry for a few days, the emotional reunion would make the family bond more closely. That's what he said, but then he went and killed Won-mo. The boy kept crying and Mr. Baek said he'd kill him if he didn't stop in five minutes. But then he really did kill him. If he were alive, he'd be your age now, but he's dead. Then the police found a witness. Someone saw me taking Won-mo to a bathhouse.Then one day when i came home from the market, my daughter was gone. I got a call from Mr. Baek. He said to confess and take all the blame or my girl would die too. The kidnapper had kidnapped a kidnapper's kid. Isn't that funny? She gives him her keys and tells him to keep her candles burning.She flies to Australia, where her daughter lives with adoptive parents. We see her reading them a letter in English, which says she came to see her daughter once and for all. They don't seem very pleased about it, but they have drinks and they lighten up. The stepmother (Anne Cordiner) tells Geum-ja she's jealous, that she had such a beautiful daughter, but adds She is now our life! Bothe her and Geum-ja laugh wildly about it, geu-ja laughing herself right out of her chair. The stepfather (Tony Barry) shows her a picture and says We love her very much. She's got such a beautiful soul. The stepparents quickly shift from laughing to crying the stepmother saying What would we do without our Jenny? That night Geum-ja shares the room with her daughter Jenny (Yea-Young Kwon) who asks if she can take her to Seoul. Geum-ja refuses, reminding her of her parents. Jenny won't accept that answer and the two argue loudly. In the morning we see the stepparents on the couch looking devastated. Jenny flies to Korea with Geum-ja.We see that her plans are coming together, The pistol is completed and has elaborate silver sculpting on the handle. Woo Soo Young asks What's the use of all this fanciness? Geum-ja insists It has to be pretty. Everything should be pretty. Woo Soo Young's boyfriend tells her she'll need to be up close as it has a very short range. That night, before bed Jenny asks Why'd you dump me? Geum-ja answers by telling her they'll go on a picnic. She asks again, however. This time she answers That's right, a picnic. Jenny wakes up in the night and sees Won-mo playing marbles. She goes back to bed when he doesn't speak English.Geum-ja takes Jenny out the next day and they pick up a puppy. Geun-shik drives them around and Jenny sits in the back seat painting her face to look like a cat. They go out into the woods and find an abandoned schoolhouse. Geun-shik tries to teach Jenny Korean, while Geum-ja takes the gun out for practice.She remembers Mr. Baek in a classroom. We see Mr. Baek eating dinner with a younger woman. He gets up while she's still eating and lifts up her dress from behind, initiating sex. While he's taking her, she informs him of dinner plans. He insists that she isn't the one to pay. We see the caption showing that her name is Park Yi-jeong (Seung-shin Lee) and she served time with Guem-ja. He sits back down at the table to finish his dinner. We see Yi-jeong 's flashback to prison. She's being bullied by Ma-nyeo who had intimidated Oh So-hee, only she's getting beaten up.Geum-ja is later feeding Ma-nyeo in the medical ward. We see that her hair is coming out in clumps. Ma-nyeo says I used to have a strong stomach. I don't know what the problem is. Geum-ja smiles and feeds her and says I enjoy helping you. Ma-nyeo remarks You really are kind hearted. Ma-nyeo is having serious and audible stomach issues. She reassures Geum-ja that she only likes plump girls. Geum-ja however, tells her, that she'd be happy to eat a lot and put on weight as long as she keeps taking her medicine. which Geum-ja then puts all over her food. Ma-nyeo leans over to get sick and Geum-ja adds And, hurry up and die. We see Yi-jeong asking Geum-ja later You fed her bleach? For how long? Geum-ja says Three years. After that Guem-ja inherited the nickname Witch which Ma-nyeo had, but was still called kind hearted Geum-ja. We see Park talking with Geum-ja, saying It has to be tonight, I can't take it anymore. The narrator explains that another ex inmate found where Mr. Baek was working and they arranged to have Park Yi-jeong visit him, leading to a romance.The preacher meets Mr. Baek in a classroom. He gives Mr. Baek a picture of Geum-ja at the bakery, meeting with Yi-jeong . He pays the preacher, who says the money will be used for the lord's work. Mr. Baek calls Yi-jeong, (while looking at pictures of her and Geum-ja) and she tells him to start dinner without her. He says he'll wait. We see that he has two other men at the table with him. Guem-ja calls, and Park tells her she has to make Mr. Baek eat before they do something. The two men who were with Mr. Baek, watch Geum-ja leave work with Jenny. The men attempt to abduct them and we see that Park has already been delivered to Mr. Baek, and she watches him eat while tied to a chair. They beat on Geum-ja for a while assuming she's unconscious. She surprises them by getting up and shooting the closest guy in the head, while the guy holding Jenny attempts to back away. She catches him getting right up to him before firing, the narrator saying Even in these stressful circumstances, she always remembered the range of the gun.We see that Mr. Baek has fallen unconscious with his face right into his plate. A badly beaten Yi-jeong laughs. Geum-ja and Jenny get there and Geum-ja pushes him to the floor with a spoon. She then starts cutting off his hair. Shortly, we see Yi-jeong and Geum-ja with Mr. Baek bound on the floor and Jenny asleep nearby. Geum-ja finds a letter Jenny had written, explaining how she felt about being dumped, that she wants to know the reasons, and telling her saying sorry once is not enough, but she should apologize at least three times. Geum-ja uses a 
Korean-English dictionary to read the letter. Yi-jeong drives to the abandoned classroom they'd found on their picnic, with Jenny and Mr. Baek in the back.Geum-ja stands behind Mr. Baek, who is tied to a chair, holding her gun to the back of his head, forcing him to translate her Korean into English for Jenny, who sits on her heels nearby. Geum-ja explains that she wanted to have her very much and loved her, but had to go to jail. She adds that she plans to return her to Australia when she's done with Mr. Baek, as her sins are too big and deep and I don't deserve a sweet child like you. You're innocent, but you had to grow up without a mother.But, that's also part of the punishment I must take. Listen carefully. Everyone makes mistakes. But, if you sin, you have to make atonement for it. Atonement, understand? Atonement. That's right. You have to make atonement. Big atonement for big sins, small atonement for small sins. Jenny asks if she's going to kill Mr. Baek, and wen she says yes, she asks why. Geum-ja says Because, he made a sinner out of me. Jenny asks what she's done and she answers This man kidnapped and killed a little boy, and, I helped him. Jenny offers to say sorry to his mother. which makes Geum-ja both laugh and cry. Jenny asks You were happy with me, right? and she says Too happy, for a sinner. Geum-ja then says I'm sorry. in English, three times and even adds another.She puts the gun up to Mr. Baek's head, but hears his phone ring and finds a key chain attached to it, with little toys hanging from it. She holds it in front of him and removes his gag. He asks What's with the eye shadow? prompting her to pull him backwards to the floor with his own tie. She starts kicking him. She gags him again, and then shoots him in each foot. She calls the detective, who is out with a team, who have found some children's bodies in the woods and are digging them up. She meets with him and shows him the key chain, including the missing marble. She tells him If you'd found the real killer back then, these children wouldn't have died. Right? You know how this feels. There were four. While Geum-ja is digging through Mr. Baek's place, Mr. Chang calls her and she tells him she can't come to work. He says there are two people looking for her who won't say who they are. We see that it's the Australian stepparents, who both smile, but can't speak anything but English. She finds video of the murdered children and shows the detective, who has to throw up. We see the Australians with Jenny, who is watching video of her cat playing.Geum-ja calls all of the parents of the murdered children to the classroom along with the detective and shows them the video with Mr. Baek in it clearly. Of course, there are extreme reactions, from screaming to throwing things, and some don't appear to register anything at all. She acknowledges each child writing their names and the dates on the chalkboard. Grief stricken, they break down uncontrollably. Once calm, she tells them He was a teacher at English schools in affluent neighborhoods. He'd pick his victim, kidnap and kill them, then move on to another school. He'd never pick a child from one of his own classes, which is why he was never under suspicion. Children annoyed him, so he would tape them right after kidnapping them and killed them straightaway. The voices you heard on the line while negotiating the ransom were taped off the videos after the kids were already dead. Now, you have two options. If you want lawful punishment we will hand him over to Chief Choi here. But, if you want a speedier, more personalized death for him, you can have it right here and now. One of the parents asks Does he have a child of his own? Geum-ja says he's supposed to be sterile. Another parent asked what he needed the money for. She explains that he just put it in the bank and it will be returned. A mother agrees With no kid, what did he need all that money for? Geum-ja says He was going to buy a yacht.They all discuss the options before them. One woman suggesting that turning him in would just lead to long trials. Another suggests that they let Geum-ja do it, since she's already been to jail. Another counters that that is too cowardly as they were their own children. One of them stresses that no one should be forced to cross a line they don't choose to. They start to take a vote, and the concern is raised that someone who votes against their own justice could tell the police. Geum-ja settles it by implying that if anyone informs she will come after them. Won Mo's mother suggests that they all do it together, reminding her husband that he couldn't touch Geum-ja's severed finger. They agree that they visit Mr. Baek in groups as they choose. We see then that Mr. Baek has been able to hear the whole conversation via speaker, from the room where he's tied and gagged.They pick numbers on slips of paper to decide who goes in first. They're all given plastic coats and various weapons are available. The detective gives them some tips on proper handling of a knife, to avoid them getting hurt. Won Mo's mother goes first with Geum-ja accompanying her. She asks him Why. He answers Ma'am there's no such thing as a perfect person. She leaves the room dazed with a bloody knife in her hand. Four of them go in together the next visit. One of the men says This isn't going to bring our son back. Is it honey? No one answers, as they all rush to attack him and Geum-ja watches.One of the women in the waiting room, one of the boy's sister, mentions to another's grandmother that the parents all look well off. She says that they could barely afford to keep her brother in his school, and lost their house and everything they had to come up with the ransom. The grandmother listens and answers My daughter in law killed herself and my son left the country. We all have our own stories to tell. Her father rushes up with an ax to take his turn. She reminds him that the grandmother still has a turn. He collapses on the way out the door, covered in blood and they help him to the other room. The grandmother gets her turn and doesn't bother with the plastic. She looks at him and walks out. We next see the detective pulling scissors with a name tag on them out of Mr. Baek's neck.They work together to drain the blood from the plastic sheet beneath Mr. Baek, and dispose of the evidence. The detective takes a group picture of them all and they bury everytihng including the body in the woods together. Geum-ja asks them to give her a moment before filling in the hole. SHe shoots him with her custom pistol, then drops it in with him and they resume filling.We see everyone together later, sharing a cake at the bakery. They sing happy birthday and blow out candles. The sister of one of the boys whispers to Geum-ja asking if she'll wire the money to their account, giving her the account number, prompting the others to give their own. Everything turns silent and one of the parents says In France, when there's a break in the conversation like this, they say an angel is passing, causing them all to look up.Guen-shik comes into the bakery and they realize it's snowing and rush out. Geum-ja gets a cigarette from her purse and sees Won Mo's marble roll across the floor. She then sees Won-mo in the corner as if he'd rolled it. He's smoking a cigarette although he's only a little boy. She starts to apologize, but he puts a gag in her mouth, as he ages to how old he would've been and stands up leaving her kneeling in front of him. He looks down at her and walks away.We see Jenny in bed with her stepparents, woken up by smoke, although they still sleep. Geum-ja leaves the bakery and Geun-shik sings after her, the lyrics in the song daring her to look back. He asks if she's really sending Jenny back, she doesn't look back or answer. We see Jenny walking also through the snow barefoot. The narrator says Geum-ja made a great mistake in her youth, and used other people to achieve
her own goals. But she still didn't find the redemption she so desired. We see her start running with Geun-shik following a little behind. We see that she's run into Jenny and kneels, giving her a hug. THe narrator picks up In spite of this, no. because of this, I liked Geum-ja. Geum-ja stands offering Jenny a cake. She says Be white. Live white. Like this. Jenny sticks her finger in the cake and licks it off. She then sticks her finger in it again, but offers it to Geum-ja. You too. she says, although she licks it off her finger herself when Geum-ja doesn't act. Jenny looks at the snow coming down and says More white. opening her mouth to catch a snowflake. Geun-shik does the same thing. Geum-ja looks up and smiles, shaking as if she just realized something. She then strikes her head into the cake. Jenny hugs her from behind and the narrator says Farewell Geum-ja and we watch the snow fall on the three of them.

title: (Blooper) Bunny!
synopsis: The cartoon opens with a short special, celebrating Bugs Bunny's 51½ Anniversary. Once that is finished, what happened earlier that day is shown, with a backstage look at the characters (featuring 3D rendering of the scenery). Bugs is shown rehearsing his one line in the special. Elmer Fudd is shown trying to use minoxidil to regrow his hair. Daffy Duck and Yosemite Sam are shown only begrudgingly going along with the act, complaining non-stop until called to their places by the director. They attempt a performance, which results in a series of animated bloopers.
=== Featured bloopers ===
Blooper 1:
Bugs Bunny begins to dance, but the music is slightly out of tune and the record skips. He then dryly looks at the camera and says, Ehh...What's up, Doc? in an annoyed and sarcastic voice. The director and producers laugh as Bugs walks off stage. He then peeks back in to say Monotonous, isn't it?, which gets the director and producers laughing again and right when the screen fades to black, the record scratches.
Blooper 2:
Bugs halts the performance midway, having noticed a loose floorboard on the stage. He then suggests moving the action back and readjusting the camera.
Blooper 3:
Bugs misses the cane when it flies out.
Blooper 4:
The cane is thrown before Bugs is ready to catch it.
Blooper 5:
While waiting for the cane to be thrown, it becomes clear that Daffy Duck has refused to throw it to Bugs. According to Daffy, his contract states that he is not supposed to throw canes to rabbits, resulting in the director agreeing to have someone else throw it in Daffy's place.
Blooper 6:
Daffy enters the stage at the exact time that Bugs does, saying that he thought it was a vast improvement as he walks away, only to bump his head on the boom mike.
Blooper 7:
Daffy does not appear when he is supposed to. Offstage, Daffy is heard telling Bugs, the director and the producers to wait, followed by the sound of a toilet flushing. As Daffy then rushes onto the stage dancing, the director yells, Cut! CUT! CUT!
Blooper 8:
Elmer Fudd fires a real gun as opposed to a prop, grazing Daffy's head. Bugs scolds him, but Elmer responds that he thought that it would be a gweat, big birthday surpwise if he finally shot Bugs after 51 ½ years of twying. Daffy starts yelling at Elmer for not using the prop gun and neglects Bugs's insistence on cutting. As he walks away telling Elmer to expect his lawyers to call him, he steps on the loose board Bugs had avoided earlier, and the board strikes him in the face and goes through his beak. When Bugs asks if they can cut now, Daffy grumbles, You smug son of a— and is then cut off.
Blooper 9:
Daffy dances onto the stage with the board still stuck to his face. When he pulls it off, he yanks his beak off as well in the process, but continues speaking and where his beak was, a mouth appears, though he fails to notice it.
Blooper 10:
Everything plays out correctly until Yosemite Sam emerges from the cake with a scowl on his face and two Cowgirls come up and spruce him up. The director instructs him to act cheerful for the next take. Yosemite Sam goes back into the cake, mumbling But I hates rabbits.
Blooper 11:
The spectacular performance is done perfectly, except for one thing, as Bugs puts it – there were supposed to be five rockets. A fifth rocket attached to Sam's belt sends him flying about before crashing into the camera. He then yells at Bugs, calling him a low down flop-eared son of a kangaroo, along with his usual cursing (which lasts throughout the credits) before being knocked out by an unseen glass object. Bugs then suggests that what had just happened can be fixed in the editing before one of the producers asks, Can we go to lunch now?

title: The Da Vinci Code
synopsis: A man revealed to be Jacques Saunière is being pursued by a mysterious hooded character known as Silas through the Grand Gallery in the Louvre in Paris. (Silas is later revealed to be a member of the ultra-conservative Catholic sect called Opus Dei that wishes to annihilate a secret society called the Priory of Sion, who is sworn to protect the Holy Grail. Proof that the Grail exists would ultimately reveal a devastating secret that would undermine the fundamental teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.) Silas demands the location of the Priory's clef de voûte or keystone. Under threat of death, Saunière finally confesses that the keystone is kept in the sacristy of Church of Saint-Sulpice, beneath the Rose. Silas thanks him, and then shoots him in the stomach.Meanwhile, American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), who is in Paris as an AUP guest lecturer on symbols and the sacred feminine, is contacted by the French police, and summoned to the Louvre to view the crime scene. He discovers that the dying Saunière had created an intricate display using his own body and blood. Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) asks him for his interpretation of the puzzling scene. Langdon determines that the pentacle drawn on the stomach and the way the body was posed was similar to Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of the Vitruvian Man. A cryptic message, written in blood, is found next to the body. It begins with the Fibonacci sequence of numbers, but not in the correct order.Silas calls a mysterious man known as The Teacher, revealing that he has killed all four protectors of the keystone and that all confirmed the same location. He dons a metal cilice on his thigh and proceeds to flagellate himself with a whip for the sins of murder. Facilitated by Bishop Manuel Aringarosa, Silas then travels to Saint-Sulpice and is admitted by an elderly nun; left alone, he excavates beneath the floor of the church to find a stone saying only JOB 38:11. He confronts the nun, who quotes the passage: Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further. Realizing that he has been deceived, Silas is enraged and kills the nun.Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a cryptologist with the French police, enters the Louvre as well and slips Langdon a message which leads him to the men's room. There, Sophie meets him and tells him that he is being tracked, a GPS tracking dot has been (unknown by him) slipped into his jacket and that he is a primary suspect in the murder case because of a line of text found by the corpse (P.S. find Robert Langdon). Sophie however, believes that Saunière, who is revealed to be her grandfather, wanted to pass a hidden message on to her, and that he had wanted to bring Langdon into the equation so that he could help her crack the code.Having bought some time by removing the tracking device, the pair begin exploring the Louvre based on their deciphering the message written in blood. It turns out that the part of the message that reads O Draconian devil Oh lame saint is actually an anagram, which, when the letters are re-arranged, spells Leonardo da Vinci and The Mona Lisa. Searching near that painting, they find another encrypted message, So dark the con of man, that turns out to be an anagram for [i/Madonna of the Rocks[/i], another da Vinci painting found at the Louvre. Near that second painting, the pair find a key with a Fleur-de-lis.Pursued by the French police and cut off from the United States Embassy, the pair escape to the Bois de Boulogne where Langdon closely inspects the key. He notices an inscription on the side - an address. The address directs them to the Depository Bank of Zurich where the key is used for a safety deposit box.In the bank, they find Saunière's deposit box and open it using the 10 digit Fibonacci numbers in order (1123581321). Inside the box, they find a rosewood container, which contains a cryptex: a cylindrical container with five alphabetical dials which must be arranged in the correct sequence to spell out a 5-letter code word, in order to open and access the parchment message inside. Using force to open the cryptex would break a vial of vinegar inside, which would dissolve the parchment and destroy the message.Unfortunately, the police are called by a security guard and they are forced to leave. The bank manager, Andre Vernet, assists them in escaping by taking them as passengers in an armoured van to escape the routine checks of the police. In the back of the truck Langdon and Neveu have a lengthy discussion about the cryptex and Neveu says that her grandfather often played games with her involving cryptexes. Langdon says that the cryptex might hold valuable information or another clue about what they are trying to discover. Eventually, they come to a sudden stop and Vernet forces them at gunpoint to give him the cryptex. Langdon tricks Vernet and disarms him and he and Sophie escape with the cryptex in their hands.Langdon suggests that they visit his friend, Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), for assistance to opening the cryptex. Leigh Teabing turns out to be an enthusiastic seeker of the Holy Grail, which he believes is not actually a cup (sangreal as in Holy Grail) but instead Mary Magdalene (sang real as in Royal Bloodline), who was driven away because Jesus's followers didn't want to follow a woman after their leader was killed. Mary was pregnant at the time, and Teabing tells Sophie that a secret society--the Priory of Sion along with its military arm, the Knights Templar--was formed to protect the descendants of Jesus. Jacques Saunière was believed to be a part of this society and Teabing suspects that he was training Sophie to join it also. Silas, meanwhile, breaks into Teabing's mansion and attempts to steal the cryptex. Teabing uses his cane to knock Silas out and they escape again, taking the butler, Remy Jean, and Silas with them.The group escapes in Teabing's plane, following the next clue to London. This clue was found underneath the rose carved on the wooden box containing the cryptex. The message, which had to be read using a mirror, refers to a knight a pope interred. Having barely slipped away from the London police (who were tipped by the French that fugitives were on board Teabing's private jet), Langdon and Sophie forego a visit to the library and, instead, use a fellow bus passenger's smartphone to do an internet search on keywords mentioned in the clue. The search results made them realize that the pope referred to Alexander Pope, who wrote the epitaph of Sir Isaac Newton (the knight). This leads them to Newton's tomb at Westminster Abbey.The small pyramid beneath the Inverse Glass Pyramid removed from underneath, revealing that there is no chamber as shown in the film's closing scene. It is revealed that Remy Jean is actually a follower of The Teacher as well, however he is killed by the mysterious man after freeing Silas. Silas is attacked by the police and, in the ensuing gunfire, accidentally shoots Bishop Manuel Aringarosa. In his grief, Silas dies in police-assisted suicide and Aringarosa is taken to the hospital, as well as being arrested by Fache for betraying him.As Langdon gets closer to solving the mystery, he is betrayed by Teabing, who is revealed to be The Teacher. Teabing explained that he wanted to find Mary Magdalene's remains to prove he was correct about the Holy Grail and threatens to shoot Sophie if Langdon does not crack the code. Langdon responds by throwing the cryptex into the air. Teabing catches it, but drops it, and it hits the ground. The vial of vinegar breaks and apparently spreads onto the document, destroying it.After Teabing is arrested, it is revealed that Langdon had cracked the code and removed the clue from the cryptex before throwing it. The code word had something to do with an orb located somewhere on the tomb, but Langdon later realized that, There was every orb conceivable on that tomb except one: The orb which fell from the heavens and inspired Newtons life's work. Work that incurred the wrath of the church until his dying day. A-P-P-L-E. Apple.The parchment inside the cryptex had the following message: The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Rosslyn waits / The blade and chalice watch o'er her gates / Adorned by masters loving art she lies / As she rests beneath the starry skies. Using the clue, they travel to Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland where Magdalene's remains had previously been hidden. In a secret, underground chamber, Langdon notices how the clue precisely describes this chamber, but the center of the room is empty, as if Magdalene's tomb has been removed.At the chapel, they meet other members of the secret organization that protected Mary Magdalene. It is revealed that Sophie is actually Magdalene's descendant and therefore is the current living descendant of Jesus Christ. They vow to keep her safe. As Sophie wonders if her secret should be revealed to the world despite the disappearance of Magdalene's remains (whereby DNA testing could have proven that Sophie is indeed a descendant), Langdon philosophizes that, if given a chance, would you rather destroy faith...or renew it? As Langdon and Sophie part ways, Sophie sets foot in a pond in an attempt to walk on water. Unsuccessful, she jokes, Maybe I'll do better with the wine.Back in Paris, Langdon accidentally cuts himself while shaving and the line of blood on the sink reminds him of the Rose Line. He follows the Rose Line and, realizing that the clue from the cryptex also fits this new location, he determines that the location of the Holy Grail is buried under the pyramid in the Louvre. Langdon then kneels above Mary Magdalene's tomb as the Templar Knights did before him.

synopsis: Text is too large - max size is 60,000 characters.




A white background. Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries, then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes, most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens, and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.The setting is New York City, sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce, a Wall Street financial institution, are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas), David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says This is a chick's restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia? McDermott replies Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant, including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there's no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account, which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything? says Patrick. I've seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah. Bateman rebukes him. Not a menorah. A dreidel, you spin a dreidel. McDermott replies Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes? No, just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks. Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU! Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks Speaking of reasonable, only $570. They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.At a nightclub, Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag, who lets them inside. As some 80's pop music plays from overhead, the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket, but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays, and then when she's out of earshot, he says You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, then play around with your blood. He takes his drink with a smile.The camera pans through Bateman's apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white, with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated, but looks expensive. I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street, on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. He describes his diet and exercise routine, and his meticulous daily grooming rituals, which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no 'real me'. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York, the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office, Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says Hey Hamilton. Nice tan. Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), to his office door. She's dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages? She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled, but she doesn't know what he cancelled or why. I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club. She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. What should I say? Just say no. He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch, as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. Something romantic? No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Just get me a mineral water. She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her, he tells her not to wear that outfit. Wear a dress or a skirt. You're prettier than that. The phone starts ringing, and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn't there. And high heels. She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown. Inside, Bateman is trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer album on his headphones, but his supposed fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) keeps distracting him with ideas for their wedding. He says he can't take the time off work to get married. Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. You hate that job anyway, I don't see why you don't just quit. Because... I want... to fit... IN. The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. I'm on the verge of tears as we arrive, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me, in an awesome wave. Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash, says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks, and then starts kissing her neck, slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi, he remarks I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. Bateman doesn't care because he's also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her best friend. She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs, tonight I believe it's Xanax. She's also engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus in the business. Courtney and Luis are seated beside him, and Courtney, slurring her words, asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. Yes. I read that, says Luis. Oh who gives a rat's ass, says Bryce. That affects us, says Vanden. What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Don't you know that the Sikhs are killing like, tons of Israelis over there? Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid, nuclear arms, terrorism, and world hunger. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern, and less materialism in young people. Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. Patrick, how thought-provoking, Luis says, feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.It's nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says hello. She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.The next day, Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can't bleach that type of sheet, and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can't understand. Lady, if you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you. She is shocked, but still won't speak English. I can't understand you! You're a fool! Stupid bitch-ee! A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. It's so silly to come all the way up here, she says, but they really are the best. Then why can't they get these stains out? he says, showing her the sheets. Can you get through to them? I'm getting nowhere. What are those? she says, looking wide-eyed at the stains. Uh, well it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple. She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes, and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he's booked solid. What about Saturday? Next Saturday? Can't. Matinee of Les Mis. He promises to call her, and then leaves.Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear, on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. You're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight? She says she's waiting for Luis to call. Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner, and when she says no, he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant, and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.In a limo, Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day, while she is almost passing out from her medication. Is that Donald Trump's car? he asks, looking out the window. Patrick's face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium, or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. I just want a child, she says, absently looking out the window. Just two... perfect... children.At the restaurant, she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. Are we here? she asks sleepily. Yeah, he says, sitting down. This is Dorsia? Yes dear, he says, opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she's going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York Matinee called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish. You'll love it. He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him, and then passes out in her chair.A conference table at P&P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there? Lucky I guess, replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. Valentino Couture? Uh-huh. Luis tries to touch it, but Patrick slaps his hand away. Your compliment was sufficient Luis. Paul Allen comes up to them. Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya? Narrating, Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for this dickhead Marcus Halberstram. They both work at P&P and do the same exact work, and wear the same glasses and suits. Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut. Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia, Marcus' girlfriend. She's great, I'm very lucky, replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in, congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. Thank you, Baxter. Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. Call me. How about Friday? says Bryce. No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche. He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he's lying. Bateman takes out his new business card, which reads Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President. What do you think? Very nice, says McDermott. I picked them up from the printers yesterday. Nice coloring, says Bryce. That's 'bone'. And the lettering is something called 'silian rail'. Cool Bateman. But that's nothing, says Van Paten, laying his card down next to Patrick's. That is really nice, says Bryce. Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think? Van Paten asks Patrick. Nice, Patrick says, visibly jealous. How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful? says Bryce. Biting his nails, Patrick can't believe Bryce prefers Van Paten's card. You ain't seen nothing yet, says Bryce, taking out his own card. Raised lettering, pale nimbus, white. Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage, Bateman tells him it's very nice. Let's see Paul Allen's card. Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room, even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating, Patrick says Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark! He drops the card on the table. Something wrong? asks Luis. Patrick? You're sweating.Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley, a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him, to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food? He starts taking out some money. I'm hungry, says the bum. It's cold out too isn't it? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job? The bum says he lost his job. Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking. He asks him his name, and the bum says his name is Al. Get a god-damn job, Al! You have a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he's a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick's arm, and Patrick pulls it off, visibly disgusted. You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that? He laughs, and then apologizes. I don't have anything in common with you. He bends down and opens his briefcase. Oh thank you mister, thank you. It's cold out here... You know what a fucking loser you are? Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach, than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick, so he stomps it with his foot, hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick's face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later, another Asian woman gives him a manicure. I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed, and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me, and I don't know why. He is lying in a tanning bed now. My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. 'Deck The Halls' is playing in the background. Patrick takes one, scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas, says Patrick. Is Allen still handling the Fisher account? He points to Paul Allen across the room. Of course. Who else? Evelyn comes up to them. Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You're late honey. I've been here the entire time, you just didn't see me. A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick's head without him noticing. Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says 'hello Patrick', she says in a childish voice. What is it? Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it? It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don't you? Don't you? Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. Stop scowling Patrick. You're such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don't say breast implants again. Ignoring her, he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. 'Joy to the World' is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas, how've you been. Workaholic I suppose? He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell's bar, and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. Cecilia would adore it. Then let's do it, Marcus. Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party, and then walks away. Why is he calling you Marcus?
 asks Evelyn. Ignoring this, Patrick says Mistletoe alert!, and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated, and he is arguing with a waiter. I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty. Patrick ignores this and orders a J&B straight and a Corona. The waiter, who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck, starts to list the specials, but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials? Not if you want to keep your spleen, says Patrick. The waiter leaves. This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot, very hot, Paul comments sarcastically. The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here, replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. I'm a child of divorce, give me a break. I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o. Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump? Patrick says, looking behind him. Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana? He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I'd have to kill ya! He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.They pick at their meals. Patrick says I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? Paul doesn't seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon, Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. You should look into it. Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. I think she's having dinner with Evelyn Williams. Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman, what a dork! Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. Another martini Paul?Patrick's apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? They're OK, says Paul. Patrick continues Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when 'Sports' came out in '83, I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically. He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. The whole album has a clear crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism, that really gives the songs a big boost! He takes a valium, washes it down, looks at himself in the mirror, and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards, he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello, but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. Hey Halberstram, says Paul. Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something? He laughs. No Allen. Is that a raincoat? Yes it is! He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song 'Hip to Be Square' starts playing. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip to Be Square'. He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. The song is so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics, but they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul! Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming, he swings it into Paul's head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor, pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard! He swings it down again, and again, screaming, decapitating him. You... fucking... bastard! He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. 'Hip to Be Square' continues to play from the stereo.Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him, and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside, and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It's Luis. Patrick. Is that you? No Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag? He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. Jean-Paul Gaultier. Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.Later, he arrives at Paul's apartment. I almost panic when I realize that Paul's place overlooks the park, and is obviously more expensive than mine. He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. It's time for Paul to take a little trip. He throws some clothes in a suitcase, and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul's voice, he records It's Paul. I've been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby. He takes the suitcase and leaves.In his office the next day, Patrick listens to the song 'The Lady in Red' by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there's someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. Who? Detective Donald Kimball. He looks through the office window. Tell him I'm at lunch. Patrick, it's only 10:30. I think he knows you're here. Send him in, I guess, he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone, giving him advice on clothes and salons. Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I've gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh, just joking. No, don't tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it. He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. No I'm sorry, I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important? Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. Mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip. They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. So, what's the topic of discussion? Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. I just have some basic questions. Patrick offers him coffee, which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water, which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. It's no problem. He asks what the topic of discussion is again, and Kimball repeats he's investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle, and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn't heard anything. I think his family wants this kept quiet. Understandable. Lime? offers Bateman. Kimball insists he's ok. He asks Patrick his age, where he went to school, and his address, the American Gardens building, which Kimball says is very nice. Thanks, Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. I'm at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing. Kimball asks him what he means. Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing. Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. You feel like that? No. Not really. Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. He had a yacht? No, he just hung out there. And where did he go to school? Don't you know this? I just wanted to know if you know. Patrick tells him St. Paul's, then says he just wants to help. I understand. Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine, and that Meredith doesn't think he went to London. Has anyone seen him in London? Actually, yes. But I'm having a hard time getting actual verification. He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet, but Kimball says no. Basically, no-one's seen or heard anything. It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... Nothing. People just disappear, says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says The earth just... opens up and swallows them. Eerie. Really eerie. Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. The Four Seasons? Isn't that a little far up town? I mean, aren't you going to be late? No, there's one down here. Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything, and shows him the door.Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then does some jump-rope.Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat, a hooker, stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she's been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. I haven't seen you around here, he tells her. Well you just haven't been looking. Would you like to see my apartment? She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. I'm not supposed to, but I can make an exception, she says, taking the money. Do you take a credit card? Just joking. He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. I'd like a girl, early 20's, blonde, who does couples. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde. He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen, and that he's going to call her Christie. You'll respond only to Christie, is that clear? She nods.Patrick's apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub, where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking. The song 'If You Don't Know Me by Now' is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. I want you to clean your vagina, he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. From behind. Get on your knees. He tells her she has a nice body, playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It's the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe, then come to the living room.He opens the door for the second girl, and takes her coat. I'm Paul. Not quite blonde, are you? More like dirty blonde. I'm going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Allen. He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no, lewdly. Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it? Sabrina shakes her head, and Patrick clenches his jaw. You have a really nice place here Paul, says Christie. How much did you pay for it? Well actually Christie, that's none of your business. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap. Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. No! No smoking in here. He offers them chocolate truffles. I don't want to get you drunk, but uh, that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking. He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, 'Duke'. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin's presence became more apparent. He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom, invitingly. I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece. The girls follow him into the bedroom. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. He tells Christie to take off the robe, which she does. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument, he says, setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to 'Land of Confusion'. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. 'In Too Deep' is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, he continues, wrapping a scarf around Christie's neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin's solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like 'In the Air Tonight' and 'Against All Odds'. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word 'artist'. He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. This is 'Sussudio', a great, great song. A personal favorite. He walks back to the bedroom, unbuttoning his shirt.He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex, then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie's arm touches his. Don't touch the watch. He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors, carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. Can we go now? asks Christie. We're not through yet.Some time later, he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina's nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.McDermott, Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them, discussing women. If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, who fucking cares? says McDermott. Well let's just say hypothetically, what if they have a good personality? replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence, and then all three men burst out laughing. There are no girls with good personalities! they say in unison, high-fiving each other. Van Paten says A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. McDermott continues: The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks. Van Paten agrees. And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are. Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar? No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50's. What did Ed say? He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.' McDermott: And what did the other part of him think? What her head would look like on a stick! Bateman laughs heartily, but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van 
Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. Is that all you ever have to contribute? snaps Bateman. Fucking dinner? McDermott tells him to cheer up. What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. Do that again and you'll draw back a stub. McDermott tells him Hang on there little buddy, but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.Putting on his leather gloves, he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking, he slowly puts his fingers around Luis' neck. Luis turns around, looks at Patrick's hands, takes off one of his gloves, and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. God. Patrick, why here? Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can't bring himself to kill Luis. I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your... hot body, Luis says, rubbing a finger over Patrick's mouth. Don't be shy. You can't imagine how long I've wanted this, ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie... Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands, with his gloves still on. He looks like he's about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. I want you. I want you too! Patrick starts walking towards the door. Patrick? WHAT IS IT? he yells. Where are you going? I've got to return some videotapes.He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs, he sees Luis make a 'call me' gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean's desk, talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. I've been wanting to talk with you, come into my office, Patrick says, shaking his hand. Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?Inside his office. Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance? asks Kimball. Which was on the 20th of December. God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes. He looks at his datebook. I had a date with a girl named Veronica. That's not what I've got, says Kimball. What? That's not the information I've received. What information have you received? I could be wrong. When was the last time you were with Paul Allen? We'd gone to a new musical called 'Oh Africa, Brave Africa'. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I've been informative. Long day. I'm a bit scattered. I'm a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so, when I've sorted out all of this information? Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it? Patrick is stunned, and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. Never. I mean I don't really like singers. Not a big music fan, huh? No I like music, just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me. To each his own. Kimball closes his briefcase. So, lunch next week? I'll be there.Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms, then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself, putting it on Courtney's lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. Will you call me before Easter? she asks. Maybe. What are you doing tonight? Dinner at uh, River Cafe. That's nice, she says, lighting a cigarette. I never knew you smoked. You never noticed. Listen, Patrick, can we talk? You look... marvelous. There's nothing to say, he says, shutting her out. You're going to marry Luis. Isn't that special... Patrick? If I don't see you before Easter, have a nice one okay? she asks, with a hint of depression in her voice. You too. He starts to leave. Patrick? Yeah? Nothing... He leaves.A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song 'Pump up the Volume' is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. There's this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected, you can catch anything. Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia! I'm not sure but I don't think dyslexia is a disease, says Bateman. But who knows? They don't know that. Prove it. Bryce snorts some white powder. Oh God. It's a fucking milligram of sweetener. Patrick sniffs some. I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal. It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay, says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs! Fuck you! says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. We'll do it anyway. That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it's okay! Fuck you! says the man. Fuck YOU! says Bryce. Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let's do it.A club balcony. The song 'What's On Your Mind' is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. He's the one behind Glasnost. Bryce makes a 'he went to get cocaine' gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions, she says. You're not confused are you? asks Bryce. No, not really. Another woman says Gorbachev is NOT downstairs. Karen's right, Gorbachev is not down stairs. He's at Tunnel. Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. So what do you do? I'm into uh, well murders and executions mostly. Do you like it? Well that depends, why? Well most guys I know, who work in mergers and acquisitions, really don't like it. He asks her where she works out.On the street, Patrick and the girl are talking. You think I'm dumb don't you. You think all models are dumb. No. I really don't. That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you. They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door, and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly, wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. Doin' the crossword? she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either 'meat' or 'bones'. She asks him if he needs any help, but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door, he says Jean, would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you're not doing anything. She says she doesn't have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. Well! Isn't this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go? She says she doesn't care where. How about anywhere you want? he tells her. I don't know Patrick, I can't make this decision. Come on! he says, chuckling and pointing his pen at her. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want, just say it, I can get us in anywhere. She thinks for a minute. How about... Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. Dorsia? Patrick looks up. So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go. I don't know, we'll go wherever you want to go. Dorsia is fine. He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. Dorsia, yes? says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at, oh, say nine o'clock? We're totally booked. Really? That's great. No I said we are totally booked! Two at nine? Perfect! See you then! He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. Yeah? he asks, taking off his sunglasses. You're... dressed okay. You didn't give a name. They know me, he lies. Why don't you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks? She smiles and starts to leave. And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.Jean looks out the window of Patrick's place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She's dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. Patrick it's so elegant. What a wonderful view. Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. Jean, sorbet? Thanks Patrick. I'd love some. He gives it to her. Do you want a bite? I'm on a diet, but thank you, he says. No need to lose any weight. You're kidding right? You look great, she tells him. Very fit. You can always be thinner... look better. Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. That's alright. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway. He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. So, what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don't tell me you enjoy working with children. She tells him she'd like to travel and maybe go back to school. I don't really know. I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities. Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. I'm just so unsure. He asks her if she has a boyfriend. No, not really. Interesting. Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? she asks. Maybe. I don't know. Not really, he says with a smile. Jean, do you feel, fulfilled? I mean, in your life? I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I've really begun to think about changing myself, developing and growing. Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. Growing. I'm glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? he laughs. Who's Ted Bundy? Forget it. What's that? Duct tape. I need it for... taping something. Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy? She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. No! Put it in the carton! Sorry. He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. I'm looking for uh... He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings, and the answering machine picks it up. It's Evelyn. Patrick... Patrick! I know you're there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight? He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope you're not out there with some number you picked up because you're MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Jean sips some wine, looking at Patrick as she listens. Anyway you never called me and you said you would, and I'll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you, but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor, you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we're meeting at the Cornell club. So I'll see you tomorrow morning honey! Patrick winces. Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye. She hangs up. Jean says Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her? He doesn't answer. I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go? Yeah, he finally says. I don't think I can control myself. I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men. She asks him if he wants her to go. I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you? No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out, she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other, eating some beef dishes. So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did? asks Kimball. I'm not sure. Uh, I had a shower, and some sorbet? I think you're getting your dates mixed up. Well, where do you place Paul that night? He tells Patrick that according to his datebook, Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram, thought Marcus denied it. Does Marcus have an alibi? Yes. I've checked it out, it's clean. Now, where were you? Well, where was Marcus? He wasn't with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Fredrick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner, and... you. Patrick looks up. Oh right, yeah, of course. Kimball makes a 'slipped your mind' gesture. We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night. Kimball says Personally, I think the guy just went a little nutso, split town for a while, maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing, drinking, whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right Patrick? he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She's standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. I'm not so sure about this, she tells him. I had to go to emergency last time. He promises that this won't be anything like last time. She says no. Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You'll be safe. He holds out some money. Reluctantly, she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. Nothing like last time. I promise, he repeats. Alright. He tells her she's looking great, and asks how she's been. I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer. Lawyers are so complicated, he says, writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her, waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it, but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again, moving over to let her get back in. Half now, half later. He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again, and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.Paul Allen's apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon, and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar, didn't I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar. She talks on and on in a self-important tone, neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. It's not that nice, he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number. What do you mean? She was a hot number. If you had a platinum card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked at a tanning salon, need I say more? She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. She's my... cousin. She's from... France, says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she's calling doesn't answer. Elizabeth, it's 3 in the morning. He's a god damn drug dealer, these are his peak hours. She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can't remember where she is. Paul Allen's. I want the number idiot. Anyway I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later, and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you. She hangs up. Did you know that guy who disappeared, didn't he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours? He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. Or a 
Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon. Listen, he says. I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*. They stare at him. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. Patrick you're a lunatic. He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood for lewd conversation. He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. You're telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? he asks Elizabeth. No. I'm not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that? Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.Some time later, the drugs having kicked in, and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply 'Whitney Houston', had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie? Elizabeth starts laughing. You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one? she laughs, falling off the couch. It's hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But 'The Greatest Love of All' is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written, about self-preservation, dignity, its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Elizabeth is still laughing. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, but we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really, and it's beautifully stated on the album.All three have sex, Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth's torso, and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets, and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room, and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open, to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick's existence finally revealed to her, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words 'DIE YUPPIE SCUM' and the room is covered with blood and faeces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead, naked woman. Patrick runs in, covered in Elizabeth's blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash! She runs through the living room and out into the hallway, pounding and screaming on neighbours' doors, but to no avail. Patrick runs after her, stark nude, and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap, waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom, he lets go, and the chainsaw falls end over end, finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn't touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him, asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. I think Evelyn, that uh, we've lost touch. Why, what's wrong? she asks, waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her, and she mouths It's beautiful. I love it. My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It's over, it's all over, he tells her, scratching a red X over his drawing. Touchy touchy. I'm sorry I brought up the wedding. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us, this is no joke, uh, I don't think we should see each other any more. But your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends. I really don't think it would work. She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth, but her stops her. I know that your friends are my friends, and I've thought about that. You can have 'em. She finally understands. You're really serious, aren't you? What about the past? Our past? We never really shared one, he replies. You're inhuman. No. I'm-I'm in touch with humanity. She starts crying. Evelyn I'm sorry, I just uh... you're not terribly important to me. She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes... What is it that you want? she cries. If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*! he snaps. Oh God I can't believe this, she weeps. I'm leaving, he says. I've assessed the situation and I'm leaving. But where are you going? I have to return some videotapes.Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. Here kitty kitty. He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: 'FEED ME A STRAY CAT'. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM, but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat's head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that! He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away, and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car, but every car on the street is locked, and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out, guns drawn. Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground! He starts to put his hands up, then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover, firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots, and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck, he looks at the gun, then at his watch, and walks away. He breaks into a run, under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? Don't forget to sign in, says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door, back into the lobby, shoots the janitor, then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat, he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen, signs in, and goes up in the elevator, crying.He reaches his office. He looks out the window, then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying, he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. Harold, it's Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know, I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10, um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man, some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... He almost can't say it. I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little. He starts laughing. Tonight I, uh, hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people! Crying again. And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. He's smiling. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open. He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen's place, putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door, he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms, and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans, ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask, stunned. Are you my 2:00? asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. No. Can I help you? I'm looking for Paul Allen's place. Doesn't he live here? No he doesn't. Did you see the ad in the Times? No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times. There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now. He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble, and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. Don't come back, she warns. I won't. Don't worry. He closes the door behind him.Outside, Bateman calls Jean from a payphone. He downs the rest of a bottle of pills while he waits for her to pick up. She answers. Jean... I need help. He sounds distraught. Patrick is that you? Craig McDermott called, he wants to meet you, Van Paten and Bryce at Harry's Bar for drinks. What did you say you dumb bitch... he croaks. Patrick I can't hear you. What am I doing? he laughs. Where are you Patrick? What's wrong? He starts crying. I don't think I'm going to... make it, Jean. To the uh, office, this afternoon. Why? She sounds worried. JUST... SAY... NO! he screams. What is it? Patrick, are you alright? Stop sounding so fucking SAD! JESUS! he screams, laughing. He hangs up, then tries to compose himself.Jean goes to Patrick's desk. She opens a drawer and finds a leather notebook. The first few pages have regular appointments. One page has a drawing of someone getting killed with a shotgun in the mouth.Patrick reaches Harry's Bar. He straightens his dishevelled hair and goes inside. Bryce, Van Paten and McDermott are sitting and drinking. McDermott tells him he looks wild-eyed. Rough day at the office? Bryce is drinking mineral water. He's a changed man! But he still can't get a reservation to save his life. Bateman tells them he isn't going anywhere unless they have a reservation. They discuss various restaurants. Bateman spots his lawyer, Harold Carnes, across the room, and excuses himself. His lawyer is telling someone how the Japanese will own most of the country by the end of the '90s. Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So uh, did you get my message? Jesus yes! That was hilarious! That *was* you, wasn't it! Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That's fabulous. That's rich. He asks him what he means. The message you left. By the way Davis, how's Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right? What do you mean? Nothing. It's good to see you. Is that Edward Towers? He starts to walk away but Bateman stops him. Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight. Now if you said Bryce, or McDermott, otherwise it was amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. For some odd reason, Carnes keeps calling Patrick Davis. Patrick angrily stops him again. I did it, Carnes! I killed him! I'm Patrick Bateman! I chopped Allen's fucking head off, he whispers with tears in his eyes. The whole message I left on your machine was true. Carnes tries to leave again. No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! He no longer sounds sure who he is. We talk on the phone all the time. Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer. He tells Carnes to listen carefully. I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer. Carnes tells him that that isn't possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. It never was supposed to be! Why isn't it possible? It's just not. Why not you stupid bastard? says Patrick. Because I had dinner with Paul Allen in London twice, just ten days ago. No you... didn't. Patrick is stunned. He begins to doubt whether he actually killed Allen or not or all those other people. Maybe it was all a fantasy. Maybe Patrick Bateman's real name is Davis. Carnes excuses himself again and he lets him go.Jean continues to look with horror through Patrick's notebook. A crude drawing of a woman getting her limbs cut off with a chainsaw. A naked woman nailed to boards. The more pages she turns, the worse the images get. Page after page is filled with shocking fantasies of rape, murder and mutilation of women.Patrick returns to the table. The guys are watching President Ronald Reagan talking about Iran-Contra on TV. How can he lie like that? says Bryce. Van Paten continues to ask where they have reservations, even though he isn't really hungry. How can he be so fucking... I don't know, cool about it? Some guys are just born cool I guess, says Van Paten. Bateman starts laughing. Bateman? What are you so fucking zany about? Ha ha, I'm just a happy camper! Rockin' and a-rollin'! Turning back to Reagan on the TV, Bryce says He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside... but inside... But inside doesn't matter,A baffled Bateman narrates: Inside, yes? Inside? Believe it or not Bryce, we're actually listening to you, says McDermott. Bryce asks Bateman what he thinks. Whatever. Van Paten says he doesn't like dry beers and needs a scotch. Bateman looks over the faces of the people in the room as he narrates. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others, and no one to escape. My punishment continues to elude me. My confession has meant nothing.

title: Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes
synopsis: Opening titles lay out the background of the story. After the conquest and plundering of the Inca Empire by Spain, natives invented the legend of El Dorado, supposedly situated in the headwaters of the Amazon. In 1560 a Spanish expedition set off from Peru. This is the story of the expedition based on the surviving diary of the monk Gaspar de Carvajal.As the film opens a narrator informs us that it is the 25th of December. The expedition has just passed the final peak of the Andes Mountains and is afforded its first glimpse at the jungle. We see hundreds descending into the Amazonian jungle- Spaniards in full armor, ladies in courtly dress, a monk, and hundreds of enslaved Indians carrying food, cannons, sedans and other supplies. The expedition reaches the bottom of the mountains. While many rest, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) and Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repullés) stand looking at the river and discuss what faces them. Aguirre maintains that no one can conquer that river, but Pizarro believes that their journey will be easier from this point forward. Aguirre says, No, from here we are all going under. We see only the raging river for nearly a minute.Their break is not long. The group quickly begins their trek through the jungle. They begin to make their way through the jungle. On his horse, Pizarro struggles to cut through the branches with his sword; Indians struggle to carry the cannon, sedan and other goods. As they struggle in the mud the Indians are accosted by Aguirre for nearly dropping the sedan carrying one of the lady travelers. The narrator states that the Indians are useless as leaders and are dropping off like flies because of colds caused by the dramatic climate changes. The expedition stops and sets up camp near the river. Pizarro delivers a speech to the entire group. They cannot continue like this- the terrain is too difficult, rations are almost depleted, and they cannot hope of finding a populated area for a long time. As such he has changed his plan. Rafts will be built and manned by 40 men- these men will seek food, information about hostile Indians, and directions to El Dorado. They will have one week to return. If they don't return, they will be assumed dead, and the remainder of the expedition will march back the way they came. Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) will be in charge of the group. His mistress Donna Inez (Helena Rojo) will accompany him. Don Lope de Aguirre will be second in command, his daughter will accompany him. Brother Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro) will go to take the word of God to the pagans, and Don Fernando (Peter Berling) will represent the royal house of Spain. Pizarro says no one who wasn't selected should feel rejected.The group sets off on three rafts; each raft is rowed by Indians. The Spanish cast wary looks as they can hear only the raging river and the calls of the birds in the jungle surrounding them. One of the rafts gets stuck in an eddy on the other side of the river. As they are swept about in continuous circles, the remaining two rafts land on the other side of the river. They watch, clustered in a group, shouting and gesturing at the other group. Their advice, however, cannot be heard.Ursua and Aguirre discuss the trapped men. Ursua wants to help the men, but Aguirre disagrees. He does not want to stop to help them. Ursua maintains that he is still the one giving orders. As Ursua walks away Aguirre softly says, Is that so?Ursua walks over to Armando, one of the only men who will stay loyal to him, and instructs him to form a rescue party. He is to take as many men and supplies as he needs and cross the river to retrieve the trapped party. The newly formed rescue group ventures into the jungle to find a point where they can cross the river. The remaining men begin to set up camp, putting up coverings made from trees they've cut down; the women relax, and the horse gets water. Darkness falls and the group is gathered around a campfire. They discuss their trapped comrades. Several shots sound. One asks if they are being signaled, another mentions that perhaps it is a battle.Morning comes and the trapped men are dead. The river is calm now and several of the men, led by the monk, venture curiously into the river. The rescue party has just arrived and looks down at the raft, now full of only dead bodies. One notes that three men are missing- two Indians and a Spaniard. Armando directs the rescue party to return to the main body. Be wary of the Indians, he warns, the jungle is infested. One man in the party lags a few feet behind the others. His foot is caught in a trap and he is silently swept up into a tree. A comrade turns to look for him, and retraces his steps. Blood drops onto his helmet and the leaf in front of him. He looks up, and is terror struck. He turns to catch up with the group and runs screaming, Indians! Help, Help!At the camp Aguirre is unnoticed by Carvajal and Ursua as they walk past. They discuss the burial of the murdered men. Carvajal thinks the men must be buried according to a proper Christian burial. Ursua agrees and allows him to begin preparations for the ceremony. The men have passed. Aguirre calls over Perucho, one of his devotees, and mentions that the cannon is looking rusty. Perucho nods and walks over to the aforementioned cannon. Whispering La, la, la, la, he blows on a ashy light and looks around. Seeing no one he shifts the cannon slightly and ignites it. The raft and the men who were left on it are blown to bits.Inez sits halfway in her sedan and addresses Ursua. She reminds him that he knows who is responsible, and if he is allowed to get away with this- what's next? Ursua nods, but tells her they have bigger problems- Indians- theyre everywhere and no one wants to die like the men on the raft. Aguirre wouldn't rebel against the Spanish crown. Inez is skeptical and reminds him that they are no longer in Castile.Aguirre speaks with his daughter Flores. He found a tiny sloth and shares it with her. It is a little animal that sleeps the entire day.Two Spaniards sleep on rocks at the rivers edge. One awakens with a start to realize that the river has flooded and wakes up his comrade. The narrator begins: the river flooded fifteen feet last night. The rafts were swept away. Men begin scouting wood to build new rafts. Iron is collected to forge nails to help hold it together. Aguirre pulls a lifeless Indian from the water and drops him shortly thereafter. Guzman shakes an Indian, demanding an answer- will he run away if Guzman loosens his chains? He gets no answer from the silent slave. A man walks by. Guzman turns his attention to the passerby and accuses him of taking his pot. The black slave advises a conquistador not to use a tree for the raft. His advice is rejected- the advisee is afraid to venture further into the hostile jungle.
As this goes on, Ursua emerges. He asks one man what he is doing, but receives no answer. Another only responds with, everyone is doing it. No one will tell him who ordered them to begin building a raft. Ursua sees Aguirre but says nothing to him. The women observe the men as they work. Flores asks Inez, What does it all mean? Inez tells her to be quiet. It's her father's fault.The men are gathered around Ursua. Ursua speaks: He has decided that they will return to Pizarro. Aguirre is heard in the background, It is not my habit to retreat. Ursua continues: They must hike because the current is too strong. Another declares the plan is suicide- they'll all be killed by Indians! Ursua ignores the interjection- they will return to Pizarro, whatever the cost. Aguirre begins again, Shit on Pizarro- we can conquer without him. Perucho reminds them that this is why they built the rafts this morning. Aguirre calls Cortez to their attention. The great Spanish conquerer only became so renowned because he disregarded his orders. Ursua repeatedly orders Silence! But to no avail. He orders Aguirre put in chains, but is shot in the abdomen. Inez rushes to his side. His loyal Armando draws a sword, but he too is shot. Aguirre orders silence asking if anyone else wishes to join Ursua and Armando. Everyone stands silently. One begins to speak wondering what will happen now? Perhaps there are waterfalls downriver, questions another. What does it matter so long as they get closer to El Dorado, interjects another. Another man notices Ursuas fist is clenched. Surely Ursua will be killed, he mentions, but no one is willing to help him.An Indian plays a flute while Aguirre watches him.Armando is confined to chains in a jail constructed out of tree branches. Inez comforts Ursua.Monk Caspar de Carvajal sits on a rock at the river's edge. Inez approaches him. He is their last hope; Aguirre will kill Ursua and Armando. Carvajal can only console her a little- God is always on the side of the strong.Aguirre approaches Armando's cell. We want you on our side. We need men like you. He circles the cell, thwarting Armando's attempts to avoid his gaze. Think about it- but not too long. Aguirre gathers the men for a speech. They've rid themselves of the troublemakers, now it is time to elect a leader. The choice is clear- Don Fernando de Guzman. Guzman appears confused by the nomination. Perucho immediately set forth a formal proposal among the group to elect Guzman. Aguirre glares at each of the men until they reluctantly raise their hands and the decision is unanimous. Perucho elects Aguirre to remain second in command, the group agrees.Balthasar, one of the Indian slaves, speaks with Flores. He has survived plagues and floods, but what the Spanish have done to him is far worse. They named him Balthasar, his name was Runo Rimac. He was a prince before, and no one could look him in the eye. Now he is a slave like his people were. He feels sorry for Flores though, because there is no escape from this. The men sit and eat. Inez brings Armando some food to eat in his cell. While feeding him through the bars of his jail, Perucho hovers around them taunting them with a steady, la, la, la, la, la. Armando inquires quietly about how Ursua is doing. Inez does not reply.Aguirre rises to address the group again. Their position must be made legal. He orders Gaspar de Carvajal to read a document. Gaspar reads- The article addresses the king. Until yesterday these men considered themselves in the king's service. Fate, Gods Help, and their own work carried them down the river, but now they are 200 miles from Pizarro. Now they will share none of the fruits of their conquest with the Spanish crown. We Rebel Until Death. May our hands perish and our tongues dry up if this is not so. The house of Habsburg is overthrown and Phillip the Second is dethroned. By this declaration you are annihilated. Guzman is king of El Dorado. God Bless.Aguirre seizes the document from Carvajal. He declares that fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward. The reluctant King Guzman is shown his throne- merely two pieces of wood with a bit of velvet thrown over it. Scoffing, he asks if this is really to be his throne. Aguirre assures him it is as he forcibly seats him in it. Guzman sits there and begins to tear up. Aguirre inspects the jail cell. Armando has escaped, and the guard is dead.Guzman sits on a bench in the river, washed and massaged by two men. Aguirre comes up behind him and warns that so long as Ursua lives, his life will be in danger. Ursua still has sympathizers within the group. Guzman declares that so long as he is king, law will prevail. There should be a trial. Fine, hisses Aguirre. Try him. Then kill him.Gaspar de Carvajal leads the trial. Perucho testifies that Ursua will say nothing. No one can take what is clenched in his fist, to do so they would have to cut off his hand. Balthasar testifies that he and other Indians have received money from Ursua; Okello testifies that he has received money as well though he is not really sure as to why. Ursua is called on for a defense. Defiant, however, he says nothing. Inez sits next to him. She rises to speak. Back in Spain they paid their servant. Surely they should do the same here, even if they are Indians. Carvajal dismisses her calling her a confused child, no one will hold her testimony against her.Carvajal speaks. He declares that Ursua has been found guilty of treason and will be sentenced to death. Guzman, sitting behind him on a throne confirms the verdict and a confident Aguirre begins to walk away. He turns around, eyes wide and raging, as Guzman begins speaking again. Today is the anniversary of the last moor leaving Spain. He will grant Ursua clemency, but he forfeits all rights as a citizen. His portion will be divided- half for the church, half among the best soldiers. The following day the party continues down the river on their newly built raft. Ursua reclines by Inez, he still refuses to speak, and has begun to lose his vision. It's noon and the party spots a fire on the banks of the river. A village is burning. Aguirre sets up an attack. Okello, the black slave, is stripped save for a loin cloth, so he can scare the Indians. The group lands and, prodded by the Spaniards behind him, Okello reluctantly runs in front of them into the village. The men grab at fruit, and are admonished- they must conquer. King Guzman sits on the edge of a platform eating ripe fruit. As they discover a bucket with human skulls, and a mummy, they realize they are in a village where cannibals lived. Grabbing what little food they can, the disturbed group quickly returns to the raft and begins again to venture down the river.The river comes to a near standstill. Weary adventurers seek refuge under newly built thatched roofs. Inez warns Aguirre as he walks past- She knows his intent to kill Urusa, and God in heaven will punish him for it. Silence falls over the raft as they see Indians on the distant shore. One man is shot and dies. A perturbed Aguirre orders the men to shoot at anything to break the ominous silence. Noting the men are stilled unsettled, Aguirre orders an Indian slave to play the flute for them.Two Indians, a man and a woman, paddle over to the raft in a canoe. The Spaniards are wary of a trap, but pull them up onto the raft. The man explains with Balthasar as a translator that they have long awaited the foretold arrival of the white man with sticks that throw lightning.Guzman listens, but is quickly distracted and focuses only on the gold pendant he rips from the mans neck. They demand to know where the gold came from. The Indian's only answer is that gold is father downriver.
Gaspar de Carvajal steps forward to show the pair a Bible. He holds it up explaining that this is the word of God. He hands it to the man, who takes it and, confused, holds it against his ear. He tells the Spaniards that he hears nothing. Accused of blasphemy, he is killed. Carvajal comments that it is difficult to convert these heathens.Given hope the group begins to dream of the riches of El Dorado. Gold abounds, they have governorships, provinces and Okello even dreams of freedom. While tracing out a map Guzman declares that all the land to the left and to the right is the property of El Dorado. Every day they drift his kingdom grows larger.Okello fixes dinner for Guzman- fish stuffed with fruits and cooked over a fire. Upon being served, Guzman whines that he has no salt and holds out his cup as if expecting wine at a fine dinner. The men behind him however, are counting out the last grains they have. Today there are only ten grains per man. The horse is frightened and begins to thrash around kicking and stomping. Angry that his meal was disturbed, Guzman orders the horse off the raft. The men shove the horse off of the raft and ignore its attempt to get back on. The horse swims to the bank and stands on land the raft floats away. Carvajal muses with Perucho, that Guzman is a dead man. The sight of a horse could scare away armies of Indians, and the horse was meat for a week. Shortly thereafter Guzman is found dead just outside the raft's outhouse.Ursuas fate is sealed by Guzman's death. He is taken by Perucho and two others inland via canoe. Here, they find a tree barely able to hold his weight on its spindly branches, hoist him up so they can tie the rope down, and let him hang. Perucho sits on a branch below him and eats while reciting nonsense, waiting for Ursua to die.With all of its remaining members on board the raft keep moving slowly down the river. They approach a new group of Indians who, according to Balthasars translation, shout, Meat, Meat! Meat is floating by! As the Spaniards land, arrows fly. Spaniards shoot at Indians and light the village on fire. Starving men are soon distracted and begin to lick up salt from the ground. Suddenly a beautifully adorned Inez emerges and walks calmly and alone into the jungle. The attack is complete, and Perucho reports to Aguirre. They followed Inez's tracks a half mile into the jungle but saw neither her nor the Indians. The men accompanying him panicked at the silence and returned to the camp. As he reports a voice comes from the background. A man is plotting to return to Pizarro. He has counted the bends in the river and will travel by night and hide by day to avoid the Indians. Aguirre hears the traitor and comments to Perucho that the man speaking is a head taller than himself, and that should soon change. Perucho walks quietly over and slices the oblivious man's head off mid-sentence. Aguirre speaks- he is the greatest traitor, there will be no greater. The earth bows to his will. Anyone who attempts to leave will die. The group returns to the raft to continue downstream. As they float along, two more men are picked off by the arrows of Indians.Gaspar de Carvajal speaks with Aguirre about morale. They see nothing but death but never see their enemy. Perhaps even El Dorado is an illusion. Aguirre, however, will not have it. Mexico was no illusion, and if they give up then someone else will come along later and take it. Power and Fame are riches as well. Carvajal muses that Aguirre is leading them to their destruction- perhaps even doing so intentionally.Weeks later unbearable suffering is rampant among the men. Many are struck with fever and hallucinations due to hunger and illness. Okello sees a ship with sails in a tree. Carvajal dismisses this as a hallucination. Aguirre, however, is convinced that they will retrieve the ship and go to the Atlantic. Carvajal dares to defy him- the men are sick and near dying. They will not go with Aguirre. Okello is struck by an arrow, then Carvajal. They believe, however, that these are illusions and don't move. Flores walks to the edge of the raft and is struck by an arrow as she looks into the trees in front of her. Aguirre walks over and takes her in his arms. She dies quietly and motionless in Aguirres arms.Monkeys suddenly appear all over the raft and Aguirre follows them around the raft. He speaks- He will reach the Atlantic, take Trinidad from Spain, and Mexico from Cortez. They will have all of New Spain. He will marry his own daughter and found a pure dynasty. They will rule the entire continent together and endure. The film closes with Aguirre being the only person clearly alive. The camera circles him until the credits roll.

title: Shutter Island
synopsis: U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are on a ferryboat in foggy Boston Harbour headed towards Shutter Island, an island containing a federal mental hospital for the criminally insane. They are going to the island because a woman patient named Rachel escaped the day before. Teddy is very ill, sweating and throwing up in the toilet, telling himself to get it together, it's just water. Then he looks out the window and says it's a LOT of water. He goes up on deck to talk to Chuck, and it's apparent that they are new partners working for the first time together. During their conversation it is revealed that Teddy's wife died in an apartment fire several years before. Chuck is sorry he brought it up. He refers to Teddy as boss all the way through the movie, and at one point mentions that Teddy is a legend, so we know that Teddy is well known through the Marshal Service and that he is Chuck's superior.They get to the island, and the ferry captain mentions that there is a big storm coming. Teddy and Chuck meet the deputy warden, McPherson, who takes them into the mental hospital grounds. There are high walls that make it look like a prison, and electrified wire on the perimeter, but the actual buildings and grounds look almost like a college campus. There is the A building, housing the male patients, B building for the women patients, and C building which is situated on the highest point of the island and we are told it was a civil war fortress. It houses the most dangerous patients and the marshals are told that under no circumstances are they to go there on their own without McPherson and Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) accompanying them. There is a brief argument when deputy warden McPherson requires them to give up their firearms. Teddy says that they are federal agents, but McPherson tells them that federal penitentiary law overrides that and says that they won't get through the gates with their weapons. They reluctantly give them up, with Chuck rather clumsily removing his holster from his pants, which gets him a look from McPherson and Teddy.They meet Dr. Cawley, who explains a bit about the facility and psychiatry. Dr. Cawley says that there is a war going on in psychiatry, with one faction who believes in surgical techniques like lobotomies to treat patients, where another side says that the new psychotropic drugs are the way to treat people. He believes that sometimes just listening to a patient and quietly making their life comfortable is the way to go. Teddy still has a splitting headache from the ferry trip, and the doctor gives him some water and some pills that he says are aspirin. He explains that Rachel, a patient, has escaped the night before but says that it's impossible because she seems to have simply vanished through the walls. She is at Shutter Island because she drowned three of her children one by one, and then pretended that they had never died. In fact, she believes that she is still at her home at the hospital, and all of the staff and other inmates are merely neighbours or deliverymen that she encounters in her daily life. She refuses to accept that she has killed anyone, or even that her children are dead.They tour the rest of the island, where officers are looking for the escaped Rachel. There is a lighthouse on the other side of the island that is gated off and there are armed guards, which makes Teddy a little suspicious.Teddy makes it clear that his job is to interview staff and patients. He says he needs the personnel records of the staff, but the doctor kind of blows that off. They go to the patient living quarters and interview staff about the night that Rachel left. In her cell, there is a loose floorboard and a handwritten note from her, saying The law of 4. Who is 67?. The staff are less than helpful at the meeting that Teddy and Chuck have to ask about her, but do note that she had attended group therapy right before she went to her room and disappeared. During the meeting, it is revealed that she has a staff physician who conducted the meeting, a Dr. Shaheen. When Teddy asks where he is, Dr. Cawley says he just left that morning on the ferry to go on a long planned vacation. Teddy is incredulous that a dangerous mental patient has just escaped, there's a lockdown, and her doctor is allowed to just go on vacation. Things definitely look suspicious at this point.There are a series of dream sequences interspersed, flashbacks about Teddy's time in WWII as a soldier, and Teddy often has internal conversations with himself in which his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), talks to him and gives him advice. In one flashback, Teddy's unit is the first to liberate the Dachau concentration camp. There are many dead Jews. Teddy is especially moved by a dead woman and her dead daughter in her arms in the middle of a pile of dead bodies. Teddy remembers watching the German Camp Commander attempt suicide by shooting himself, but he only wounds himself, shooting himself in the side of his face. The German tries to reach his gun to finish the job, but Teddy slowly slides the gun away with his foot just out of reach of the German, watching him suffer before he bleeds to death. In other dreams, his wife discovering that he has a lot of empty bottles of alcohol that he has hidden around the house. He explains that the things he saw while in Germany are the reason why he drinks so much.After the meeting with staff, Dr. Cawley has Teddy and Chuck over to his mansion on the island to have a cigar and something to drink. When they arrive, there is a Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) in the den, and he seems to be Dr. Cawley's superior. Teddy takes an instant dislike to him when he notices a faint German accent, and the two verbally spar for a little bit. Dr. Naehring is amused, commenting on Teddy's remarkable defence mechanisms. Dr. Naehring calls Teddy and Chuck men of violence, which offends Chuck. But the doctor says he doesn't mean that they are violent men, only that they are men who have seen violence and don't shy away from it if necessary. He correctly surmises that they were both in the army during WWII, and that they weren't raised to run away from violence. Teddy gets angry when they say that they've consulted the board of directors who have refused to release the staff's personnel records, angry enough that Teddy breaks a glass, threatens to end the investigation in the morning and turn his findings over to the FBI, and storms off in a huff.The next day, the storm has hit the island and it is clear the ferry will not arrive. Teddy was only bluffing the night before as he has no intention of leaving without investigating the island some more. Teddy and Chuck have several interviews with the patients who were in the group therapy session with Rachel. They are unhelpful and all seem to be following a script because they say very similar things in their interviews. In one interview, a woman asks Chuck for a glass of water and when he leaves, she grabs Teddy's notebook and writes something very quickly and gives it back to him.He and Chuck leave the hospital grounds and explore the island, ending up at the cemetery. The wind and rain are picking up and they find sanctuary in a cemetery vault. Chuck asks Teddy to level with him; he suspects that the last patient told him something while he was getting her water, and Teddy finally shows him the notebook, and it says RUN. Teddy finally explains that he was trying to get assigned to an investigation of the mental hospital for some time. He says that a man named Laeddis was a maintenance worker at the apartment they lived in and he was the arsonist who set the fire that killed his wife. He got off on a technicality, but later was caught when he killed some other people. He was sent to the mental hospital here. But when Teddy looked into it, there was no paperwork at all for Laeddis, and he suspects that there is some greater conspiracy going on. He mentions the Nazi experiments and wonders if his own government is involved in psychotropic drug research as well. He tells Chuck that he came across a prisoner by the name of George Noyce who was actually sent here some time before and he was the one who clued Teddy in that there was some crazy research going on here.Chuck suddenly gets paranoid that maybe in all of Teddy's poking around he alerted the wrong people to his interest in Shutter Island and that maybe they arranged the disappearance of Rachel as an excuse to draw him here as a Marshal to investigate where they could make both of them disappear. Teddy is not sure that's possible, but Chuck is pretty convincing and suddenly, the door busts in and there is a car spotlight on them from dep. Warden McPherson's car. Hes been looking for them and they get in and he takes them back to the hospital. They change out of their wet business suits, and the orderly gives them the staff white uniforms that almost make them look like patients, and he tells them that it will take a day or two to get their suits back. They don't like the whites but take them anyway. The orderly says their cigarettes were ruined (they both smoke a lot), but he gives them two new packs of cigs.They meet in Dr. Cawley's office again. They argue briefly about the investigation, and suddenly Teddy gets ill again, a migraine. He thinks he'll be okay, but then he starts to fall and Chuck catches him. The doctor gives him a couple of pills, but Teddy doesn't want to take them. Hes really sick, though, and the doctor almost insists that he take them, and he does. Chuck helps him down to the basement with all the rest of the staff to wait out the hurricane like storm. Just before he dozes off, he sees a sinister looking guy, who an orderly says is the warden (Ted Levine, the killer from Silence of the Lambs). The warden kind of sneers at Teddy right before Teddy falls asleep.Teddy has another dream sequence with his wife, who tells him that Rachel is on the island, and that he needs to help her. In a dream, Teddy is in Dr. Cawley's den, and Laeddis (Elias Koteas) in his chair by the fire. Laeddis has a really nasty scar running from his right eye down to the left side of his chin, and his left eye is milky white.The next day is kind of chaotic. The backup generators fail, and all of the patients' cell doors were therefore opened. Trees are fallen all over the hospital campus with staff and officers trying to clean up as well as gather up all of the wandering patients. Teddy and Chuck use this as an opportunity to go up to C building while no one is really paying attention to them. The place is really dark inside and they wander around. A patient runs from them and they give chase. Chuck falls behind and the patient grabs Teddy from behind and is choking him. Teddy gets away and beats the crap out of him until Chuck pulls him off. A guard chews out Teddy and has Chuck help him take the patient to the medical centre, telling Teddy to take a walk and cool off.Teddy wanders around and finds a row of cells where a prisoner is sitting by himself and saying the name Laeddis. When Teddy demands the prisoner look at him, he realizes it is George Noyce, the guy who was a former patient here who told him about what was going on at Shutter Island. Noyce's face is badly beaten. Teddy can't believe he is back here and Noyce is yelling at him that its all about Laeddis, isn't it? He tells Teddy that the only way he can save Noyce is to forget his wife and Laeddis and focus on what is going on here. Teddy looks guilty when Noyce tells him it is his fault that Noyce is back here because he kept inquiring about Laeddis. Teddy promises that he'll get Noyce out of there. Noyce tells him that Laeddis is no longer in C building, but that they have taken him to the lighthouse, where they are planning to do a lobotomy on him. He says that the lighthouse is where they do a lot of their experiments on people who are troublemakers. Noyce questions him about Noyce, implying that he is a plant by the government to follow Teddy. He asks him whether hes ever worked with Chuck before, and we know that they haven't because they let us know that in the beginning.Teddy finally catches up with Chuck and they head towards the office. Dr. Cawley says they found Rachel (Emily Mortimer). They go to her cell and there is a weird scene where Teddy tries to talk to her and she ultimately thinks he is her dead husband and starts yelling at him.At some point, Teddy's dream sequences now include Rachel as the woman with her daughter in the pile of bodies at Dachau. And this time they open their eyes and look at him. The girl asks him why he didn't save her. He says he tried but they (the soldiers) just didnt get there in time. In another scene, Rachel is all bloody but she is at Teddy and his wife's vacation cottage. They go outside and Teddy sees the little girl and picks her up and carries her to the water. The little girl asks him again why he didn't save her and he looks sad.Teddy and Chuck leave and Chuck says he found Laeddis's file but there was only his commitment paper in the file which he tries to show Teddy but he wont look at it now because he is intent on reaching the lighthouse. Teddy is acting suspicious of Chuck when he tries to talk him out of going to the lighthouse. They arrive at the cliffs over the ocean and realize they are too far south of the lighthouse. Teddy says he is going to go around and try to get there a different way. Again Chuck tries to talk him out of it because it's dangerous to scale the cliffs when it will be dark soon. They argue some more and Teddy tells him he is going by himself. Teddy gets near the lighthouse but finds that it is late enough in the day that the tide has cut off the lighthouse from the island. He gives up and goes back to where Chuck is to tell him they'll try later. But all he sees is a burning cigarette on the edge of the cliff (it's about a hundred feet down to the rocks below). He looks over and sees Chuck at the bottom of the cliff with waves crashing over him.Shocked, Teddy climbs down the cliff but doesn't see Chuck at the bottom. He sees a cave in the side of the cliff with a fire burning inside. When he reaches the cave, he sees a woman armed with a knife. They begin talking and she says she is Rachel (Patricia Clarkson), but that she was a doctor at the hospital who found out too much and they committed her and concocted a story that she killed her kids. The other Rachel must be an imposter they used to fool Teddy and Chuck. She says there is a secret government program to test a number of new drugs on the patients to make them sort of super spies or soldiers who don't feel pain and don't have memories that can be tortured out of them if they are captured. She then warns Teddy that they will not let him leave. They will concoct a story that he went crazy. She asks him if he had a serious trauma (his wife dying), and says that they will use that to say that he cracked. She asks him if he has taken any medication (he has; the aspirin for his headaches). She asks if he's eaten at the hospital, or smoked any of their cigarettes (the orderly gave him a new pack when his clothes were all wet). She says that it takes 36-48 hours for psychotropic drugs to take effect and make him pliable for them to control. The first sign will be tremors in his hands, which he already has. She also questions whether Chuck is even a Marshal, that he is probably a government agent sent to go with him to the island.When Teddy gets back to the road, he sees a jeep pull up with the warden. The warden takes him back to the facility and they have a really weird conversation about being men of violence. The warden tells him that men like them know how to use violence and use it well. He asks Teddy if he were to reach over and try to bite his eye out, would Teddy be able to stop him. Teddy says why don't you try and well find out?. The warden smiles and says that's the Teddy he was expecting.Teddy leaves to confront Dr. Cawley. Dr. Cawley wonders where Teddy has been. Teddy says he'll be leaving and he asks if the doctor has seen Chuck, his partner. Dr. Cawley says he came to the island alone, there was no partner. Teddy realizes that they are already starting to put their plan in action by insisting there was no Chuck. He leaves and walks around the grounds, trying to decide what to do next. He sees his wife, who tells him to leave the island and don't go to the lighthouse. She says the lighthouse will destroy him.He decides to blow up Dr. Cawley's car to create a diversion so he can sneak down to the lighthouse. He uses his tie from his suit, soaks it with gas from the gas tank, and lights it. As he moves away from the car, he sees his wife and the little girl in front of the car. It explodes around them but they aren't burned at all. He runs out of there to make it to the lighthouse. He swims over to it, and sneaks up behind a guard and overpowers him and takes his rifle. The guard asks him if he is going to kill him and he says no, but hits him with the rifle butt and knocks him out. He runs up the stairs of the lighthouse to the top, checking each room but finding no operating rooms for surgical experiments.He gets to the top and finds Dr. Cawley, sitting behind a desk. Teddy holds the rifle on him while he is talking. The doctor tells him there are no bullets in the rifle, and asks him if he killed the guard below. Teddy says no, but the doctor calls down anyway to tell the people below to attend to the guard before they come up. Teddy sees his gun from the beginning of the movie on the doctors desk.Dr. Cawley tells Teddy that he is a patient at the hospital, and has been for two years. Teddy doesn't believe him, and says that he is a U.S. Marshal. The doctor says he was one, but after his breakdown two years ago he was sent here. He broke down when his kids were killed. Teddy says he doesn't have any kids. Dr. Cawley says they have been trying to use the new drug therapy to help him and have been trying to do everything they could to treat him. Dr. Cawley tells him that he has been one of the most dangerous patients they have had and that there are some who want to lobotomize him to make him manageable. The whole last couple of days were an attempt to do a massive role-play to get him to finally realize the truth. He calls in Dr. Sheehan, the doctor from the beginning that went on vacation right after his patient Rachel disappeared. The door opens and it is .Chuck! He is a psychiatrist who agreed to play along with Teddy's fantasy and to keep tabs on him. Dr. Cawley tells Teddy that his real name is Laeddis, and he shows him on a chalkboard that his full name and Laeddis's are an anagram; that is, all the letters in his name can be rearranged to spell Laeddis's full name. The same thing with his wife's name and Rachel's. Teddy constructed the new name Teddy Daniels to create distance from his real name.The doctor points out that Noyce was a fellow patient who Teddy attacked a few days before, and that was why he was all beaten up looking. Teddy denies this, but the doctor shows him the transcript of what Noyce said to him in the cell earlier, where he said this was all Teddy's fault. He tells Teddy that the reason why he beat up Noyce was that Noyce called him by his real name.Teddy grabs his gun off the table and shoots Dr. Cawley, whose blood splashes against the wall. The next second, there is no blood. Dr. Cawley tells him that his gun was a toy gun they gave him when they began the role-play.He tells Teddy that he has completely erased everything he did wrong in an attempt to make himself be the hero. We finally see a flashback where Teddy/Laeddis comes home to his cottage from a week or two of chasing bad guys in Oklahoma. His wife (Michelle Williams) is acting strangely. He asks where the kids are and she says they are in school. He says it's Saturday, and she smiles and says, they're in HER school and looks towards the lake. Horrified, Teddy runs down to the lake and sees his three children face down in the lake. He scoops them all up, crying uncontrollably and places them on the ground. Then his wife hugs him and says they should put the kids at the dining room table and have dinner. Teddy is crying and says if she ever loved him, please stop talking. She is sad now and says she loves him and then there is a shot. Teddy looks down and realizes that he just shot his wife. She is laying there with a lot of blood on her and then she dies.Teddy now realizes that he has a choice between accepting his truth or continuing to deny it. The doctor makes it clear that if he can't accept the truth, then Dr. Cawley won't be able to stop the other doctors from ordering that he be lobotomized. He makes Teddy admit that he blamed himself for not realizing earlier that his wife was having trouble. That he feels responsible for killing his kids because he didn't get her help when she needed it. He created a fantasy world where he never killed his wife, and he never had a breakdown.The next day, he and Chuck (Dr. Shaheen), are sitting on some steps by the hospital grounds. He asks Chuck what their next move is (as if he still believes he is investigating the hospital as a U.S. Marshal), and Chuck says, what do you think, boss? Chuck nods to the other doctors across the grounds who then direct some orderlies to move towards Teddy. Teddy asks Chuck whether it's better to live as a monster or die a good man. He stands up and willingly goes with the orderlies, as he would rather choose to continue his fantasy than accept the horrors of his reality.Alternatively, he has accepted his reality, but still cannot live with the horrors of it. So now at the end of the film he is actually acting out the fantasy, rather than living it. Effectively, he is cured. However, he still can't live with his memories so he knowingly forces the doctors to take the decision for physical intervention, ie the lobotomy, knowing he will no longer have to live with his memories as a compliant 'zombie'..Thus ending his life as a good man.(As contrary in the Book,where the author ended the book with him still as Teddy)

title: Slumber Party Massacre III
synopsis: The opening credits show a montage of photos. The final image shows a still black-and-white photograph of Uncle Billy with a young Ken. The screen stays focused on it, zooming into the screen.
Then, it cuts to a group of teenage friends are playing volleyball at a Los Angeles beach. Jackie is sitting with Diane talking when a strange man appears and sits at the beach near them and stares at the girls. Duncan yells to the weirdo and tells him to keep his eyes to himself. Duncan then mentions to Diana and Jackie about a party, but they tell him that it is a slumber party and guys are not invited. Juliette goes to get the volleyball and talks to her boyfriend Ken. As they are leaving, Jackie goes back to pick up something and drops her address book. When Sarah gets into her car, she is grabbed by an unseen person and a drill is run through her stomach from behind the car seat, killing her.
Frank drives Jackie home and they kiss for a minute. When Jackie approaches the front door, they see that it is wide open. Inside the house is Morgan, who though it was an open house since Jackie's parents are moving. Jackie says that he can stay and look around for a while. After Jackie listens to messages from her mom and Morgan on her answering machine, an apparently nervous Morgan finally leaves.
Later, Jackie's friends arrive for the slumber party and telling her that Sarah did not answer at home and suggests that she may have flaked out on them. Morgan calls the girls (while he is spying on them through a telescope from his house across the street) and he asks Jackie if he can look at the house again. Jackie responds negatively. A little later, when Juliette and Maria playfully perform a striptease, Frank, Tom, and Michael scare them with masks. Jackie tells the guys to leave.
The weirdo from the beach is hanging outside the house, spying on the girls. Frank and Tom go to get something for the girls, and Michael goes to apologize for scaring them. He knocks on the front door, and girls ignore him. When he walks away he has an encounter with a masked person and he runs back to the door and bangs for help. He gets impaled with a house for sale sign post. The masked killer drags his body away and returns the post to the front yard.
A little later, Ken calls Juliette wanting to speak with her, and she invites him over. Duncan waits outside and sees a pizza delivery girl arriving with a pizza. He bribes the pizza girl to switch shirts and let him have the pizza. Duncan delivers the pizza to the girls and to say I'm sorry to them for the prank earlier. The girls let him into the house. The pizza girl (wearing Duncan's shirt) is walking down the street when she is chased by the unseen killer and is pushed to the ground and drilled numerous times through her stomach.
At the house, Jackie is talking with Diane when they hear a noise and see the weirdo outside. Jackie calls the police, but Officer O'Reilly on the other end of the line thinks that it's just a bunch of girls with overactive imaginations. The girls let Frank and Tom inside, and Ken appears right behind them and enters the house too. Frank gives Jackie some flowers and apologizes. Meanwhile, the weirdo from the beach gets into the basement.
Susie shows her boyfriend, Tom, a swordfish on display in the basement and the two of them kiss. Upstairs, Juliette is upstairs making out with Ken and when her hand moves over to his crotch, he stops her. Janie hears them and tells the others they're doing it! Tom accidentally drops the pizza on the carpet and Susie gets some bleach to clean it up. Juliette goes into the bathroom to shower, and Ken leaves. She finds a vibrator in the bathroom, she plugs it in and laughs. While Juliette is in the bathtub, the lights go out and someone enters the bathroom, turns on the vibrator, and throws it into the bath water, electrocuting Juliette.
A few minutes later, Maria enters the bathroom, dries up some of the water that is on the floor, opens up a closet to get another towel and finds the dead Juliette. The group gathers together in the living room and Maria suggests that the weirdo from the beach killed their friend. Jackie calls the police again, but Officer O'Reilly still does not take their call seriously and hangs up. Ken suggests that he make a run for it and find his uncle, who used to be a police officer. As he runs out the front door, Tom joins him. As the two are running down the street, Ken stops by a lumberyard and suggests getting tools for better weapons. Tom finds a sledgehammer and gives it to Ken, who suddenly whacks Tom with it. Tom and Ken fight until Ken finally gets a chain saw and slices into Tom's legs. After Ken leaves, Tom sits up and begins to crawl away.
Back at the house, Jackie goes with Frank to check the basement. After seeing the swordfish with the sword broken off, they find the missing piece sticking in the dead weirdo in a trunk. They realize that the weirdo is not the killer. Just then Ken calls the house from a payphone where he tells them that his uncle said it would be safer to stay inside the house. After Ken hangs up, he goes to a van and inside are photos of his cop uncle, the dead bodies... and the drill. Ken is the driller killer.
Back at the house, Duncan goes to answer a knock on the front door and Ken barges in and drills him in the chest. Frank jumps on Ken from behind and the two men struggle. Morgan (still looking through his telescope) calls the police and reports a disturbance. Jackie hits Ken with a lamp, and Frank is knocked down by the drill. Jackie sits by Frank and tells Ken that he killed him. The other girls run but cannot get the back door open (because Ken had apparently lodged something between the sliding doors). Maria is separated from them and Ken approaches her. She sees Tom dead by the window having bled to death after crawling back to the house. Janine runs in and knocks Ken on the head with a glass bowl. Janine and Maria run to the door, but Maria is swiped by Ken's drill. Janine jumps through the glass back door and collapses on the patio. Ken proceeds to kill her.
Ken goes upstairs to look for the remaining girls. He walks into a room where the wounded Maria and terrified Susie are hiding. He finds Susie in a closet, pulls her out, and throws her onto a bed where he hits her. After Maria comes out of hiding, she hits Ken on the head with a lamp. Maria, Jackie, and Diane run down into the basement. They try crawling out of a window to escape, but Ken appears. Jackie shoots him with a spear gun, hitting him in the leg. They run back upstairs and find the dead Janine and her innards on the patio. When the wounded and angry Ken staggers up from the basement, Susie pours liquid bleach in a bucket and throws it at his face, blinding him. He swings wildly with his drill and hits Maria again, who pleads with Ken not to kill her. She says she knows he has been hurt and she seems to relax him by letting him touch her. He blindly gets on top of her, and Maria reaches for the drill. Ken becomes upset when her other hand moves around too much and correctly assuming she's trying to get at the drill, he manages to get to it first and kills Maria.
Still blinded, Ken hears Susie's voice coming from the kitchen. Jackie and Diane are standing by the front door to the kitchen waiting for him to make his move. Ken heads for Susie until Diane calls out and gets his attention. They knock the drill away from Ken and throw a volleyball net over him, while Diane whacks him with a baseball bat until he is knocked out. Having finally subdued him, Jackie goes to call the police in the next room. Ken wakes up and his vision begins to return as Susie and Diane stand guard over him. Ken thinks back to his insane Uncle Billy whom apparently motivated him to become the killer that he is. Ken then jumps up and grabs Diane. Susie tries to stab him, but he knocks her to the side and fatally stabs Diane to death. Jackie runs in, seizes the drill and kills Ken.
Relieved that it's finally over, Jackie finds on the dead Ken a photograph of Uncle Billy with a young Ken. Dropping the picture, she and Susie leave the scene, just as a police officer knocks on their door. The final shot shows the picture, which then appears in the screen accompanied with Uncle Billy's laugh. It then fades out and the credits roll.

title: Nymphomaniac: Vol. I
synopsis: The film starts with a repetitive sound effect in the dark. Its finally revealed to be machinery pounded by rainfall. After several minutes of this, we see an unmoving hand on the pavement.The peaceful sounds of the wind and rain is taken over by loud heavy metal music on the soundtrack. We see inside someone's house. The man (Stellan Skarsgård) puts on a scarf and goes on a walk. He picks up some bait from a tackle store, then makes his way home. He stumbles upon what is revealed to be an unconscious middle-aged woman (Charlotte Gainsbourg) on the ground. He wakes her up; she is badly beaten and bloody. He tells her to lie still and hell get an ambulance. She tells him 'no', she doesn't need an ambulance and if he calls for one or the police, she will leave before he can return. He points out she is hurt and asks if she wants anything and she asks for a cup of tea and milk. He takes her inside his home.Inside, she drinks some tea. He tells her he will wash her clothes; she asks him not to wash the coat. He asks what happened and asks if she was robbed. She says it's her fault because she's a bad human being. He asks her if she wants to talk about it. She says she doesn't know were to start and then notices he has a fly on a fishhook, on the wall. He tells her about fly-fishing, how the fly resembles something the fish like to eat and because its light, the line has to be heavy. She asks if he fishes a lot and he says he doesn't catch much. He tells her he used to love a fishing book as a kid, The Complete Angler, which was a romantic Bible to him. She then realizes she knows where to start and says shell have to tell him the whole, long story.CHAPTER ONE: THE COMPLETE ANGLERThe woman explains that she discovered her bait, her cunt, as a two year old. Five years later, she and her girl friend, B, lock themselves in the bathroom, take off their underwear, fill the floor with water, then slide around, rubbing themselves on the floor. The girl's mother, Katherine (Connie Nielsen), knocks on the door and the young girls quickly mop up. The woman says she loved her father, a doctor, very much but her mother was a cold bitch who always had a bad turn when she played Solitaire. In P.E., the narrator enjoyed climbing the rope for the sensation of it hanging between her legs. She says the only difference between her and other people is she always demanded more from the sunset, more spectacular colors when the sun hit the horizon. In present day, she says that's perhaps her only sin. He asks why shes suggesting children are sinful; she corrects him, she is not claiming children are, only her. He says he doesn't see sin anywhere in her story but hes not religious; she says its because he doesn't know the rest of the story and shes not religious either. He asks why she would take the most unsympathetic aspect of religion, the concept of sin, and let it survive beyond religion.She continues the story. As a young girl (10 years old), the girl casually looks up body parts in an anatomy book while her father (Christian Slater) observes. The two go out on a walk. He tells her a story about how the ash tree made all the other trees in the forest jealous because it was so beautiful and flawless; but in the winter, when it lost all of its leaves, the other trees noticed the ash trees black buds and started laughing, saying Look, the ash tree has had its fingers in the ashes. She loves hearing his stories so much, she sometimes pretends she has forgotten them so he will tell them again.In present day, the man explains the fly on the wall is called a nymph and is the early stage of an insect. She explains that, as a young nymph, it was imperative of her to get rid of her virginity. She knew a boy at 15 who had a moped, so therefore she considered him sophisticated. She visits him; (it is revealed to be a young Shia LaBeouf). She asks him point blank to take her virginity. He agrees. Beforehand, he works on his moped and realizes its not working. He requests she takes off her knickers and then he humps her three times. We see a graphic counting to the number 3. She is then turned over and he humps her 5 times in the ass (we see 3 + 1, then + 2, + 3, + 4, + 5, so a graphic remains on the screen 3 + 5). They both put their clothes back on. He struggles to get his moped to work again; she makes one quick adjustment and it starts up right away. She has to waddle home, explaining she never forgot those two humiliating numbers 3+5.In present day, the man points out that those are Fibonacci numbers. She says it hurt so bad, she swore shed never sleep with anyone again but that didn't last long. A couple of years later, the teenaged girl, who now calls herself Joe (Stacy Martin), is with her friend B (Sophie Kennedy Clark) and they break open B's brothers piggy bank and put on clothes called fuck me now clothes. This is interspersed with shots of the fly (bait). They go on a train trip without buying tickets; the one who fucks the most men by the time they reach the destination will win a bag of chocolate sweets.The two walk past all the compartments, eyeing all the men. In present day, the man says they were reading the river. Most of the large fish stay sheltered from the current to save energy and to hide from the prey. Where the fish hides entails a very complicated hierarchy. The topography decides where the most attractive hiding spots are and the biggest fish choose the best positions.B tells Joe to ask a lot of Wh-- questions to engage the men in conversation. Joe goes into the first compartment. A family with a man, woman, and boy are on one side; a man beside her. She asks her first Wh-questions; What time is it? The father tells her. B walks by with her first conquest. Joe continues, Where do you come from? The son responds, From home. Who knows where the lavatory is? The father points out that there are lavatories in both directions. The man besides Joe tells her hell show her where the lavatory is. A shot of a fly-fisherman reeling in a fish. The man and her have sex in the bathroom.Joe explains that it was shockingly easy. Eventually, B is ahead, 5 to 3. All they had to do was look them in the eye and smile. But suddenly, the conquests stopped. The man explains that it happens in fishing, too either none of the fish are feeding or they're all feeding at the same time. They go into feeding frenzy. Fish most rarely bite at the beginning of a light rain because they feel safe when they swim in the stream because they cant be seen from above.Joe explains then it started again a bit more slowly. The man says, yes, fly-fishing can be done in several stages. And if the fish stop biting, you move on to phase two. You not only imitate an insect but an insect in trouble; you pull the line irregularly so the fish thinks its dealing with an easy prey. And then let the fly drift down the river and then halfheartedly make a few jumps.Joe goes into a compartment. She pretends to be upset; she explains that Betsy is very ill. The two men ask who Betsy is and she says her dwarf hamster. In real time, Joe explains that she did have a dwarf hamster as a child but never liked it. One man is more sympathetic than the other. He takes her hand. She asks him to show him the lavatory. The man has sex with her while she looks on, uninterested.B and Joe were running out of subjects and B is ahead on points. They go to a first class compartment. A train conductor asks for tickets. Joe checks her purse and tells him she thinks she lost hers. B says she hasn't bought a ticket for the shitty train and its too slow. He gives them a ticket that would require £8 (pounds) but B tears it up, along with a second one he issues. The man in the compartment with them pays for their tickets. The conductor leaves. B says they'd like to be nice to him the way he has to them but he refuses her sexual advances.The scoreboard now reads 10 for B and 6 for Joe. B says shell give Joe five extra points if she can get the first class passenger in the lavatory. The fisherman compares this to resorting to using a red wobbler when a fly has failed to work.Joe asks the man why he brought a gift; he says it's for his wife. She points out he travels first class but has bought the gift from the station. He explains that they have been trying to have a child and it has to happen now or never. His wife just started ovulating and all signs point to maximum fertility being tonight. So he is rushing home in attempt to get her pregnant. Now Joe realizes why he didn't have sex with B and her. However, she still approaches him and tries to seduce him. He begs her to stop but she doesn't; she performs fellatio on him without permission and he orgasms in her mouth. She feels no remorse for forcing him to orgasm and at the train stop later, she happily eats from the bag of chocolates.The fisherman is impressed that oral sex because her angler. She asks why he isn't disgusted by her reprehensible actions. He says the only thing she's done is give people an experience to remember and releasing the married man from his load; if you keep the load too long, the sperm will die or degenerate. Maybe thanks to her, the man now has a child. She tells him she discovered her power as a woman and used it without any concern for others. He tells her, if we have wings, not why fly?The man leaves the room for more tea. When he comes back, she is asleep. She wakes up. They introduce each other her name is Joe and his name is Seligman, a name she calls fucking ridiculous. He tells her its Jewish and it means the happy one. She asks if he's happy. He says he supposes he is, even though hes a person who cuts the nails of the right hand first. He divides humanity into two groups people who cut the nails of the left hand first are more lighthearted and have a tendency to enjoy life more because they go for the easiest task and save the difficulties for later. She says she always cuts the nails on the left hand first and doesn't think there's a choice; go for the pleasure first and then after the left hand is done, the right hand becomes the easiest one left (as compared to something a chore, like he considered it). He says he had never thought of it that way.She notices rugelach (a Jewish cake) on a plate he brought for her and is intrigued by the fact that he is serving it with a cake fork. Joe says pastries shouldn't be eaten with a cake fork since its un-manly and feminine. She explains that she also knew someone who ate rugelach daily with a cake fork and she needs to tell him about Jerôme.CHAPTER TWO: JERÔMEAn older Joe is seen in a montage, having sex with several different men. One by one, she tells each of them that they had given her her first orgasm. She explains in voice-over that B and her had started a club called The Little Flock. A group of girls gather together and recite Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva while someone else plays an organ. In present day, Seligman tells her the music is almost Satanic, using a triton, the Devils Interval, which was banned from music in the Middle Ages. Joe says the Vacuum Cleaner invented it on the piano, explaining she got the nickname because she had a sort of vacuum cleaner in her cunt that could get an erection from flaccid penises. She says the club was about fucking and the right to be horny but was also rebellious; they weren't allowed to have boyfriends and couldn't have sex with the same guy more than once. They were fixated on combating the love-fixated society.A girl smashes a window with a display of hearts in the window. During a club meeting, B admits to having sex with the same guy three times and is reprimanded by Joe. B tries to justify her relationship but Joe chastises her for using the word relationship. B tells Joe she doesn't know everything about sex and whispers that the secret ingredient to sex is love. Joe is seen storming out.In present day, Joe says For me, love was just lust with jealousy added. She continues, For every 100 crimes committed in the name of love, only one is committed in the name of sex. Joe explains she then desired a serious education. Seligman chuckles he envisions Joe's form of education involving masturbating with a pointing stick at the front of a classroom, wearing pigtails and glasses, using the stick to point out Glasgow on a map and then continue to masturbate with it.Joe tried to study medicine like her father but it was hard for her to concentrate so she dropped out of medical school. She applies for a job as an assistant at a printing house but has not acquired any appropriate skills. The woman interviewing her is unimpressed when Joe admits she didn't think skills would be necessary for secretarial work. The woman says she will discuss the possibility of her being hired with her boss, Jerôme, but doubts she has any chance. When she comes back, she lets her know Jerôme has agreed to hire her.She starts work the next day. Jerôme is revealed to be an adult Shia LeBeouf (who she lost her virginity to). It takes her a second to remember him. He brags about his position in the office (author's note: in a horrible British accent, yikes) and asks if she's thought of him since they were together; she obviously hasn't. He explains that his uncle usually works in the private office they're in but he's been horribly sick so he is taking his place in the meantime. Jerôme takes Joe on a tour, first introducing her officially to the woman who she interviewed with, Liz.They ride in an old elevator lift. When Joe's back is turned, Jerôme stops the elevator. He tries to get promiscuous with her but she pushes him away. She says he's not her type so he finally goes back to the control panel and turns the elevator back on; but it doesn't move. They both have to escape by jumping through a panel near the top.In present day, Seligman asks why she didn't have sex with him and she says she doesn't know. He supposes she got fired but she says no, if he had fired her, he would have lost. Since she didn't have any specific work duties, Joe spends her time at work cleaning up Jerôme's office. When he gets in, he is upset with her. He has her go back outside with the breakfast she has made. She knocks on the door and after a short while, he allows her to come in with the breakfast. He asks her why there is no cake fork for his rugelach; she tells him she had felt it was inappropriate.In present day, Seligman admits this is feminine but argues that a cake fork is a practical tool, somewhere between a knife and a fork so you can hold the cake in one hand and cut it with the other. He says that the Bolsheviks in Russia, to separate the men from the boys, sent a boy inside a house before they burned it down, to make sure it had cake forks and the arson was justifiable. Joe points out this isn't true and Seligman laughs.Joe begins seducing several men in the office; she tells one man he needs to wash his hands (to lead him to the bathroom). Another, she flirts with. Shes then seen leaving the bathroom with a third man.Jerôme considers this a game of war. Sometimes, he takes Joe into town just so she can hold his coat. They argue over a parking spot she sees because he claims there isn't enough space between cars to parallel park. He makes an attempt to prove himself right, stopping midway due to lack of space. She talks him into letting them switch seats; she then parallel parks with ease in her first try.At night, Joe is alone in the office, in Jerôme's space. She then began to feel a change inside her, desiring to be one of Jerôme's things, picked up and put down again and again. She scalds herself for seeing him in this new light. Seligman responds, Love is blind, but she corrects him: Love distorts things. Or even worse, love is something you'd never ask for. The erotic is something she asked for, or even demanded from men, but idiotic love and all the dishonest that follows humiliated her. Erotic is about saying yes; love appeals to the lowest instincts wrapped up in lies. How do you say yes when you mean no, and vice versa. Seligman points out she is defending her personality instead of simply revealing it.In flashback, Joe takes up walking, the same path she used to walk on with her father. She passes the ash tree, a lady with a poodle, an old man on a bench, and ends up on a little bridge overlooking a pond. She cant free herself from her thoughts of Jerôme and during this time, she wont let the other men shes having sex with touch her body with their hands and eventually stops having sex. She finds out where Jerôme lives but never rings the doorbell. She writes a letter expressing her feelings but it takes a month to get the courage to deliver it; on that date, she finds Jerôme's uncle back at his desk. He asks her for the letter and says he will get it to Jerôme; he complains about how Jerôme is traveling, having just married Liz, the woman that hired Joe.In present day, Joe explains she was promptly fired from her job since she had no experience. Even though he'd disappeared, she tries to keep Jerôme in her thoughts when she masturbates on a train. She finds details in other passengers that reminds them of Jerôme the shoes of one, the hair of another, the hands of another. Then she pieces them together (shown as a puzzle piece) but admits that in the long run, she couldn't hold on to the details of them. Seligman points out that memory is ultimately remembering silhouettes and essentials which Joe doesn't consider a bad thing.A 10-year-old Joe is in the woods with her father, this time in winter, where the crookedness of the trees and branches stand out. He explains that the branches are crooked from having to carry all the leaves into the sunlight, one long struggle for survival. He calls the naked trunks the souls of the trees, a poetic thought that is rare for him since he prefers empirical sciences.Now that Jerôme is gone, Joe intensifies her hunt for men. She compares her cunt to a supermarket door that opens/closes on its own with an overtly sensitive sensor. She experiences many different cocks shown in a photo-montage, grouping them accordingly, including big black cocks and circumcised cocks. She tells Seligman that if they combined all the foreskin cut off over time, it would reach to Mars and back again.Joe sees a painting that reads Mrs. H (the other half of her name is concealed in darkness). This leads toCHAPTER THREE: MRS. HNow, in flashback, Joe has reached a sizable number of lovers and has trouble remembering who is who. She listens to her answering machine and takes notes; since it has become impossible to keep track of the individual relationships and how to converse with them, she invents a method to decide randomly. Using the list of callers, she rolls a dice and if it lands on one, she will be overly loving when she calls them back; if it lands on two, not quite as passionate, and so on to five, which is a complete rejection and six, which is to just ignore the call. She then calls everyone on the pad back and leaves messages rejecting them, being loving, etc. She realizes that this makes her completely unpredictable which drives the men wild. To balance this stress, she looks through the herbarium she's created (a book of plant pressings).Because she's dealing with a large amount of men, there are pieces in their personalities which are hard to circumvent. She asks one, she has labeled H, to leave before her next guest (another lover) will arrive. He refuses to leave so she tells him that he has to get out because she knows he will never leave his family for her sake. She adds that its not satisfying to her that she cant have him completely and so they cant see each other any longer. She pushes him out, obviously not attached to him, and then prepares for her next lover to arrive. Midway through her preparations, there is a knock on the door. H is back; he's left his wife and kids (three young boys) and has come back with a suitcase. In the hall, Joe hears H's wife and kids spying on her. The wife (Uma Thurman) apologizes for intruding and says she just wanted to make sure he got there safe now that he's made the big decision. She asks if the children can go inside.Mrs. H and the kids go into Joe's apartment; the woman is complimentary of the place. She tries to give H his car keys but he is adamant he doesn't want to keep the car. She demands it and then says shell take the bus home as will her children, who will get used to public transport. Joe notices one of the boys is holding a pillow; Mrs. H explains that he embroidered it himself and it is a present for his dad. Mrs. H asks if it's okay if they call H Daddy here or maybe him or the man. She originally didn't want H to see the children anymore but figured its right for her (former) husband to be confronted with the little people whose lives hes destroyed. Mrs. H continues on, passive-aggressively. She asks if the children can see the whoring bed. She takes the kids to see Daddy's favorite place and leads them into the bedroom where they all stare at Joe's bed. She tells the kids they should memorize the bed so they can recall it years later, in therapy. She then says shes being silly and suggests they all have a cup of tea. She tells Joe that the children's father likes two lumps of sugar in his tea.Joe's next lover arrives. Mrs. H takes the flowers he is holding and then introduces all of her kids to the new suitor. Mrs. H admires the ménage à trois (assuming the new lover already knows Mr. H) and admits to failing to be as broad-minded. She tells her kids that they should ask all the questions their hearts desire and hopes that they never find themselves in such a situation again. None of the kids have anything to say. Mrs. H starts instead, asking how many lives Joe is able to destroy in one day five, 50, or several hundreds. Joe explains this is a big misunderstanding; she tells the kids she doesn't love their father. Mrs. H says shes just saying that to make them feel better because if this was a joke, it would be a joke so cruel and nobody can be that cruel to destroy a mesh of feelings woven over 20 years. She then tells the kids they should get away before things get too grotesque. One of her kids runs back to hug his dad and she pulls him away, saying she wouldn't want to give his father a guilty conscience. Mrs. H then begins screaming, goes back and slaps her husband, and then exits the building, screaming as she goes.Seligman asks how this episode affected Joe's life and she says, not at all and you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. He tells her some people blame the addict and others feel sorry for the addict; she explains that she was an addict out of lust and not out of need. For her, nymphomaniac was callousness. He asks how she felt during all this; she explains that sex was her constant companion yet she still felt alone.Flashback to Joe at age seven, having to have an operation with anesthesia. She is in the hospital hallway while the doctors prepare for the operation, and when she looks into the room, she feels as if she had to pass through an impenetrable gate all by herself. It wasn't because she missed her mom or dad but was as if she was completely alone in the universe; as if her whole body was filled with loneliness and tears.Seligman asks if hes not allowed to feel sorry for her. She responds by saying, Shall we go on? She sees he is reading a book which he explains is from the works of Edgar Allan Poe. He tells her he died in the worst imaginable way, in something called delirium tremors, which occurs when a long term use of alcohol is followed by a sudden abstinence, forcing your body into hypersensitive shock. This leads to horrifying hallucinations of rats and snakes and cockroaches coming out of the floor and worms slithering in the walls. The entire nervous system is on high alert and you have a constant panic and paranoia and then the circulatory system fails; but the panic and horror remains until the moment of death. Joe admits she knows what delirium is.CHAPTER FOUR: DELIRIUMIn flashback, an adult Joe walks alone in the courtyard of a hospital (filmed in black and white). She enters the hospital room of her sleeping father (still played by Christian Slater). He wakes up and she tells him that her mother is not coming; he defends her, saying she fears hospitals. Joe calls her a cowardly, stupid bitch but her father continues to defend her.Joe asks him if he's afraid but he says no; as a doctor, hes seen many die and does not fear death. He recites a quote about death, When we are, death does not come; when death has come, we are not. He explains we know its going to happen and thus is not afraid.At night, Joe's dad awakes from sleep, screaming out loud. He begins to sob. She tries to comfort him but he is having hallucinations and doesn't respond. A nurse comes in later and tells Joe she will stay with her father if Joe wants to go on a walk. Joe does, walking in the same courtyard at the beginning of the sequence. She looks up at the trees. Joe returns to the room with leaves from the ash tree. She pretends to not remember the story of the ash tree in winter and so he tells her the story again. He then begins having another attack of delirium. The doctors struggle to subside him and force him into a straightjacket while Joe backs away, crying. She is led out of the room by a doctor.A sullen Joe wanders the hospital. She finds an orderly working downstairs. Cut to her having sex with him, desperately trying to fill a void.Later, she is asleep on a chair in her dad's room. She wakes up and sees feces running down the side of his hospital bed. She tells someone outside and two nurses and a janitor begin to clean up. Joe's father has soiled himself while in the straightjacket; as they clean up, they make sure he is still tied down. He stares up at Joe with a wild look in his eyes, as if he is completely gone. She watches the nurse wipe her helpless dad.Cut to Joe having sex with someone else in the hospital. It fails to comfort her and she ends up sobbing afterwards, eventually falling asleep.Joe's father is now deceased, with a rose placed on his chest. Joe says after his death, she had no feelings left and felt shameful. Her mother is in the room, too, but she quickly leaves; Joe is left alone with her father. She goes on to explain that the shame she felt was, in seeing her dead father, she lubricated.Seligman tells Joe that he knows she wants to present herself in a certain way and has a dark bias that shes worse than anyone else but this story doesn't add to the belief. He tells her its extremely common to react sexually in a crisis; it may be shameful to her but in literature, there are many worse examples. She seems appreciative of him saying this but doesn't respond verbally.He cleans her plate and when he returns, she acknowledges his cassette player. She asks him to play what is in the machine. He tells her its Bach from his organ book. He was the master of polyphony, a European phenomenon from the Middle Ages that distinguishes that every voice is its own melody but together, in harmony. (In other words, two or more independent melodies are sung/played simultaneously, as opposed to a monophony, which is just one voice). Bach wrote many words for several choirs at the same time, wallowing in polyphony. This affects the melodic expression and the harmony, also mixed up with some rather incomprehensible mystique regarding numbers, most likely based on the Fibonacci sequence it starts with 0, 1 then adds the two numbers together so its 0+1 = 1, 1+1 = 2, 2+1 = 3, 2+ 3 = 5, etc. It is all about finding out a divine methodology in art and architecture, a bit like the way triton (played on the organ in B and Joe's club) is supposed to be a Satanic interval. The sum of the number values for Bach's name (B=2, A=1, C=3, H=8) equals 14, a number Bach used a lot of in his compositions. All the numbers are also Fibonecci numbers. The piece Seligman played has three voices Bach's voice, played with the pedal on the organ, a second voice played with the left hand, and a third voice played with the right hand a cantus firmus. Together, these three voices create the polyphony.Joe explains that normally nymphomaniacs are seen as people who cant get enough and therefore have sex with many different people; but if shes being honest, she sees it precisely as the sum of different sexual experiences. So in that way, she has only one lover.CHAPTER FIVE: THE LITTLE ORGAN SCHOOLSince the music has three voices, Joe limits herself to talking about three lovers. The bass is easy, a man she codifies as F. He has a used red car. As shes having sex with seven or eight men at this time, scheduling was tricky and they all had to have precise appointments. F always got there an hour early, with flowers, and waited patiently in his car for an hour. If she was having sex against the window and sees him, it always made her smile. Sometimes, she would let him come in and drink coffee while she finished with her previous lover. She appreciated that not only did he know what she wanted during sex, there was kind of a telepathy going on between them without saying anything, he knew what she wanted and where she wanted to be touched. His most sacred goal was her orgasm and she gave him privileges none of the others received; such as allowing him to give her a sponge bath. F was the bass voice monotone, predictable, and ritualistic but also the foundation that is so important, even if on its own, it doesn't mean much.We see 1/3 of the screen (the far left) as a shot of the red car and F's sexual encounters with Joe intercut with Seligman's foot on the organ pedal and the organ pipes, demonstrating that he is the first voice.A knock on the door. We now meet G, the only one of her lovers she had to and wanted to wait for. When he finally shows up, he doesn't immediately enter, the way a cat doesn't when you let it in as if once the door is open, it has all the time in the world. But she considers him more of a jaguar or a leopard, pointing out that he moved the same way as one (we see a naked G walking intercut with a leopard walking). They have sex; he is aggressive and in charge. On 1/3 of the screen (the far right), we see a jaguar devouring its prey, then intercut with a naked G walking, then Seligman's left hand playing the organ. The far left 1/3 of the screen then shows the F montage again; meanwhile, we hear both musical notes simultaneously. There is a black 1/3 between the two, demonstrating that there is a missing third piece of the polyphony.Joe explains that despite her success in managing the complicated logistics of arranging up to ten daily sexual satisfactions while also having a full-time job, Joe was still praying to a certain sadness so she would try to squeeze in walks when she could. We see her go on the same walk wed seen earlier past the ash tree, a woman with a poodle, a man on a bench. This is repeated again and again, at different speeds. She correlates this with the movements of a caged animal, as we see a lion pacing in a small cage; basically, we are all waiting for permission to die.During her latest walk, Joe finds fragments scattered around on the path. She begins to pick them up and discovers they are torn up photographs. When she pieces them together, its revealed to be shots of Jerôme.Suddenly, a hand reaches out to grab hers. On top of the bridge overlooking the pond is Jerôme. In present day, Seligman says there are completely unrealistic coincidences in her story; first that he hires her as a secretary by chance and then she takes a walk in a forest that is littered with photos of him and that hes present and pulls her up to her feet.She explains that Jerôme was there because he'd just had a fight with his wife, who was angry and tore up the photographs from their travels. Joe tells Seligman he'll get more out of the story by believing it than by not believing it; he admits this is true. Cut back to B whispering to Joe that the secret ingredient to sex is love.In present day, Joe admits that this ended up being the third voice of the secret ingredient. Seligman agrees that she has created a cantus firmus.Jerôme and Joe have sex...... graphically, in a several minute long sequence.She tells him (voiced in present day but synched in flashback), Fill all my holes.We now hear the melody again, with all three parts a three-way split screen showing lovers F, Jerôme, and G, along with shots of the musical equivalents on the organ (foot, left hand, right hand). The montage ends with shots of them all having sex with Joe before cutting to Seligman's tape player cutting off and the music stopping.Back to the sex scene with Jerôme and Joe. She zones out and he asks her what's wrong. She explains that she can't feel anything. She repeats: I can't feel anything over and over, eventually breaking down crying as the film cuts to black.To be continued..........Scenes from upcoming Nymphomaniac: Vol. II are shown during the end credits.

title: Bambi
synopsis: 1. A miracle in the woodsIn the depth of the forest, dawn was breaking. Trees grew so thickly here, that the morning first rays of sunlight could hardly break trough. The air was still and blue with mist. The faint, silvery sound of a distant waterfall was the only noise to be heard.A few drowsy birds were just beginning to greet the new day as a huge old owl swooped silently towards the hollow tree where he made his home. The world was waking up all around him. A little wood-mouse slipped out of her nest to wash her face in a dewdrop. Three baby sparrows cheeped shrilly as their mother brought them their first meal of the day: A cluster of berries. And with every second, the pale sunbeams grew brighter.The young rabbit Thumper, who was always the first of his family to arise, was waking up slowly, yawning and scratching as he did every morning.
But the owl was ready for bed. With a sigh he alighted on a branch, waddled into his hole, and fluffed up his feathers. His drowsy eyes dipped shut, and he fall asleep.
He didn't get to stay asleep very long.
A bluebird darted trough the air to perch on the tree next to the owl's. He twittered, and flew off.
From every corner, animals popped out of their hiding places and raced after her. Mrs. Quail moved swiftly along the forest floor, her babies trailing after her as if they were on a string.Thumper's sisters burst out of their house, tumbling over each other and their brother in their anxiety to get to the thicket first. Thumper dashed to the foot of the owl's tree and began drumming frantically on the ground with his right foot. Wake up! Wake up! he hollered at the top of his lungs.The owl shook himself irritably and squinted down at Thumper. Oh, what now? he groaned.Wake up, Friend Owl! the little rabbit persisted.Why? What's going on around here, anyway?It's happened! The new prince is born! shouted Thumper. We're going to see him! Come on, you'd better hurry up! And he dashed into the underbrush after his sisters. The new prince! The owl gave his feathers a hasty preening and soared into the air.The prince was a tiny fawn, only two hours old. When the animals reached the thicket where he had been born, he was curled up, sound asleep, next to his mother's warm side.
He didn't even stir as the creatures of the forest gathered into a circle around him.
Oh, my! said Mrs. Raccoon with a wistful sigh. Isn't he just the most-Oh, my! Beautiful! echoed hushed maternal voices from all around the circle.
Yes, indeed, said the owl from a bough overhead. This is, em, quite an occasion. Yes, sir. It isn't every day a prince is born.He bent low in a courtly bow to the fawn's mother. You are to be congratulated.
Thank you, said the prince's mother quietly. She leaned over and gave her baby a loving nudge. Wake up, she whispered. Come on, dear. We have company.Slowly, slowly the tiny fawn's head lifted. He stared wonderingly at the creatures standing in front of him.Hello, Prince! squeaked a mouse timidly. At once a chorus of greetings sprang up, and the owl let out a loud hoo-hoo so loud that the fawn turned away and burrowed his face into his mother's side. Then he gathered up his courage and peeked out again. And this time he managed a shy smile.Look! called Thumper excitedly. He's trying to get up!He was, but it wasn't working very well.
Try as he might, the fawn couldn't get his slender legs to work together.
He's kinda wobbly, isn't he? noted Thumper.Thumper! gasped Mrs. Rabbit. She gave a flustered smile at the fawn's mother.
Thumper scowled. But he is, he muttered, kicking at the ground in embarrassment. Aren't you? he asked the fawn.
The fawn nodded eagerly. He hadn't understood a word.
The owl chuckled. Looks to me like he's getting kind of sleepy, he said. I think it's time we all left.There was a murmur of protest from the younger animals. But the owl leaned over and fixed such a schoolmasterish glare on the crowd that they began to melt into the woods without another word.
Only Thumper still lingered in the thicket.
Whatcha gonna call him? he asked the fawn's mother when everyone else had left.She smiled at him. Well, I think I'll call him Bambi, she answered.
Thumper frowned thoughtfully, as if the choice were up to him. Bambi, he repeated, trying it out.Bambi. Yup, I guess that'll do all right. And he hopped off to find his family.
Bambi's mother glanced down at her baby, who was sound asleep again.Bambi, she murmured tenderly. My little Bambi.As the mother and child settled down together, high on the hill above the thicket the Great Prince of the Forest kept watch.2. Exploring the forestWalking already, well, what do you know? commented the gray squirrel as Bambi and his mother strolled through the forest. Bambi was three days old now. As far as he was concerned, he was the best walker the forest had ever seen, though sometimes his legs did get tangled. And he was proud that so many of the forest creatures had gotten the chance to see him.He had met Mrs. Quail and her babies scurrying through the underbrush as though they were late for an appointment. He had met Mrs. Possum and her babies, all hanging jauntily upside down from a tree branch. He had met Mr. Mole, who had popped up right under Bambi's nose. Good mornin', Mr. Mole had said politely. Nice, sunny day. He had squinted up at the bright sky, winced a little, and returned with relief to his tunneling. The curious little fawn tried to follow the mole's path, but wound up tumbling over some reeds as his mother and the rabbit family looked on.He doesn't walk very well, does he? asked Thumper with interest.Thumper! scolded his mother. What did your father tell you this morning?Thumper sighed. If you can't say somethin' nice... Don't say nothin' at all,' he muttered, frowning down at the ground.Bambi's mother leaned over and nuzzled Bambi's shoulder a little. Come on, Bambi, she urged gently. Get up. Try again.
Come on! Come on! squealed Thumper and his sisters excitedly. Get up! Get up! You can do it!And after he'd managed to sort his legs out, Bambi pranced happily off after his new friends.
But, trying to follow the little rabbits, the young deer had difficulties with a large log lying across the path.C'mon, you can do it, encouraged Thumper.Hop over it. Like this. All the bunnies chimed in as they leapt back and forth over the log, Hop over it! Hop over it!Bambi stepped back to gather momentum, but his hop landed him smack-dab on top of the log.You didn't hop far enough, said Thumper wisely.Bambi finally got all of himself over the log, but in the process his legs became tangled once more, causing the bunnies all to scatter just in case he might fall on them.3. Learning to speakAlong the path, Bambi and his companions came upon a flock of delighted finches who had discovered a bush full of delicious wild berries.Bambi looked inquiringly at Thumper.Those are birds, Thumper told him.B-burr? Bambi repeated.He hadn't had the faintest idea that the word was going to pop out of him, and neither had the rabbits. Hey! He talked! yelled Thumper. He's trying to say 'bird'!Burr! Bambi said again.Huh-uh. Thumper never missed the chance to be instructive. He clambered up onto a rock and looked Bambi in the eye. Say Bir-d; he ordered.Burr, Bambi said.'Bir-duh! insisted Thumper.This conversation had taken the finches' attention off the berries. Now they got into the act, too. Say bird! they peeped excitedly, darting around and around Bambi's head. Say bird! Saybirdsaybirdsaybirdsaybird!BIRD!shouted Bambi-so loudly that the little rabbits and finches were scattered helter-skelter. Bird! he repeated in delight.
Thumper's sisters ran back to tell their mother the news. He talked! He talked, Mama; the young prince said 'bird.'Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, sang Bambi happily.Just then another flying creature fluttered slowly toward Bambi and perched on the fawn's tail.
Bambi twisted around to stare at it. Bird! he exclaimed happily. It's not a bird, Thumper corrected him. It's a butterfly.B-butterfly? Bambi turned around to see the butterfly again. Now it, too, was gone.But over by the rocks the ground seemed to be covered with butterflies!
He raced over to them. Butterfly! Butterfly! he caroled joyfully.No, they're flowers! Pretty flowers! See? Thumper buried his nose in a bunch of yellow petals and sniffed appreciatively. Pretty fl . . . Bambi's voice trailed off as he, too, began to sniff the flowers. When he raised his head, he was nose-to-nose with a baby skunk.Flower! said Bambi proudly.M-me? The skunk's eyes widened.He was interrupted by peals of laughter.No, no, no, no, no! gurgled Thumper, rolling around and pounding the ground deliriously. That's not a flower! He's just a little...Oh, that's all right! the baby skunk interrupted hastily. He beamed shyly up at Bambi.He can call me a flower if he wants to. I don't mind.Pretty! Bambi piped again. Pretty flower!From the look of pure, grateful devotion the baby skunk gave him, it was clear that Bambi had made a friend for life.4. The thunderstormBambi and Thumper were making their way back to their mothers when a huge crack of thunder sounded directly overhead. Startled, Bambi turned to Thumper. Was this some kind of new game, too? But for once Thumper was looking a little uncertain. I... I think I'd better go home now, he said uneasily, and vanished into the underbrush.CRACK! came the thunder again, and a bolt of lightning sizzled in the sky. Bambi dashed, terrified, after his mother as the first raindrops began to fall.Back at the thicket, Bambi and his mother lay down, listening to the sound of the rain. Bambi yawned, ready for sleep, but just couldn't take his eyes off the falling raindrops.The wood mouse scurried along toward her home, stopping under toadstools whenever she could. A mother robin landed on her nest and quickly covered her three drenched fledglings with her wings.
It was dark now, but flashes of lightning kept illuminating the forest with eerie clarity.Thumper and the other rabbits huddled together under the roots of a tree and stared out fearfully at the storm. High up in his hollow tree, the owl grumbled a little and turned his back on the weather.
And as the storm passed, Bambi fell asleep beside his mother.5. On the meadowMother, what are we going to do today? asked Bambi as he followed her through the forest. It was still so early that he could barely see her through the mist. I'm going to take you to the meadow, his mother replied.Bambi paused to sniff curiously along the way, then scampered after his mother again. Meadow? What's the meadow? he asked.It's a very wonderful place, his mother told him.Then why haven't we been there before? asked Bambi.You weren't big enough, his mother replied. They were coming up to a shallow stream now, and she showed him where to cross. The instant they were across, Bambi began chattering away again.Mother, you know what? Thumper told me we're not the only deer in the forest!Well, he's right, said his mother. There are many deer in the forest besides us.Then why don't I ever see them? asked the little fawn plaintively.You will, sometime. Bambi was excited. Today? On the meadow?Perhaps, his mother told him. Hush, now. We're almost there. And she led him up over a little hill.Bambi had never seen anything like the sight that greeted him on the other side. Stretching out in front of him was what looked like a whole world's worth of long, golden-green grass studded with wildflowers. On one side of the meadow a marshy pond so unlike the rushing streams Bambi knew from the forest was reflecting the peach-colored light in the dawn sky. And the sky! Before this, Bambi had only caught glimpses of the sky through the trees. Out here, why, it's bigger than everything! he marveled. And I never knew the sun was as big as that, or as round!
The meadow! he cried exultingly, and raced down the slope toward it.
No, Bambi! Wait! In his mother's voice was a note Bambi had never heard before. She streaked ahead of him, wheeled around, and planted herself in his path.You must never rush out on the meadow, she panted. There might be danger! Then, more gently: Out there, we are unprotected. The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us. So we have to be very careful. Wait here.Chastened, Bambi shrank back into the underbrush.I'll go out first, his mother continued. And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.Only Bambi's frightened brown eyes could be seen as he huddled down in the brush and stared at his mother. Slowly and carefully, she stepped out onto the meadow and gazed across its expanse. Then she looked back at her son. Come on, Bambi, she called. It's all right.Bambi crept timidly out toward her. His heart was pounding. Come on! his mother called. He walked hesitantly in her direction, then began to leap more courageously when suddenly she bounded away.
Startled, Bambi froze in his tracks, and then he realized that she was playing. He burst into laughter and dashed after her.
There was so much room for running on the meadow, and so much to look at! Butterflies brighter than any Bambi had seen in the forest floated leisurely above the flowers. In the sky birds soared and dove for the sheer fun of it, and in the grass Bambi found the rabbits nibbling clover.Bambi took a mouthful but was interrupted by Thumper. No, no, not that green stuff. Just eat the blossoms - that's the good stuff. Thumper!! his mother called sternly. What did your father tell you?
About what?About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens, reminded his mother.Oh, that one. Thumper cleared his throat.  'Eating greens is a special treat... It makes long ears . . . And great big feet.' But it sure is awful stuff to eat! he added so just Bambi could hear. I made that last part up myself.Bambi had chased a frog to the pond's edge when he noticed something strange. He had two reflections in the water. Hmmm. Maybe that's just the way things happen on the meadow, he thought as he bent closer to the pond's surface. To his surprise, only one of the reflections moved. The other stayed still, staring mischievously at him.Slowly Bambi lifted his head. There, standing next to him, was another fawn. A long-lashed, delicate-looking fawn who giggled when their eyes met.She giggled again and stepped toward him. Bambi scrambled backwards hastily. Then, as the other fawn took another step in his direction, he turned and dashed back toward the spot where he'd last seen his mother.To his surprise, she was standing next to another doe. Bambi, this is your aunt Ena, she said as Bambi rushed toward her. And that's little Faline.But Bambi didn't want anything to do with little Faline. Wide-eyed and timid, he drew back behind his mother and peeked out from around one of her legs.
For a third time, Faline giggled. He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama? she asked merrily.Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello, her mother replied.Hello, Bambi, Faline said boldly. Bambi retreated even farther behind his mother. I said, hello!Aren't you going to answer her? asked Bambi's mother.Scowling, he shook his head.You're not afraid, are you? asked his mother, and he shook his head again. Well, then, go ahead! And she pushed him with her nose. Go on, say hello, she told him firmly, in a motherly, no-nonsense voice. Bambi cleared his throat. He pawed the ground a little. Then he glowered up at Faline.H'lo, he croaked.That was all it took. The silly young Faline giggled and danced around Bambi, who was so shy and confused by her that he fell into a small pond.
Faline darted in and out of the pond's cattails, giving Bambi little kisses on his cheeks. Finally, forgetting his shyness, Bambi gave a surprising whoop and charged after her.6. The Great Prince of the ForestBambi and Faline were playing tag when they heard a low, thudding sound. They paused. Could this be another thunderstorm? No. Streaking out of the woods were more deer. Dozens of huge deer, bigger than Bambi could have dreamed. The thudding sound was the noise of their hoofs.Bambi stared at the bucks with awe. They were plunging back and forth across the meadow, leaping fearlessly off the highest boulders and grappling in play-combat. He could hardly believe he would ever grow into something so magnificent. Bambi began to show off with his own imitation of their leaps.Then, as he watched, the bucks grew still. As one, they turned to face the woods. They had all sensed someone coming. It was a mighty stag, far bigger than the rest, with massive antlers fully a yard across.
And something about the grave, unhurried way the stag moved toward the meadow told Bambi without any words that he was in the presence of majesty.Slowly, proudly, the stag advanced and walked up to the group of bucks without seeming to notice them. He was about to pass on by when instead he turned his great head and stared down at little Bambi in silence. Bambi stared back, frozen with awe. Then he smiled hesitantly at the huge stag.Not a flicker of expression crossed the stag's face. Only his ears twitched a little, as if he were surprised at Bambi's daring.
Bambi's smile faded away, and he felt himself growing shy again without knowing why.The stag continued his slow, stately procession through the meadow and did not look back.Suddenly Bambi became aware that his mother had walked up behind him. Mother, he stopped and looked at me, he whispered.Yes, I know.Mother, why was everyone still when he came onto the meadow?Everyone respects him, his mother explained softly. For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long. He's very brave and very wise. That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest.She turned to watch the stag as he walked away. The old stag looked down on the meadow from a high ledge. He moved deeper into the forest, then halted, sensing something was wrong. Suddenly he turned and raced back through the forest and onto the meadow. Bambi saw the Great Prince charging back toward the other deer as if to warn them. Above him, a flock of crows was screaming crazily in the sky. Before Bambi could ask what was the matter, the other deer were crashing past him, running toward the forest. Faline! Bambi heard Ena scream, and Faline raced up to her mother's side. The two of them dashed out of sight. A panic-stricken pheasant whirred up into the air directly in front of Bambi. All about him were the thundering of deer hoofs and the screams of terrified birds.The little fawn stood stock-still in the grass watching bewilderedly as the other deer hurtled past him. Bambi! he heard his mother calling from far away, but so many creatures were blocking his view that he couldn't see her.Mother! he called desperately. Mother, where are you?No answer.Mother! Bambi screamed.Then, without any warning, the great Prince was at his side. Together they raced toward the edge of the forest, where Bambi's mother caught up to them. The three deer dashed to safety just as a shattering explosion rang through the air. Then the only sounds on the meadow were the echo of the shot and the crows' screams...It was sunset before Bambi's mother felt it was safe to come out of hiding. Come on out, Bambi, she said gently.Bambi didn't budge from his spot deep inside the thicket.Come on, she urged. It's safe now. We don't have to hide any longer.
Bambi poked his head out cautiously. When he saw that all was still, he pulled himself out of the thicket little by little and walked, trembling, up to his mother.What happened, Mother? Why did we all run? he asked in a shaky voice.After a long pause she said quietly, Man... was in the forest.Suddenly the air seemed very cold.7. Skating on iceTo Bambi, each golden summer day was like the ones that had come before. Autumn crept in so gradually that year that he hardly noticed the trees changing colors until they began to lose their leaves.
First one scarlet maple leaf tore itself loose, then a handful of yellow oak leaves - and then it seemed to Bambi that the whole forest was filled with scraps of color dancing in the wind.
Bambi was sure that the last two leaves on the oak tree just outside his thicket meant to stay put forever. Each morning he ran to see whether they were still there, and each morning they were still fluttering bravely on their branch. One day, though, Bambi glanced up to see the smaller of the two leaves shuddering in the breeze. With a sound like a sigh, it broke loose and floated gently to the ground.
Only a few seconds later its companion drifted down to lie beside it.
The next morning Bambi woke up early, with a sense that something had changed in the night. The air was frosty and cold, and the thicket was filled with a strange bluish-white light. He went to the thicket's opening to explore, and gasped.Mother, look! he cried. What's all that white stuff?His mother lifted her head. Why, it's snow! she said in surprise.Snow? asked Bambi, staring at the brand new forest.Yes, his mother told him. Winter has come.Bambi took a cautious step into the white drift outside the thicket- Look. Footprints! he said in delight. Just then, Thumper called from a nearby snow-covered hill.Hi ya, Bambi! Watch what I can do. Yippee! He ran down the hill, leaped out onto the water, which was no longer water but ice, and slid far out on the pond. C'mon, it's all right. Look, the water's stiff.
But when Bambi took a mighty leap from the same hill, his Yippee abruptly ended in an Ooof and he wound up on his belly. Thumper called out to him, Some fun, huh, Bambi?Bambi responded with a very weak smile. Try as he might, he could not stand on the slippery surface, and his attempts gave Thumper a bad case of the giggles. Through his laughter Thumper managed to say, No, no' Ya gotta watch both ends at the same time. He decided it was time for him to take charge.First Thumper pushed one of Bambi's legs up and then another, then another and another until Bambi stood shakily. But Bambi's legs would not stay put and down he went again. This time his legs got all tied up.
I guess you'd better unwind it, Thumper volunteered.Again Thumper got all of Bambi's legs in position, and giving him a good push, together they slid across the ice. For a moment, Thumper's plan seemed to be working, but not for long. Smack! They slid into the biggest snowbank.As Thumper's head popped up out of the snow, he heard a tiny whistling noise coming from a burrow in the side of a hill. Curious, they headed over to see what it was and found Flower, the skunk, lying on his back in a nest of leaves, sound asleep and snoring.Wake up, wake up! said Thumper.Flower opened a drowsy eye. Is it spring yet? he murmured dreamily.No! said Bambi incredulously. Winter's just starting!Mmmmm-hmmmmm, sighed Flower.Whatcha doin'? asked the curious Thumper. Hibernatin?Mmmmm-hmmmmm, said Flower again.Whatcha want to do that for?asked Bambi.Flower chuckled a little- All us flowers sleep in the winter, he said with a yawn. Well, g'night. . .He pulled his fluffy tail over himself like a quilt, snuggled down into the leaves, and went back to sleep.8. Death on the meadowAs the days grew shorter and the snow grew deeper, winter stopped being fun and became wearisome. Now it seemed to Bambi as though he were always limping along through the snowdrifts, always trying to catch up to the rest of the deer, always fighting the icy wind, always hungry and cold.The deer in the forest had banded together to look for food. For hours every day they struggled through the woods in search of the scraps of bark and twigs that were all the forest offered them now.
When Bambi's mother had first torn a piece of bark off a tree and gave it to him, he had been shocked at how dry and tasteless it was. And later even the bark grew scarce. Sometimes the two of them could only find enough for one. When that happened, his mother always went without.
Then came the day when they found no bark at all. In every direction, every tree they could see had been stripped higher than Bambi's mother could reach.Back in the thicket, Bambi curled up wearily next to his mother. Winter sure is long, isn't it? he said with a shiver.It seems long, but it won't last forever. His mother comforted him.
I'm awfully hungry, Mother, whispered Bambi. His mother kissed him. Yes, dear, I know, she said patiently.So the weeks passed by, lean and bitter, until one morning Bambi's mother called happily, Bambi, come here! They had wandered to the meadow that morning, and she was standing near the brook staring down at something in the snow.Bambi scampered over. There in the snow was a patch of green!
New spring grass, said his mother.
Bambi took an eager mouthful, and then another and another. The grass tasted of spring itself fresh, vibrant, leafy. It was a flavor he had almost forgotten after so many days of hard, dry bark. Bambi ate hungrily.Bambi's mother had barely started to eat when abruptly she stopped and lifted her head to sniff the air. She glanced from side to side as if she were trying to hear something.
Bambi, she whispered. But he was so busy eating that he didn't hear her.Bambi! she said in terror.Startled, Bambi looked up at her.The thicket! she cried, and the two of them sprang toward the forest.
Bambi had never run so fast. He vaulted over the stream without thinking about it and dashed across the snow. He could hear his mother pounding along just behind him, her breath coming hard. Faster! she called out. Faster, Bambi! A shot rang out.Horrified, Bambi glanced back over his shoulder at his mother. Keep running! Keep running! she cried hoarsely. Don't look back! Another shot echoed in the air just as he reached the edge of the woods. He leaped forward, darting through the trees, and with a final burst of energy, tore through the underbrush, down the last steps of the old, familiar path, and into the thicket. There he stopped, gasping for breath.
We ... we made it, Mother! he panted.We made it!There was no answer.Mother? Bambi faltered.Silence.Bambi walked to the entrance of the thicket and peeked out into the woods.There was no sign of his mother. Mother! Bambi cried again. Mother, where are you? A light snow was beginning to fait. Trembling, Bambi cautiously left the thicket. His mother was nowhere in sight.
Where could she be? He knew she was out there somewhere. Why didn't she answer?Mother!The forest had become dark and ominous. The trees seemed bigger and taller and less friendly. The snow was coming down harder now. Bambi tried to retrace his steps, but his tracks were already completely covered. In the muffled silence of the new snow, there was no sound other than his bewildered cries.He called again and again, Mother . . . Mother! Desperately Bambi searched for her, stumbling through the snowfall that was now so dense he could scarcely see where he was going. His heart was beating so hard that he could not think. He had never known fear like this before, or such loneliness.Mother, he wept, and his head bent low. His last cry froze in his throat and became a startled gasp.A huge, dark shape loomed above him. It was the old stag Bambi had once seen on the meadow. The Great Prince of the Forest. He was staring down at the little fawn, his face hidden in shadow.Your mother can't be with you anymore, he said quietly.Bambi gave one wild, beseeching glance up at the stag. Then, stricken, he bowed his head. A single tear rolled down his cheek and vanished into the snow.Come... my son, said the stag.He turned and walked back into the forest.Bambi looked once -only once- toward the spot where he had last seen his mother.Then, slowly, he began to follow the Great Prince and soon both disappeared in the upcoming blizzard...9. Twitterpated!Winter had come and gone once more and now once again the last patches of snow had melted reluctantly away. The plants in the forest, freed from winter's icy grasp, were springing joyously into life. Sun poured through the new leaves and splashed down onto the wildflowers. The trees were filled with blossoms and birds, the air with fragrance and birdsong. There wasn't a crevice or a cranny in the forest that spring had left untouched.Not that any of this pleased the old owl, who despised spring. He hated all the sunlight and the twittering and the way every tree he tried to take a nap in was filled with lovestruck birds.Same thing every spring, he grumbled.Tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet! Love's sweet song, huh? Pain in the pinfeathers, I call it... What's that? What's that? Oh, now what's going on?The sapling he was perched in had suddenly begun to vibrate as though an earthquake were shaking it. It flung the surprised owl right off his perch.
He landed with a feather-shaking thump on a branch below. Ouch! he yelled. Stop it! Get out of here! All of you! Crossly he peered down at the handsome, broad-shouldered young buck who had been polishing his antlers against the tree trunk. And you, too, he added, almost falling off his branch again.
At the sight of the owl, the young buck broke into a smile. Hello, Friend Owl! he called gaily. Don't you remember me?
Why. . . why . . . why, it's the young prince' gasped the owl, his frown vanishing completely.Bambi nodded.I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers, observed the owl, and Bambi lifted his head proudly. Very impressive. You know, just the other day I was wondering what had become of you.Hello, Bambi! called an eager voice, cutting short the owl's pleasantries. I thought that might be you'It was Thumper! But this Thumper was just as changed as Bambi himself. Gone were the baby roundness of his face and the fluffiness of his little body. He was trim, lean, and sleek now - the perfect specimen of a wild rabbit.As the two friends greeted each other, they heard another voice calling, Hi ya, fellas! They turned to see Flower waving at them from a patch of daisies. He, too, had grown up, but his smile was as sweet as ever. He was just as bashful as ever, too. When Bambi and Thumper turned toward him, he dropped his head shyly and began sniffing the daisies as though that was what he'd been meaning to do all along.
Just then a pair of meadowlarks flew playfully past Flower, zooming around his head almost making him dizzy. The birds chased each other around Bambi's new antlers and played tag over Thumper's head for just a moment before spinning gaily in circles and darting away again.
Well, what's the matter with them? Flower asked in amazement. Why are they acting that way?Don't you know? the owl asked them.The three friends shook their heads. They're twitterpated! the owl explained.Twitterpated? echoed Bambi.Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the springtime! said the owl. Bambi, Thumper, and Flower stared blankly at him, so he explained further.For example: You're walking along, minding your own business -looking neither to the left nor to the right- when all of a sudden, you run smack into a pretty face. Hoo-hoo!The owl's voice was dripping with sarcasm.You begin to get weak in the knees, he continued. Your head's in a whirl. And before you know it, you're walking on air!He glowered down at them. Knocks you for a loop, it does! And you completely lose your head . . . and it can happen to anybody, so you'd better be careful!He aimed a cranky wing at Bambi. It could happen to you. He pointed at Thumper. To you, too. He pointed at Flower - and hesitated. Yes, it could even happen to you, the owl decided after a second. So you'd all better watch out!Well, it's not going to happen to me, said Thumper firmly.Me neither, agreed Bambi.Me neither! said Flower with great force.And with that the three friends marched off into the forest, each of them utterly determined to resist the charms of spring.But, as Flower passed a blossoming bush, he thought he heard it giggle. He hesitated ... he peered into the bush ... he couldn't believe it, but... the bush was blinking back at him. He started to run after Bambi and Thumper, but the bush giggled again.
Then a pretty girl skunk came out of the bush and with a whirling dance gave the startled Flower a kiss.
Flower was completely twitterpated. He giggled, shrugged his shoulders, and went off happily through the field of daisies with his new girlfriend, Thumper and Bambi were shocked as they watched the two skunk tails disappear together in the distance.In the forest glade ahead, a lovely girl bunny was preening herself. When she saw Thumper approaching . . . well, it was love at first sight- She cleared her throat prettily to get Thumper's attention as he went by.
Thumper stopped in midstride and just stared at her with his mouth open.
She began humming a song, then fluttered her eyelashes, and said in a sultry, musical voice, Hello.
Thumper swallowed hard and said nothing; he was too twitterpated to respond at all.Bambi was appalled at Thumper's behavior and kept walking, leaving him behind under the girl bunny's magic spell. Bambi could hear her singing to Thumper in her soft, seductive voice, Lah, lah, lah, lah . . . and he could tell that Thumper loved every bit of it.
Bambi sighed as he walked slowly toward a stream to take a drink. Bambi bending his head to drink.Suddenly he choked on a mouthful of water. There, in the stream, was another reflection. He lifted his head slowly. Gazing at him with a faint smile on her face was a slender, graceful young doe.Hello, Bambi, she said. Don't you remember me?Bambi only stared at her, open-mouthed.I am Faline.Still smiling, Faline advanced across the stream toward him.
He took a hasty step backward and tripped over a rock in the stream. Splash! He collapsed in a gawky heap and stared up at Faline. Her smile didn't waver. She looked breathtakingly composed as she continued across the stream toward Bambi.Bambi gathered himself up and clambered backward up the bank of the stream. He might have gotten away, too, if his brand new antlers hadn't become tangled in the branch of an apple tree.Pink petals showered gently down as Bambi shook his head frantically, trying to free himself. But before he'd made any progress, Faline walked up to him, and kissed him on the cheek.Bambi caught his breath. He turned his head toward Faline and stared into her huge, dark eyes.The forest suddenly seemed to Bambi like a cloud-filled sky and he felt as though he could fly, Faline scampered across the stream, paused to look back at Bambi teasingly, then sprang up the bank. Bambi leaped after her, and the two of them bounded off through the forest.10. Fighting bucksSuddenly someone thrust himself between them. It was another buck. Ronno! He was bigger than Bambi and heavier. He scowled fiercely at Bambi and shook his antlers threateningly and began pushing Faline up the path into the forest.Bambi! cried a frightened Faline.Suddenly anger blazed through Bambi and burned his fear completely away. He began to paw the ground with his hoof. Ronno pawed the ground himself and thundered toward Bambi. They grappled antlers for only a second before Ronno flung the younger buck over his shoulder.Bambi! cried Faline in alarm.Bambi hit the ground with a bone-shaking thud. For a minute he lay there motionless, the wind knocked out of him. Then, as Ronno charged toward him again, he staggered to his feet and aimed his antlers at Ronno's chest.Again they grappled and again Ronno threw Bambi into the air.
Bambi pulled himself up painfully and stood on his hind legs as Ronno charged. This time the bucks fought with their front hoofs, slashing viciously at each other while a trembling Faline watched. At first she was sure Ronno was going to win the battle. But, little by little, the bigger buck began to tire. He had never before had to fight so long or so hard.He's starting to give up! Bambi exulted as he pushed Ronno backward yet again. They were fighting on the edge of a rain-filled gully now. Bambi gritted his teeth and hurled himself into the air, hitting Ronno with the whole of his weight.Ronno stumbled backward and lost his footing. With a furious shout he tumbled head over heels down the gully and into the water.
Ronno shook his head as if to clear it. Then he rose and gave Bambi a bewildered look. He shook his head again and stumbled away through the water.Faline tiptoed up to Bambi's side. She laid her head lovingly on his shoulder. And together they walked through the mists out onto the beauty of the meadow.11. Man returnsOne chilly gray autumn dawn, Bambi woke up with a start. Faline was still sleeping peacefully beside him in the thicket. None of the birds were awake yet, and except for a few falling leaves, the woods seemed still. Yet Bambi was sure there was something wrong. He stood up quietly, so as not to wake Faline, and stepped cautiously out of the thicket.The forest was silent and calm, but now Bambi knew what had awakened him. It was the smell of smoke.
Moving more quickly, he trotted up a narrow path that led to a cliff. From the cliff, he knew, there was a clear view of the valley.
And there below, a thin, curling line of smoke was rising from a campfire.
It is Man, came a deep, grave voice from behind Bambi. He turned and saw the old stag, the Great Prince of the Forest, standing beside him. As if in answer to the Great Prince's words, crows circling in the valley below began screaming raucously.He is here again, said the old stag.There are many this time. We must go deep into the forest. Come with me!Before Bambi could speak, the stag had wheeled around and dashed into the woods.Bambi took a tentative step after him and then stopped. Faline! he cried aloud. In the thicket, the sound of the crows had awakened Faline. She looked around nervously for Bambi. Where had he gone? She, too, sensed something in the air. She called frantically for Bambi several times and searched for him near the thicket.But there was no answer.With each passing moment she became more frightened. Finally she ran in panic through the woods.Bambi reached the thicket only seconds after Faline had left. He was beside himself with fear for his loved one, and he darted off in search of her.The crows were above the treetops now. Their harsh shrieks of warning were beginning to wake up the whole forest. Eyes glanced up uneasily, and a few nervous forest creatures began creeping deeper into the woods, hardly daring to peek over their shoulders to see what was happening.But everyone knew what was happening. The crows' screams of danger could mean only one thing. The meadow was hushed and fearful. Three pheasants trembled in their hiding place under the deep grass. He's coming, faltered the youngest of the three.Hush! Don't get excited! her older sister tried to soothe her.He's . . . he's coming closer! wailed the first pheasant, unheeding. We'd better fly!No! Don't fly! gasped the other two pheasants. Whatever you do, don't fly!The first pheasant was sobbing now. He's almost here! she wept, and her voice rose to a scream. I can't stand it any longer! Wings beating wildly, she threw herself into the air. There was a thunderous crack overhead, and her body fell from the sky.Instantly the shooting began in force. The animals hidden under the grass panicked at the sound. Terrified, they streaked across the meadow toward the forest. Birds flew shrieking into the sky - and dropped motionless out of it. The sound of gunshots came ever closer, and with it the crazed barking of the hunting dogs.Searching desperately for Bambi, Faline dashed up a rocky path. Suddenly, she turned and ran back in the other direction, chased by a large pack of snarling, barking dogs - Man's dogs.Faline ran and ran, the dogs biting at her heels. They seemed to be everywhere, and Fallne's only hope was to clamber up onto a high rocky ledge just out of their reach. Bambi! she cried frantically, Bambi!The dogs yapped and growled, all the while leaping up at her. In the distance, Bambi heard the ominous howling and barking of the dogs and above the noise, Faline's terrified voice. He followed his senses to the spot where the vicious dogs had Faline cornered and without a moment's hesitation, he plunged into battle. With lowered head and strong thrusts, Bambi flipped one of the dogs over his antlers, but the rest of the snarling mass instantly turned on him.Bambi retreated a few paces, but only to charge again. This time he used his hoofs too, kicking wildly as he stabbed with his antlers.
He reared up violently, shaking the dogs off, and then whirled around to attack again.Quick, Faline! Jump! he called.Faline leaped off the ledge and disappeared into the forest.Bambi continued to fight valiantly, until finally he saw his opportunity to break away. He dashed up the steep bank behind the rocky ledge. The dogs were so close behind him that Bambi could feel their breath on his heels. He pulled himself up the bank with every bit of strength he had. The pack of dogs would certainly have reached him and torn him apart, if the frantic pawing of his hoofs hadn't started a rockslide as he neared the top of the bank.Now Bambi could hear the dogs' agonized yelps as rocks and boulders pelted them. But he didn't slow down. Ahead of him was a gorge. On the other side, he would be safe...He gathered his strength and sailed out over the chasm.
A shot rang out and Bambi's body arched in agony. Then he hit the ground on the other side and sprawled there, unconscious...12. The wildfireDown in the valley, a passing breeze blew a handful of dry leaves onto the dying campfire. Soon a tiny flame sprang up and began licking at the grass. One second, it seemed, there was a forest. The next second, there was nothing but fire. The flames devoured everything they touched and, ravenous for more, rushed forward into the woods.
Trees that had stood for hundreds of years groaned as the fire consumed them. Blazing embers fell into the stream and set it boiling. And hundreds upon hundreds of desperate animals raced only inches ahead of the flickering demon that was so eager to catch them.Bambi knew nothing of this. He was lying in a haze of pain at the edge of the gorge. Dimly he was aware of the heat and smoke, the crackling of the flames and the animals' screams, but none of it mattered to him.
Then he heard a deep voice above him.Get up, Bambi.Bambi's eyes flickered, but he didn't move.You must get up, repeated the voice.This time Bambi raised his head and stared dully at the Great Prince standing over him. Bambi tried to rise, but fell to the ground.You must, said the stag sternly.Bambi didn't answer.Get up! The stag's voice was harsh now.Bambi managed to pull himself shakily onto his knees. He was staggering so badly that he pitched forward. Pain coursed through his body. He would have collapsed again if the old stag hadn't been there.And now, follow me, commanded the stag, and Bambi began stumbling along behind him.Then a sheet of fire raised itself up in front of the two deer. The scorching blast of heat cleared the pain from Bambi's head. Now he understood the danger they were in, He skidded along the gorge behind the stag, all thoughts of his injury forgotten.But everywhere the two deer turned, the mocking flames rose up in front of them. The Great prince wheeled around in the thick smoke and led Bambi to the stream. Huge tree trunks, glowing red, were toppling into the water all around them. Sizzling embers flew through the air like burning brands.This is the wrong direction! We're heading toward the waterfall! thought Bambi frantically. But looking backward, he realized they had no choice. Behind them was a solid wall of fire.The noise of the waterfall was drowning out even the sound of the flames. Bambi and the stag rushed ahead over the slippery rocks.
Now they came to the very edge of the waterfall. Thirty feet below them, water churned and boiled furiously above the treacherous rocks.
The two deer hesitated, but only for a second. Then they threw themselves over the edge and fell into the maelstrom below...13. ReunionA mile or so downstream, the water became wide and calm, though tinged with the reflections of flames leaping high into the air. I the middle of the river there was a tiny island where the creatures of the forest were taking refuge.Animals who had never touched water except to drink it were swimming carefully across the river now. A possum came slowly toward shore, her babies hanging upside down from her tail like a row of ornaments. Mrs. Raccoon laid the last baby of her damp brood down on the sandy bank and began licking its fur to warm it. Faline was standing at one end of the island, watching the water anxiously. Since she had fled from the dogs, she had seen no sign of Bambi. Surely no animals could still be alive in the forest, and it seemed like hours since she had crossed the water herself . . . then she gave a gasp of relief. Coming slowly across the river were the Great Prince and Bambi.Bambi had no idea whether Faline had made it to safety. His wound was beginning to ache again and he was conscious of how very tired he was. Just a little farther, he told himself as he struggled along searching the shoreline hopefully. Just a ... little farther . . .
Bambi! calle'd Faline eagerly.Bambi looked up and met her eyes. A burst of joy surged through him. She was safe!
His pain and exhaustion vanished, and he swam the last few yards easily. Then he was on shore, standing once again next to Faline. Bambi gazed silently into her eyes. There were no words for what he was feeling. He and Faline leaned wearily against each other and turned together to watch the forest. Above the remains of the trees, the sky was burning brighter than any sunset.14. The circle of LifeEven the blackened ruins of the forest held no power against spring. Another winter had ended, and now May's beautifying hand was passing lovingly across the charred landscape. Flowers were blooming everywhere. New leaves had sprouted from wounded branches, and a velvety coating of new spring grass was covering the scarred forest floor.The old owl's favorite tree had managed to escape the worst of the fire. He was dozing there peacefully one morning when Thumper and his four children dashed up to a fallen log under the tree.
All four of them began drumming loudly and shouting up at the owl. Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl! called Thumper excitedly.
Wake up, Friend Owl! echoed the little rabbits.
The owl let out a little wail. Oh, what now? he said irritably, blinking down at the rabbits.It's happened! It's happened! cried Thumper. Before the owl could ask any questions, the rabbits had dashed away.Next Flower came scurrying past. In the thicket! he explained to the mystified owl. Come on, Bambi! he then called out over his shoulder.
Yes, Papa, I'm coming, came a tiny voice behind himand a baby skunk waddled along after his father.Now that the Owl looked around, he could see that everyone in the forest seemed to be hurrying toward the thicket. Even the moles were tunneling along faster than usual, and Mrs. Quail's new line of chicks could hardly keep up with her. Still complaining under his breath, he launched himself into the sweet-smelling air.Faline was lying down in the thicket when the owl got there. Curled up next to her, staring wonderingly at the animals pressed around the thicket, was a tiny, perfect fawn.The spitting image of his father at that age, said the owl. Congratula . . .Suddenly he broke off. At the sound of his voice, a second fawn's head had popped up from behind her brother. She gazed at the owl in amazement, then gave him a shy smile.Two of them! gasped Mrs. Raccoon. The old owl chuckled. Yes, sir! I don't think I've ever seen a more likely-looking pair of fawns, he told Faline, who smiled graciously. Prince Bambi must be mighty proud.And he was. Bambi was standing guard on a cliff high above the thicket, where he could take in everything at a single glance -the thicket with his new family inside, the adoring circle of animals who were his friends, the forest springing into new life, and beyond, the wide green meadow-
As he gazed down over the scene, the Great Prince stood at his side. For a few minutes they watched the thicket together in silence. Slowly the old stag turned his serene gaze to Bambi, as if in farewell. Then without looking back, the Great Prince turned and walked away, leaving Bambi alone on the cliff.Bambi's heart was full. Sadness at the old stag's passing mingled with joy at the birth of his children and his love for Faline. He straightened his shoulders and lifted his head proudly. In the golden sunrise, he was a majestic figure indeed, the new Prince of the Forest.THE END

title: Hornblower: The Even Chance
synopsis: The film opens with seventeen-year-old Midshipman Horatio Hornblower (Ioan Gruffudd) coming aboard the HMS Justinian He is greeted by fifteen-year-old Midshipman Archie Kennedy (Jamie Bamber) and is introduced to Lieutenant Eccleston (Robert Bathurst) and Lieutenant Chadd (Roger May) who both welcome him aboard. Eccleston orders that Kennedy take Hornblower to the midshipman corner, and Kennedy does so. However, the midshipman's welcome is not as warm as that of Eccleston, Chadd, and Kennedy. Midshipman Cleveland (Frank Boyce) and Midshipman Hether (Richard Lumsden) are VERY rude to the younger midshipman. However, Midshipman Clayton (Duncan Bell) pays them no mind and asks Hornblower how old he is. Hornblower says he is seventeen, Hether automatically taunts this fact and says he highly doubts he knows the difference between a hat and a hanging and Hornblower says he doesn't, but he'll be sure it's the first thing he looks up. Clayton finds this funny, Hornblower excuses himself and suffers a spell of seasickness. Clayton gets him into a hammock and strips of his overcoat, throwing a blanket over Hornblower's weak body. Hornblower begs his pardon, Clayton assures him and tells him to lie quiet until he feels himself again. Hornblower falls asleep after a horrible first day.Hornblower wakes a bit later than expected the next morning, much to Eccleston's notice. Kennedy whispers to Hornblower that the captain is coming aboard and Clayton remarks that if ever a man was wrongly named it would most defintely be Captain Keene, due to his frail appearance. Hornblower whispers his gratitude to...Clayton who tells the young Midshipman that he should not mind Hether and Cleveland, that it is only their way and they'll get use to him. At that moment, the whistle blows and Captain Keene (Michael Byrne) is welcomed aboard. He calls Hornblower to his cabin and tells him that he was good friends with his father and asks about his health, Hornblower tells him that he is well enough. Keene laughs at the fact that a son of a doctor is surviving in the British navy, he asks Hornblower about his schooling and the only fact that Hornblower can offer is that he was a Grecian (an expert in the Greek language). Keene tells him if he minds his duties and does as he is told that no harm will come to him, he dismisses Hornblower. The same night, the men are settling down for the night with wine and music. Clayton plays his fiddle as Hether tells Horatio about the Indys, and that it is surely the place to be with its clear blue skies and waters to Hornblower says he would love to see it, Cleveland says he may if they can get off the Justinina one day. The dreaming and smiles ends abruptly when a shadow appears, a voice scowls You are in my seat the figure whom steps out of the shadows is none other than bullying Midshipman Jack Simpson (Dorian Healy). One of the midshipman quickly gets up from his seat at the head of the table, Simpson takes it for him. Simpson asks why nobdoy cheered for his return, Cleveland says that they never thought he would return. Simpson seems slightly offended by this comment. Hether asks Simpson about his comission, Simpson simply tells him it was refused. Hether says it was probably bad luck, Simpson says it was indeed bad luck and that due to this Lieutenant Jack Simpson is now lowly Midshipman Jack Simpson as he remarks sarcastically that he is at their services. Simpson finally notices Hornblower and asks his name and rank, Hornblower tells him both. Simpson asks what is on his plate, Hornblower says it's only mutton and ale. Simpson helps himself to Hornblower's food and drink, Hornblower says he had no right to do so. Simpson asks him if that is really true, there is a moment of silence. Simpson quietly asks for Kennedy, whom does not respond at first. Simpson shouts his name which finally snaps the young Midshipman out of his comatose-like trance. Simpson asks him if he has told Hornblower the rules, Kennedy shakes his head no and proceeds to do so. Only one rule: Every midshipman is to be sure that all fresh-cut meat and all the warm blankets go to Simpson. Hornblower asks to why they must do that, Kennedy says it's because he is a Senior Midshipman. Hornblower says they are all only midshipman, Simpson begs to differ. Hornblower says that regulations clearly do not say anything about a senior midshipman Simpson drives a dagger through the table and says that he pisses on regulations! Hornblower is clearly frightened, Simpson is right at his face when he tells him that this clearly a case of Mark Antony rendering unto Ceaser and he will leave Hornblower to decide who Caeser and who is to do the rendering. Clayton dives in to defend his friend and tells Simpson that Hornblower understands his meaning. Simpson backs off Hornblower and turns to Clayton, asking him to play a merry tune on his fiddle. Obviously afraid, Clayton obeys him. Simpson turns to Hornblower and tells him to cut them a rug Hornblower is still, Simpson orders again and Hornblower remains mum. By the third warning, Simpson has control of his temper yet again and Hornblower can no longer disobey. He stands to his feet and dances an Irish jig, after all that Simpson can only taunt Hornblower's horrible footing. Simpson turns to a deeply distracted Kennedy, and tells him that he will wake Hornblower every half hour in order to teach him a lesson. As night falls, all is calm and still until Kennedy suddenly has an uncontrollable seizure. Hornblower notices it and is instantly concerned, Simpson orders for Kennedy to shut up. Hornblower says he can't and tells Simpson that he is sick, Simpson could care less he only wants quiet. Hornblower kneels down to the floor and tries to calm Kennedy, Clayton joins him and says that it has started again and he had feared this would happen. Simpson tells Clayton that if Kennedy is unfit then he will take his duties in waking Hornblower, Clayton sorely agrees to the orders. Clayton and Hornblower move Kennedy back into his hammock, Clayton settles Kennedy until he is asleep once more, Clayton tells Kennedy that it was only a bad dream. Hornblower asks what ails him, Clayton turns to Horatio and shrugs What ails us all. Throughout the night, Hornblower is awaken every half-hour just as Simpson instructed. It is a very sleepless night for the young man.The next morning, Hornblower steps onto a very wet deck and almost slips but thankfully catches himself. Out of nowhere, Seaman Styles (Sean Gilder) climbs down from the watchtower and tells Hornblower that Lieutenant Eccleston wants to see him up at the watchtower, Hornblower asks him if he is sure and Styles say he is. Hornblower begins to climb up to the watchtower, as Styles watches down below with a cheeky grin. Suddenly, Hornblower's foot slips and he is left clinging onto the net absolutely petrified. It really was a trick, Simpson smiles and climbs down from the watchtower. Hornblower begs for his help, Simpson (while a coldhearted scoundrel) decides to help him down. Later in the day, the Midshipmen (save Clayton) are being tutored in ways of directions and equations. Captain Keene checks Simpson's work first, and chuckles as he sarcastically remarks We must all rejoice. The sources of the Nile have been discovered at last.What Keene can tell from Simpson's illerate scroll is that his ship is somewhere in Africa, Keene walks away from him obviously very dissapointed. Keene fails Cleveland, Hether, and Kennedy but not Hornblower who he describes as alone amongst these intellectual giants Keene orders Master Bowles (Colin MacLachlan) to be sure that Simpson pays further attention to his studies, he dismisses the midshipmen and walks away. Simpson watches Hornblower with a very displeasing look. Later that night, all seems calm and still even as Simpson enters the scene. Simpson says to Cleveland, Hether, and Kennedy that it is about time that they show the new Midshipmen the ropes, Simpson is ignored. Simpson there is no other candidate but Hornblower, he orders for Hether and Cleveland to clear off the table. Cleveland tries to protest, Simpson yells that they better do it or they WILL take his place. Hether and Cleveland quickly clean off the table, they force Hornblower onto it and hold him down. Simpson orders for a younger Midshipman to keep quiet, Simpson takes out rope and uses to strike Horatio's hide. Simpson tells Hornblower that he is a bit of dark horse for showing them up in front of Keene, he orders for Cleveland and Hether to turn Hornblower onto his back, they proceed to do so while Kennedy simply tunes the torture out and Clayton watches on helplessly. Simpson presses his body against Hornblower's, telling him that the purpose of this certain inquistion is for him to get to know him a bit better, he tells Hornblower that he knows all the Midshipmen and knows what knaws at their souls every night, he asks Hornblower what his dirty little secret is. He mockingly guesses that he is probably a homosexual (fancier of other boys,perhaps) he snatches a locket off of Hornblower's neck and chuckles, he then asks if Hornblower's mother makes a living on her back. Hornblower is instantly offended and headbutts Simpson, only to have the older midshipman continously beat his head against the table and his body shoved to the floor. Simpson orders that he gets up, Hether tells Simpson that he has won and orders him to stop. Simpson continues to kick Hornblower repeatedelly, Cleveland pleads for him to stop or he will surely kill him. Simpson finally stops, Cleveland orders for Hornblower to stay down but the determined young man stands to his feet. Simpson punches him and continues to beat on the helpless Hornblower, out of nowhere a pistol is held to Simpson's head. It is Clayton's pistol, Clayton orders for Simpson to stand off Simpson nervously states that he has no quarrel with Clayton. Clayton again warns him to stand off or he will trim the wall with his brains, Simpson lays off Hornblower. Clayton orders for the Midshipmen to take Hornblower to Doctor Hepplewhite, they quickly proceed to do so. After they leave, Simpson tells Clayton how bold he is with a pistol in hand. Simpson whacks the weapon out of Clayton's hand, Clayton backs away. Simpson tells Clayton that he knows him for the coward that he really is, he tightens a rope around his knuckles. A sure sign that like Hornblower, Clayton suffered some form of abuse that same night.The next morning, Eccleston is searching for Hornblower when he finally finds him. He is obviously angry, he tells Hornblower that he gave him specfic orders before Eccleston can continue his outburst, Hornblower turns to his commander. Eccleston's anger instantly turns to concern when he see's just how brusied Hornblower's face is, Eccleston asks what happened. Hornblower lies and says he just lost his footing and fell down the stairs, Eccleston can clearly tell that it's a lie because all of his face is brusied. Eccleston asks him again, Hornblower is silent. Eccleston orders for him to tell him or he will deal with the situation in a more leninent manner, Hornblower again says that he only fell. Eccleston sighs, obviously given up, he tells Hornblower that he will see if a spell in the gratings can't teach him to tread more carefully. As Eccleston walks away, Simpson shoots Hornblower a most evil glare and walks away. As the rain pours, Hornblower is tied to a net in a crucifixion manner, in a voiceover when he hear him write a letter to his father. He tells him that he is truly happy in the letter. Which is clearly not true.The next day after the skies have cleared, Clayton approaches an emotionless Hornblower and offers him a mug of ale (with just a drop of grog), Hornblower is not responding. Clayton calls out to him, Hornblower can only say death Clayton is terribly confused. Hornblower tells Clayton that he was thinking on death, Clayton sighs and asks whose death he was thinking on, Hornblower says he was thinking on his own. Clayton suggests that Hornblower desert, Hornblower says even if he were to do that he would not be free and that would give Simpson victory and THAT would surely be worse than death. Hornblower suggests that somebody should stand against Simpson, Clayton warns that the beating that Simpson gave Hornblower was nothing in comparsion to the other terrible things that he is very well capable of. After finishing off his warning, Eccleston and Simpson approach the two. Eccleston tells them that Simpson is take to a party of men ashore and rendevou with Lieutenant Chalk of the HMS Golilath and he gives Hornblower the order to accompany them, Hornblower agrees. Simpson, Hornblower, and some other crewmembers of the Justinina meet up with Lieutenant Chalk (Oliver Montgomery) who asks whom Hornblower is. Simpson introduces him as Horatio Hornblower, or he is better known as the Midshipman who was seasick at Spithead. Chalk looks a bit relcutant to accept Hornblower after hearing this fact, he tells them that they are to keep watch until they come across their allies. A few hours later, it seems that Hornblower is the only one whom is keeping watch as Simpson is inside The Lamb Inn and having a drink, Hornblower steps inside. Simpson tells Hornblower to give a toast to someone, Hornblower quickly says to raise a glass to the King, Simpson only chuckles. Lieutenant Chalk arrives with one of his lieutenants, he tells them that while they wait for word if they would care to join him in a game of cards to pass the time. Both of the gentleman agree to do so. As the men play the card game Robber, Hornblower begins to swipe the winnings when Simpson tries to stop him but he still proceeds as he folds out his cards, saying that the rest are his. Simpson is confused. Chalk says that Hornblower had five tricks, he reminds Simpson that the game is Robber.  Simpson is still confused, Hornblower says it is only a simple mathmetical caculation, Simpson mutters He knows the back of the cards as well as he knows the front. Hornblower hears him and calls the remark out as an insult, Chalk defends Simpson and says Simpson can probably explain. Hornblower tells Chalk that he was accused of cheating at cards and that's a very hard thing to explain, Chalk continues to defend and says that Simpson was simply speaking subconciously and requests that the order another bottle of wine and drink it in the vanity of friendship. Hornblower says he will do, and with the great pleasure, if Simpson apologizes to him and admits that he spoke out of terms. Simpson smirks Apologize to you? Never the sight of Hell. Hornblower asks Chalk and the fellow Lieutenant if they heard it for themselves, Simpson had just insulted Hornblower again and refused to apologize. Hornblower says that there is only way that satisfaction can be given now.A duel? Are you mad?! Kennedy exclaims, Hornblower is back on the Justinina and has just told Kennedy and Clayton about his plans to challenge Simpson to a duel. Hornblower clearly tells Kennedy that this duel will be the end of it, whether he wins or loses he will be rid of Simpson either way. He notes that he has a pretty even chance of winning. Kennedy argues in saying that Simpson is the best shot in the Navy and that he will Hornblower for sure, Hornblower and Kennedy turn to Clayton who has remained mum. Clayton tells Hornblower that he will act as his second, of course but he must know if Hornblower has fought a duel before. Kennedy turns to a silent Hornblower, it is pretty obvious that he has not fought in a duel beforehand. The next morning, Clayton stands on deck and takes a drink from his flask as the longboats pull out. Clayton see's a special tool and picks it up, he heads below deck and finds Hornblower bracing himself for the duel. Clayton asks if he is ready, Hornblower nods his head. Clayton sighs and draws a bit closer, he asks Hornblower if there is any way for him to change his mind, Hornblower shakes his head. Clayton sighs once more and asks for Hornblower to hand him his cloak, as Hornblower reaches for the wrapping he is knocked out cold by Clayton. In the woods, a carriage speeds to the sight of the duel. Two people step out of the carriage, Clayton and Kennedy. They approach Simpson, Hether, Cleveland and Doctor Hepplewhite (Simon Markey). Simpson asks where Hornblower is, Clayton tells Simpson that Hornblower has met with an accident and won't be able to fight in the duel. Simpson smirks in saying You mean the little coward has pissed himself? Clayton ignores the remark and tells them that his duties as Hornblower's second means he will stand proxy, Hepplewhite doesn't understand. Clayton tells him that he will fight in Hornblower's place, he says he won't however if Simpson chooses to remove his accusation against Hornblower, Simpson says he will never do that. Hepplewhite tells Clayton that this is most likely illegal, Clayton says whether it is legal or illegal that it would settle the matter and says that he is here and that Simpson is not afraid of him. Back on the Justinina, Hornblower regains concious and instantly knows what has happened, he races off. Back in the woods, Clayton and Simpson are about ten steps apart from each other and have their pistols in hand. Hepplewhite goes over the rules and asks the gentlemen if they are ready, Simpson and Clayton both say they are. Hepplewhite calls fire and both guns shoot off, Simpson is shot in the shoulder and falls to the ground bleeding. Clayton tells Simpson that he got him, not aware that he has blood coming from his own mouth. Clayton falls to his knees and collapses, blood is spouring from his gut. Moments later, Hornblower is seen racing towards The Lamb Inn through a snow-covered England. He hears shouts coming from inside and steps into the inn, he see's Hether and Cleveland patching up Simpson's shoulder so he is clearly not the one he heard yelling. Hornblower fears the worse. Cleveland points up stairs, Hornblower storms up the stairs and charges into an open room where he see's a bleeding Clayton and a very dismayed Kennedy and Hepplewhite. Hornblower goes to Clayton's bedside and takes his hand, Clayton apologizes for not killing Simpson, all of the sudden there are shouts from outside. Clayton asks what they are shouting about, Hornblower says he doesn't know and orders Kennedy to go outside and find out. Kennedy leaves the room, Hornblower sits on Clayton's bed and asks him the pretty obvious question: why? Clayton tells Hornblower that he was right, somebody needed to stand up to Simpson but it couldn't be a boy. Clayton lets out a cough as Hornblower frightfully looks to a sadden Hepplewhite for answers, Clayton continues in saying that Hornblower shamed him and that they could have cowered together and runned forever, Hornblower shakes his head. Clayton tells Hornblower that he actually thought he could beat Simpson, after all he had an even chance Hornblower and Clayton smile until Clayton finds himself unable to breathe, he tightens his grip on Hornblower's hand and asks the young Midshipman if it is evening. Within that moment, Clayton dies. An upset Hornblower heads for the exit of the inn when Simpson calls out to him, he remarks that he isn't finished with him and that he will flail Hornblower alive. Hornblower quickly steps outside and tries to gather his thoughts, Kennedy approaches him with a smile and says that he is dead. Hornblower says yes, Kennedy says he wasn't referring to Clayton he was referring to the fact that the French have murdered King Louis and that means only one thing: war is coming. The next morning aboard the Justinina, Cleveland and Hether are playing cards while Hornblower seems too be in deep shock and grief over the recent death of Clayton. Kennedy comes down to the Midshipmen's corner, Hether asks what is happening. Kennedy tells them that half the crew is to remain aboard the Justinina, Cleveland and Hether look dismay. Kennedy says, however, that the other half are to transfer. Hether orders Kennedy to tell who got the transfer, Kennedy says that Keene has reccommended their transferral to the HMS Indefatigable. Hether hits the ceiling (literally), while Cleveland tells Hornblower that it's a frigate and it will mean prize money, Hornblower is unresponsive. Kennedy tells them that Clayton always wanted to sail on a frigate. Later that night, Hornblower goes to Keene and tells him that he wishes to remain aboard the Justinina. Keene says, that while he respects Hornblower's loyalty, this is a terrific opportunity for him and that he will accept it whether he likes it or not, he dismisses Hornblower. The next morning, half of the crew (that includes all midshipmen) head for open waters and spot the goodship Indefatigable, Hornblower can't help but smile for the first time in days. When they reach the ship, there is a speech held by the ship's captain Sir Edward Pellew (Robert Lindsay) that ends with a loud God save the King! from all the crew, that includes Hornblower who has finally found himself able to speak since the loss of his friend.Hornblower is sent to Pellew's cabin, Pellew is looking over Hornblower's letter of recommendation and tells him that Simpson has recovered but will remain on board the Justinina with Keene, Pellew asks Hornblower if that upsets him but Hornblower isn't sure how to answer. Pellew hopes that Keene will now be a bit wiser and now will be able to notice just what is going on aboard his ship, Hornblower defends his former Captain's actions. Pellew tells Hornblower that's it's not his job to damn him nor defend him Hornblower agrees. Pellew tells Hornblower to remember that while a Captain is aboard his own ship, that nothing is out of his control and he will do well to remember that, Hornblower says he will. Pellew goes on in saying that he doesn't judge a man from actions, but his actions have already cost the Navy two men: one injured and one dead. Hornblower protests in saying that nobody mourns Clayton as much as he does, and that he resents that comment. Pellew fights back with a loud (and probably the famous quote from the series) Damn your impudence,sir! Hornblower is silent. Pellew gives Hornblower a comission, telling him to never fight another duel and Hornblower agrees to it. Pellew continues and asks Hornblower if he has the opportunity of meeting the seamen aboard the Justinina, Hornblower says he hasn't but he has met them. Pellew tells him that they are all in his charge due thanks to Simpson's injury. Hornblower calls the seamen in for the role call afterwards, their names are as followed, Stevens, Williams, Oldroyd (Simon Sherlock), Matthews (Paul Copley), Finch (Christopher Barnes), and a white-flake-face Styles (whom we've already seen). Hornblower asks Styles what happened to his face, Finch is about to say something but Matthews nudges him as if he is saying for him to stop. Styles says it is only boils, Hornblower asks if he has done anything about them and Styles say he has. Hornblower wishes to know what he has done, Styles says he puts plaster on them. Oldroyd suddenly begins to laugh, Hornblower tells Styles that he and the others will obey him or they will suffer the consquences of disobedience, Hornblower snaps his head and asks Oldroyd what is so funny and Oldroyd says nothing. Hornblower asks Styles if he understands, Styles says he does. As Hornblower walks away, Styles whacks Finch's hat off his head as punishment for almost telling their secret. Suspecting their is something afoul amongst his new crew, Hornblower steps below deck later in the day to investigate, what he discovers is the seamen gambling and they are using rats as the dice, trying to kill them with everything but their hands. Which means that Styles was bitten and did not have boils like he said. Oldroyd says Styles' final count is five, Styles argues that it was six. Oldroyd protests, Styles says that the sixth rat is dead and waves him in front of Oldroyd's face to prove it. Matthews tries to step in between the argument, which almost leads to a fight between the men until Hornblower finally makes his presence known. Hornblower is solemn in expression as he tells the men that he expected more from the likes of them, Styles says they aren't on duty and Hornblower says that they are gambling which is clearly worse. Hornblower asks them if they know the consquences for gambling: they could be condemned or flogged or possibly worse. Styles gives him a foul stare, Hornblower tells him that if he gets one more look like that then he WILL go to Eccleston. Matthews orders for Styles to quit, Styles looks away from Hornblower. Matthews says to Hornblower that Simpson allowed this to happen, Hornblower tells him that Simpson is no longer in charge of them that he is and he wants to see them all on deck front and center. Styles is about to protest, when Hornblower shouts: I'VE SAID IT AND I MEAN IT Styles and the others are silent. Hornblower says he wants them all on deck, Matthews (or Styles) asks Hornblower if he is going to go to Lieutenant Eccleston, Hornblower says no because he will give them one last chance to earn his trust but if they do disobey him again then he will, he asks if he is clear and the men agree that he is. Hornblower tells Styles to replaster his face, for Matthews to get rid of the rats, he seems as he is about to order Oldroyd when he simply tells him that the final count was indeed six. Kennedy suddenly comes below deck and orders for the men to head for quarters, there is battle going on! The drums sound as Eccleston, Chadd, Kennedy, and Hornblower move alongside the cannons. They each call for the cannons to fire, they go off and the French simply fight back by letting off one large cannon which kills a few of the men aboard the Indefatigable, Williams has had his leg severed. Hornblower goes to him and orders for Styles to help move him down below, the two carry Williams off and take him below where they lay him on a table. Hornblower, who is getting cleaned up because of a terrible injury to the eye, orders for Hepplewhite to take care of Williams but Hepplewhite is busy removing a stencil from Chadd's arm. Hornblower tells Hepplewhite that if he doesn't do something now that Williams will surely bleed to death, Chadd is about to protest when Williams begins yelling. Chadd tells Hepplewhite to treat Williams, he can wait and Hepplewhite proceeds to do so. Styles and Hornblower return to deck when they realize that the Indefatigable has already won victory, Kennedy races up to Hornblower and tells him that they carried her by boarding and that he killed at least two men, Kennedy tells Hornblower that he should've been there. Hornblower once again finds his mind thinking on the loss of his dear friend, Clayton. Only a few hours later, do we learn that Hornblower's efforts were useless as see a funeral being held for only one man: Davy Williams. After Williams' body is condemned to sea, Styles thanks Hornblower for at least trying to save his friend's life and Hornblower tells him to tell the others that they are welcome. Styles salutes him and walks away, Hornblower says that a salute is a start. But it will take awhile before the seamen can trust him and he them.Later in the week, the Indefatigable comes across a French convoy. Eccleston, who we learn speaks French, tells them that it is indeed a French ship carrying supplies. After the ship is captured, Eccleston proceeds to tell Pellew that there is another French ship, the Marie Gallante, which needs to be under their command. Pellew orders Hornblower to take his men and take command of the Gallante, Kennedy congraluates Hornblower on his first command ever. Hornblower, Styles, Oldroyd, Finch, Matthews, and Stevens climb aboard The Marie Gallante, all they see is a very drunk crew and the stubborn Captain Forget (Vincent Grass). Forget says that he is already wanted in London and he refuses to return to a place where he will very hang, Hornblower says no matter what Forget says he will be sent back to London and he will be hanged, Hornblower orders Styles to stop drinking. Hornblower tells Oldroyd to take Forget's crew down below, Hornblower asks Matthews if he has been at seas the longest, Matthews proudly says he has served for 13 years. Hornblower appoints him as his first mate and orders for them to set sail, Matthews and Styles are not moving. Hornblower asks them what they are waiting for, those were his orders. Matthews suggests that they should put Forget's crew to work as well, Hornblower smiles and says that was his intention. Hornblower warns Matthews that since they are drunk they might refuse, Matthews assures that they can get them to work drunk or sober. A few days later, Hornblower steps into his cabin and something about his compass causes him to mutter a colorful vocabulary. He dozes off and dreams about a dreadful fate for Pellew, when he wakes up he discovers there's a problem. There is a hole in the ship, Hornblower dives in and tries to seal the hole off with netting. It works, for the time being. However, there's another problem arising. There is way too much rice on the ship, everybody knows in order to the survive that they must call abandon ship and Hornblower agrees. Hornblower is the last one into the rowboat as he gathers his compass and maps, every watches with heavy hearts as the Marie Gallante is condemend to the ocean depths.So now it's Hornblower & his men, and Forget & his men all in one rowboat. Forget's men are doing all the work, which displeases the French captain. Forget walks over to Hornblower, trying to get a good look at the compass. Hornblower quickly closes it, Forget argues with him and finally holds Hornblower at gunpoint, demmanding the charts & compass. Hornblower hands him the charts with no problem, but things get really heated when Hornblower deliberately tosses the compass overboard and suggests that Forget fish for it. Forget slaps Hornblower, Styles whips out his gun and is ready to shoot. Hornblower orders that Styles lowers his gun, and he does. Forget keeps a solemn face That was a foolish thing to do, boy. I might have killed you. Hornblower smiles as he wipes his lips dry of the blood and responds And forgo the pleasure of crowing at my discomfort? I think not. Hornblower & his men are now at the mercy of Forget, as they continue on their journey. One day, Finch is serving some water to all of the men when he accidentally trips and angers Forget. Forget's men hold Finch as they are about to execute him, Hornblower and the others take out their pistols and Forget argues for them to put them away and so they do and Finch is released. As night falls, Hornblower is awake when he see's the moon dissapearing behind the clouds and with a smile, he falls back asleep. The next morning, Hornblower's men are confused as to why Hornblower gave Forget charge in the first place as they note they are probably heading for France. Hornblower says they will never find the coastline to begin with, since Hornblower himself wrote the wrong direction on the chart meaning that Forget is sailing further away from his destination instead of closer. Suddenly, Forget and one of his men begin arguing and the man is hit and thrown to the floor. Hornblower grabs the pistol off the man and holds it to Forget, where they debate for awhile until the Indefatigable comes into view in order to aid our young Midshipman and take the Frenchies back to London. When they reach the Indefatigable, we see Forget & his men walk off to the brig as the seamen and Hornblower step aboard and congratulated on a job well-done. Hornblower goes to greet Kennedy, when he is suddenly called upon by Pellew. Moments later, Pellew is congratulating Hornblower on a job well-done. When suddenly, a French frigate named the Papillon is spotted. All hands beat to quarters, pretty soon the Papillon vanishes into the mist. When they spot the remains of one of their own ships, not knowing if there are any surviors: Pellew sends Hornblower and a few of his men to search the waters. Hornblower & his crew hop into a rowboat (deja vu) and row into the midst of the ocean. They find a couple of men, clinging onto their life as know it. They are pulled into the boat, Hornblower gives his coat to keep them warm. As he goes to pull in another survivor, he see's a very familiar tattoo spread across the man's knuckle. Their eyes meet. It is indeed Simpson, alive and well.When they come back aboard, all the officers are called to Pellew's cabin where Simpson fakes a few tears and tells them the tragic story of how the Justinina was condemned to the ocean. Hornblower and Kennedy watch each other, aware of just how well Simpson can act. Pellew tells Simpson to not distress himself further and he pulls out his maps, saying that the only way to defeat the Papillon is to overtake it. As Eccleston discusses these plans, Hornblower and Kennedy alike begin to become haunted with the voice of Simpson as it rings in their heads. When the map rolls back up, the two jump, obviously coming out of their trances. Pellew orders for Eccleston to take the officers whom are under his command and attack the Papillon, Simpson insists that he comes along due to the fact that he was aboard and knows the ship well. Pellew asks Eccleston on Simpson's behalf, and Eccleston says they would love to have him on this mission and he insists that he will travel with Hornblower and Kennedy. Kennedy is obviously displeased, as is Hornblower. Simpson only shrugs. Later on, Kennedy goes below deck and see's his hat and as he reaches to grab it he hears a voice behind him. He turns to see Simpson, whom tells him just how much he has missed him. As he is about to advance on Kennedy, Hornblower enters the scene. Simpson tells Hornblower that he and Kennedy were only catching up on old times, Hornblower says that these are new times and he has no hold over them whilst aboard the Indefatigable. Simpson says no, he looks at Kennedy and repeats himself. Hornblower excuses himself and Kennedy and they walk away, Simpson watches them in the shadows. As night falls, everyone is preparing to sneak aboard the Papillon. Eccleston observes his men, to be sure they are well-prepared. Hornblower whispers to Kennedy if he is nervous, there is no answer. As the men pile into the rowboats and head for the Papillon, there seems to be no complication in their plan. Until, Kennedy falls to the ground and is obviously having another one of his fits. Everyone is aware if he keeps yelling then he will disturb everyone aboard the Papillon, Matthews and Oldroyd hold him as Hornblower urges him to be quiet and he is unable. Oldroyd gets his hand over Kennedy's mouth but it does not help in any form, Hornblower finally finds a tool, very similiar to the one that Clayton used on his own head, and he clubs Kennedy ultimately knocking him out. They finally reach the Papillon, all of the men begin to quietly climb up the sides of the ship as Hornblower makes it aboard. He tries to be as quiet as possible, however the silence is shortlived when he trips over a bucket. Two guards hear him, and he shoots them dead. The others come aboard and attack the crew of the Papillon, with all this fighting and shouting they realize the important thing is to set the sails. Eccleston sends Hornblower and some of the seamen up to perform this task. So, Hornblower along with Matthews, Finch, and Oldroyd climb up while Eccleston and the others continue to kill the men of the Papillon. While climbing, Stevens tries to get to the sail himself by jumping onto it but Hornblower protests. Stevens attempts and fails, falling to his death. The others make it to the top, and try to find a way across. Chadd and Eccleston are down below and growing deeply worried as to why Hornblower is frozen and not obeying his orders. Hornblower takes a deep breath and begins to walk along the sail, treating it like a balance beam. It doesn't help that he is deathly afraid of heights, or that he if falls he wouldn't survive. Eccleston smiles as Hornblower finally makes it to the other side and he and Finch begin to work untying the sail. Simpson looks up and realizes that Hornblower is once again doing something he finds displeasurable, being the hero. Simpson refuses to see the PERFECT man make it out of this alive, and he knows the perfect way to be rid of him. He grabs a knife off one of the dead officers and cuts the ropes that are keeping the rowboat still, and watches as the rowboat begins to move away with Kennedy in it! Hornblower finally gets the sail prepared when he see's Kennedy unconcious and inside a moving rowboat, this distracts him long enough for Simpson to lift his pistol and shoot Hornblower square in the brow. Hornblower falls into the water, and we believe him to drown. Simpson goes to Eccleston and tells him that the French have fallen back and that the ship is theirs, Eccleston praises God and tells Simpson to give his regards to Hornblower. Simpson reports that Hornblower fell into the water and is most likely dead, Eccleston seems suscpcious. We see Hornblower drifting closer to the bottom of the ocean, when Finch grabs him and rescues him.The next morning, the Indefatigable is on the watch when Pellew see's that the Papillon is about to find itself in a horrid battle. Aboard the Papillon, Finch is cleaning Hornblower's wound when he says that while he was shot he will make a good recovery. Hornblower asks what happened to Kennedy, Styles and Oldroyd inform him that the rowboat nor Kennedy were found. Terribly distraught, Hornblower goes to see a bloodied Eccleston who tells him that those French will do anything to see victory, obviously referring to Hornblower's gun wound. Hornblower says it wasn't a Frenchie who shot him, it was Simpson. Eccleston warns Hornblower that he just made a serious accusation against another officer, Hornblower swears it's the truth. They can hear the sounds of distance cannons, Eccleston quickly tells Hornblower that he will address the matter when they get back aboard the Indefatigable. Suddenly, another cannon fires and hits the Papillon it sends Hornblower flying into the air and he lands. He's a bit brusied but overall in good condition, Matthews helps him to his feet and Hornbower rushes to see if Eccleston is all right. Apparently he isn't, both Chadd and Eccleston are crushed underneath a fallen pole. Eccleston is so out of it that he mistakes Hornblower for Chadd, Hornblower assures him that it's only him as in Mr.Hornblower, Hornblower yells for a surgeon. Eccleston wants to know if Chadd is all right, Bowles checks Chadd for a pulse and alas there is none. Hornblower tells Eccleston that Chadd is dead, Eccleston with what little strength he has leaves his final command. He tells Hornblower that he is Captain of the Papollion, and tells him to make it back to Indefatigable safely. With those final words, Eccleston dies in peace. Hornblower is upset by this sudden loss, however Simpson is less than sympathetic. He orders for both of the bodies to be condemned and to set the sails, Hornblower says that Eccleston left him in charge and tells Bowles to tell Simpson. Bowles reminds Hornblower that Simpson is senior officer, Hornblower argues since he was left orders by a higher ranking than they must fall out. Hornblower orders Matthews and Styles to take Simpson below, but Simpson protests and yells that he is charge. Hornblower stands his ground, he tells Bowles to be sure that Simpson arrives at the brig without a problem and if he gives anybody ANY trouble, he has his permission to shoot him. Simpson is taken to the brig, just as the Papollion is put under attack. With Hornblower as Captain, he barely manages to save the life of his crew & the ship. They arrive back aboard the Indefatigable, Pellew again congraluates him. He sadly says that judging by everything, that Hornblower is in charge and Eccleston is...Hornblower confirms that Eccleston is indeed dead. Pellew sighs and asks how Hornblower sustained such an awful injury.Seconds later, we are in Pellew's cabin. Simpson accuses Hornblower of telling a damn lie he apologizes for using such language. Simpson accuses Hornblower of lying just because he cowarded when he was meant to face off with him, Simpson even says he challenged Hornblower once more but he refused. Pellew warns Simpson to not speak out of terms, he tells Simpson that he gave Hornblower a comission which makes him enabled to take part in any form of a duel. Pellew removes the comission but advises Hornblower against it. Hornblower has made up his mind and make this statement: I maintain the charge against Mr.Simpson, sir! However, since I cannot prove it other than with my body, I have no choice but to accept his challenge! The next morning, Hornblower is on land. Along with the seamen, Hepplewhite, and Simpson. Another duel is about to be taken underway. Simpson and Hornblower stand back to back, Simpson tries to distract Hornblower by whispering the terrible reminder of Clayton's death and how he will kill him just as he did him. Hornblower does his best to ignore it, trying not to think on Clayton. Simpson says he will also die just as Kennedy did, this gets to Hornblower but not enough to distract him on the task at hand. Hepplewhite tells the men to take ten steps away from each other, they do so. They face each other and lift their pistols, Hepplewhite goes over the rules and asks them if they understand. They both nod. Hepplewhite is able to count to two, before Simpson fires and shoots Hornblower in the shoulder. Hepplewhite argues with Simpson while the others check on Hornblower, Simpson asks if he killed him. Hornblower grunts and picks himself off the ground, he lunges himself at Simpson and attacks him and steals his pistol away. With two pistols in his hand, Hornblower is shocked when Simpson falls to his knees and begs for Hornblower not to shoot him. A sadden Hornblower, fires into the air which shocks Simpson. Hornblower tells Simpson he isn't worth the powder, he turns to walk away. Simpson takes this as an insult and finds his knife, as he races at Hornblower another gunshot rings into the air. Hornblower turns and see's Simpson is shot in the chest, he dies moments later. Who fired? Surely not Hornblower. The camera scans over to the rocks, we see Bowles and Pellew standing together. Bowles asks Pellew if he may congraluate him on an expectional shot, Pellew says he may. Aboard the Indefatigable, Hornblower thanks Pellew for killing Simpson. Pellew accepts his gratitude and then tells Hornblower his own words of wisdom: You have fought your duel. That is well. Never fight another. That is better. The film comes to its close as Hornblower and Pellew overlook the men of the Indefatigable and sail for another journey.

title: 1408
synopsis: The movie opens with a strong rainstorm on a road. We see a car approaching us. The car stops by a local lodge. A man gets out and runs in soaking wet. This man is Mike Enslin (John Cusack). He walks up to the front desk and starts talking to the elderly couple who run the establishment. They tell him how they've been expecting him. It is explained quickly through their conversation that Mike is an author of cheesy horror tour guide books. He travels from place to place, staying at supposedly haunted places and then writing summaries of them for his books. As he talks with the couple they try and tell him all about the history of the lodge and how a servant of the house once hanged herself and the female head of the house lost all five of her children to tuberculosis in the bed Mike will be staying in. Mike however, seems totally perfunctory about these stories. He seems to be very apathetic to the history of the place and clearly feels he knows as much as he needs to. He just wants to stay in the room so he can study it once again like he has done so many other times. Later we see Mike in the attic room that is claimed to be haunted but it seems totally mundane and harmless. As time passes Mike walks around and checks the place out. He even breaks out of equipment which he uses to test for the presence of supernatural forces. It is all to no avail though. The room is a regular room and Mike falls asleep.The next morning Mike wakes up and promptly leaves, He heads to a book signing he is scheduled to attend in a small book store. When he arrives he sees a stand setup but no one is there to greet him and there doesn't seem to be anyone there lined up to see him. Mike heads to the counter and tells the man there he is here for his book event. The man at first seems totally oblivious to what Mike is talking about. Mike shows him a pamphlet with his picture on it from the store announcing the event. Then the store guy seems to recall. The clerk at the counter announces the event over the loudspeaker of the store to the sparse number of patrons. However, most seem to show little or no interest. Next, we see Mike talking about his various books at the event, which is attended by 4 or 5 people. He talks of his various derivative books like The 10 Scariest Mansions and The 10 Scariest Lighthouses. One of the attendees asks him if his experiences have lead him to believe in ghosts. Mike says all this stuff is fantasy and that nothing in all of his travels has ever been out of the ordinary and would lead to believe in such things as much as he might like to. He sarcastically tells one of the people if he really wants to see a ghost he should head to the Haunted Mansion in Orlando. As he signs the various horror guide books for the handful in attendance. A young girl walks up to him and places a book before him called The Long Road Home that he wrote. Mike is astounded that the girl has a copy of this book. It is clear this is not one of his horror books. The girl says her name is Anna and she tells him how she was genuinely touched and moved by the book and how it seemed too authentic, especially the part about the relationship between the father and son. She asks him if it really happened. Mike says no. However, his expression clearly indicates that is not quite true. He seems flattered by her words, but clearly he doesn't want to linger on this point. When she asks him if he is ever going to write another book like it, Mike says that period is over now.After the book event Mike heads back to his home base in Los Angeles. While there he goes for some surfing down by the beach. As Mike is surfing he surfaces from the water and sees a plane flying over his head. The plane has a message banner attached to it. As Mike tries to read it he gets distracted and fails to see the huge wave that is headed for him. The wave sends Mike reeling and he eventually washes up on the beach chocking water with a guy asking him if he is alright. Later Mike goes to the post office to pick up his mail. We then see him at a local diner opening up his mail. Most of them are advertisements for more supposedly haunted locations that the owners want Mike to visit and write about. One of these is a post card that catches Mikes eye. It is a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. On the back of the postcard is a single warning message: DON'T ENTER 1408! Mike examines the room number and writes =13 on the card realizing this is what the sum of the numbers is. Clever he comments.Next Mike phones his New York publishing office and speaks to his publisher Sam Farrell (Tony Shalhoub). He tells him he plans on making the Room 1408 of the Dolphin the final location for his newest touring book. Sam tells him it sounds like a really cool possibility, but asks Mike if he really wants to come back to New York after all that happened. Mike says he is over that now, but its clear that Mike is still deeply affected by something that occurred there. Mike then sets out researching newspaper clippings of the incidents that have transpired with the former occupants of the Dolphins infamous room. He finds one article in particular of the first victim of the room. A wealthy businessman who inexplicably jumped from the window of the room while staying there just 1 week after the hotel opened. Mike then calls the hotel itself and tells them he would like to make a reservation. They say fine, but then Mike says he wants room 1408 and they immediately reply that it is unavailable. Mike says he never gave a date. He keeps persisting them in asking when it will be made available, but they keep saying it wont and eventually hang up on him. Mike thinks this is some sort of ploy. He speaks to Farrell again and he tells Mike that physically they cannot prevent Mike from renting the room according to the law. If it is available as a hotel they must rent any available room to him according to official operational New York guidelines. Mike says this is great and tells them to go ahead and make the reservation. Farrell asks Mike if he is sure about this given the rooms incredibly sordid and wicked history. Mike says he isn't concerned and prepares to head for the Dolphin.Next we see Mike arriving at the Dolphin Hotel. It isn't at all the sort of creepy and macabre establishment he expects and that most of the places he visits try to be. It looks like a regular hotel. He enters the lobby and finds it quite busy. He approaches the counter and speaks to the woman there. Mike tells her who he is and that he is here to check into Room 1408. However, as soon as she enters his information on the computer an alert comes up to immediately notify the manager before letting Mike Enslin check in. She tells him to wait a moment. While he is waiting a hotel lobby bellboy walks over and asks Mike is he can take his bag. Mike says no and the worker politely walks on. Shortly thereafter Mike meets the manager of the hotel Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson). Gerald asks Mike if he can please accompany him back to his office and says he needs to discuss the matter of Mike staying in Room 1408. Mike agrees to this and the two head off.Inside Gerald Olin's office, Gerald tries to tell Mike about why he must not stay in Room 1408. He first offers Mike a bottle of some expensive Bourbon on the house as a friendly gesture, which Mike takes. He then goes through the rooms gruesome and hideous history and how dozens of people have killed themselves inside the room in all sorts of shocking manners. However, as he says all this Mike interrupts him and starts continuing what Gerald was saying about the entire grizzly history of the room. Gerald smiles and says I see you've done your homework well. However, he tells Mike he doesn't know the whole story. That in addition to all the suicides there have been over 20 natural deaths in the room of various circumstances like strokes, heart attacks, and people who appeared to have literally appeared to have panicked to death. Mike seems startled by this news but remains largely stoic about all of it. He tells Gerald that by staying in 1408 he will write a nice piece of it in his next book and increase the hotels occupancy by 50%. Gerald tells him the hotel usually runs at 90% capacity and doesnt need Mike to promulgate the hotel in one of his books. Gerald tells Mike that the hotel doesn't seek any kind of attention to 1408. That it only fears the room claiming more victims. He continues that no one has ever stayed in room 1408 and lived and in fact no one has lasted more than an hour. He pulls out of a folder of case files of the rooms myriad of victims and tells Mike that in all 56 people have died in there. Gerald says this isn't about publicity or anything else; he just doesnt want to see anyone else die in there. He offers to let Mike see the folder along with staying in Room 1404 which has the same layout if he will just agree not to stay in 1408. Mike says no. Gerald becomes aggravated and throws Mike the folder and says Here! Just look at it! Mike examines the folder and peruses the photos of its many unfortunate former occupants as Gerald recounts their stories, in particular one of a man who was found stitching his own body parts together. Mike is clearly perturbed by this, but still insists on going to 1408. When Gerald asks Mike why he is so adamant about staying in Room 1408 despite all the grizzly stories he has told him Mike responds that he has stayed in countless places over the years where slaughters have occurred and he remains unscathed. Gerald finally relents and takes Mike to get the key for 1408. It is a regular old style brass key. Mike asks why and Gerald tells him that no electronic cards will work with the room for some reason. Mike jokes and says What the phantoms don't like modern innovations? Gerald tells him he never said anything about a phantom or a ghost or any such thing. He leans in towards Mike and says It's an evil fucking room!We next see Mike and Gerald on the elevator up to the 14th floor. Mike inquires about how the room is maintained being as haunted as it is. Gerald tells him that once a month he and the hotel staff go up to the room in a special visit, to change the bulbs and sheets among other things. He says they always go in groups and the door remains open at all times. He tells Mike they treat the room like its a biological hazard zone. However, he says once they were cleaning up 1408 and a maid wandered into the bathroom and the door of it closed on her. Gerald says the maid was only in there for less than a minute. Mike says Let me guess she died? Gerald says No, she went blind! He says she poked her own eyes out from sheer madness laughing as they pulled her out. Mike is clearly distressed by all Gerald has told him but when the elevator stops Mike gets off. Gerald says this is as far as he goes and gives Mike one final warning to please not go to 1408. Mike just continues on and the elevator door closes. Mike moves down the hallway of the 14th floor. At first it seems normal with a maid passing by and a few hotel guests entering rooms. However, something seems eerily unsettling. Mike continues to 1408 and opens the door with the key. Initially he finds the experience totally anti-climactic. The room looks totally banal and mundane. Just like any regular modern hotel room. He walks in and shuts the door.Initially Mike starts to get used to his surroundings. He checks out the room, but there doesn't seem to be anything unusual. It has all the usual amenities of a typical hotel room including a copy of The Bible. Mike lays down on the bed and proceeds to make sardonically mocking comments into a voice recorder he brought with him about how much a joke it is that people speak with such fear of this room. As time passes by Mike gets up goes to the two windows of 1408 to look out. As Mike looks out the window he suddenly hears some weird noise of movement behind him. As Mike turns around he suddenly sees two chocolates laid on his pillow from out of nowhere. He goes into the bathroom and sees the toilet paper has been replaced Mike laughs and thinks this is some ruse by the hotel staff to try and scare him. He says Lovely! I have the ghost who does turn down service in here. Mike thinks whoever did the changes must still be in the room, but despite looking everywhere he cannot find anyone. A series of bizarre but trivial events starts occurring afterward. Noises, flashes, and other weird happenings seem to be going on, however, nothing that cannot be easily explained. Then the heat in the room starts getting out of control. Mike is convinced this is all the doing of the hotel staff to make him leave the room. Mike calls the hotel operator to complain. He demands they send someone to fix it. The operator agrees. Mike seems surprised with how easily she complies with his demands given the fact he think the hotel staff is trying to antagonize him. After a little bit a mechanic arrives at the door, Mike tries to open the door but it is stuck. After pulling on it with great force it finally opens sending Mike to the floor. He sees the mechanic at the door and tells him to come in and fix the thermostat, but the man refuses saying there is no way he is entering 1408. Mike asks how he is supposed to fix the temperature. The guy tells him he can talk him through it and just has Mike tap on a switch in the box. The cooling comes back on. Mike thanks him, but by the time he turns around to look at him he is already gone and the door closed.Mike goes back to relaxing in the room, just as he drinks Bourbon a little, the clock radio turns on itself, playing We've Only Just Begun by The Carpenters, freaking him out. The clock in the room he notices has even begun a countdown from 60 minutes. Initially this doesn't bother Mike much but as the events continue he becomes more and more terrified. Mike hears a high-pitch tingling and becomes deaf temporarily. His hand is crushed by the window, then he went to the bathroom to wash the wounds but suddenly the faucet runs from cool to hot water. Mike tries to close the faucet with a towel but it fails then he kicks the sink, stopping the faucet. Back to the room to put a bandage in a wounded hand, then the clock radio again turns itself on, playing the same song. Mike quickly pulls the radio, disconnecting the cord but its clock still counting down. The telephone rings and Mike picks up. The woman operator he spoke to earlier picks up again. Mike is livid about what has been happening, but the operator is different now, rude and almost mocking, telling Mike to calm down and not speak to her in such a harsh tone of voice. She tells Mike she will put the manager on, but Mike waits and the manager never comes.Mike hangs up the phone and grabs his stuff and then makes a run for the door. However, just as he opens the door, the key breaks. He then tries to unlock the door with the knife and it unlocks, but the door knob breaks, the door is now locked and no matter how many times Mike pulls and bangs on it, it will not open. Mike goes back over to the bed and sees a spectre of an old man (who looks like the same man who was the first one to commit suicide in the room) emerge from the wall the ghostly spectre goes over towards the window and jumps out. Then another female ghostly spectre appears and jumps out of the other window. Mike goes over to the window and looks out. Across the street he can see a man sitting in a building through a window on the other side of the street. Mike tries to signal and scream to the man. The man across the street gets up and takes a look at Mike. Mike keeps signalling to him and sees the man across the street signalling back, but eventually he realizes this person across the street is just mimicking his own actions. Mike cannot understand what is going on. He takes the lamp he has been holding in his hand trying to signal the other man and holds it up to his face. When he does so the man across the street does the same and Mike sees the man across the street is actually him. He then sees a figure with a knife approaching the mirror version of him across the street from behind. Mike turns around and is attacked by the same hideous figure that eventually vanishes. Mike 
picks up the lamp and tries to throw it out the window towards the ground to try and get the attention of the people and cars he can see passing below, but as he drops it the lamp just vanishes. Mike tries to go back towards the door, but it still wont open. He now looks over at the lampshade of the lamp he just dropped out the window. It still has light coming out of it despite there being no lamp.Mike is now convinced he must be hallucinating. He looks over at the bottle of Bourbon that Gerald gave him and one of the chocolates left on his bed that he ate. He realizes these could've been used to drug him. Suddenly the TV in his room turns on. A old scene from his life comes on the TV. He sees himself playing with his wife Lily Enslin (Mary McCormack) and their daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). As Mike watches this old memory he comes visibly morose and distraught. He puts his hand up to the TV, but the scene vanishes. Mike hears more of the commotion from the next room over he had heard earlier. He hears a baby crying, he knocks on the wall and asks the woman he assumes must be with the baby to help him, but no one responds. Instead the baby's crying gets progressively louder and louder, until it becomes absolutely deafening. Mike falls to the floor and throws a chair at the wall and the noise finally dissipates. Mike now realizes he must escape.He goes back over to the window. All the while Mike has been saying comments into a voice recorder he brought with him to document his stay in 1408. He makes one comment into the voice recorder as he prepares to go out the window that if something were to happen to him he would want anyone who found the recorder to know it was because he slipped and fell and it was an accident. It was not that the room drove him to kill himself. Mike looks the hotel's floor plan of the 14th floor for escape plan. Mike goes out of the window and gets on the ledge. He figures he can make his way across to the window of the next room over. However, as Mike keeps going further and further away he wonders how much further it must be. Mike then looks down the ledge but he cannot see any other windows except room 1408. Mike realizes he cannot go further and makes his way back to the window he came from, but as he tries to go back in the ghost of the woman who jumped before startles him. She then jumps again and as Mike watches her fall she vanishes before hitting the ground.Mike finally goes back to the room and he sees the floor plan has changed, showing the only room 1408 is in the middle of the building. He also sees another scene from his past. This time, part of the room next to him turns into a hospital room and we see Mike consoling his wife Lilly about the current status of their daughters health. He tells her everything will be alright. Sitting next to them in a hospital bed is Katie who can hear what they are saying and is clearly concerned. Next the walls start to bleed. Mike tries to calm himself by saying that this must all be a nightmare, but he wonders why he cannot wake up. He tries to shock himself out of his dream by looking out of the window, as he does the rooms elevation seems to rise dramatically and Mike falls back in sheer fright. Eventually this all culminates in the room becoming like a whirlwind, overwhelming with paranormal activity. When Mike finally recovers from this disorienting event he finds the room around has physically changed appearance. The windows are now covered over in a white preventing him from looking out. The entire room is now bathed in a powerful and ominous white light. The rooms wallpaper has changed to one of white flowers and everything else seems to have been modified in a peculiar way. The temperature has also dropped dramatically.Mike then sees that another one of the sections of the room has become another scene from his past. He sees an old man sitting in a chair in what looks like a mental home. This time Mike walks up to the man and talks to him. The man complains about why he is here. Mike realizes this man is his father. His father smiles and tells Mike that soon Mike will be driven insane like him. Mike now realizes he must try and contact someone on the outside. Previously he had tried his cell phone, but he could not get a signal. Now he tries the wireless connection on his laptop. By some miracle he is able to get through. He manages to get a video signal through to his wife Lilly. Lilly is astounded to see Mike and wants to know why after all this time he has finally contacted her. Mike tells her he cannot explain. What is going on, but she must help him. He begs her to send the police to where he is. He tells her he is in New York at the Dolphin Hotel. Lilly is surprised he is back in New York which is also where she is. She keeps asking Mike why he hasn't been in communication in so long but Mike just tells her to please send the police to where he is. She seems baffled as to why, but Mike begs her to just do it. Suddenly the sprinkler system cuts on and short circuits Mike's laptop breaking their conversation. Mike is furious and doesn't even know if his wife got the message. Mike looks back over at the clock to see it is still ticking down Mike realizes again he must try to escape.He goes over to the room's door. Mike had previously seen a air duct above the room. He hopes he can crawl through the ducts to get out. Mike manages to climb up and get into the ducts. As he begins moving through the air ducts he can see more scenes from his life as he passes the air ducts of the rooms below, including one of his wife tending to his daughter as a baby. Mike keeps trying to go on, but suddenly he finds himself pursued by a grotesque looking old man. The old man starts crawling after Mike and keeps grabbing on to him. Finally Mike kicks the old mans face shattering it. Mike finally falls back down the air duct to Room 1408. He finds the temperature has dropped yet again and the room is now completely covered in snow. Mike walks back over to the floor plan and sees it has now changed. It only shows 1408 and nothing but blackness around it. Mike looks through the keyhole and sees just a wall.Mike tries to burn the various articles in the room to try and keep warm. As he does he witnesses more scenes from his past. He sees a scene of his sick daughter back in the hospital with his wife. They are trying to tell Katie that everything will be alright and that she doesnt have to worry about dying. Mike tries his best to keep her spirits up, but it is obvious he has real doubts and fears. Finally we see Mike and Lilly in their home bereaved and commiserating over their daughters death. Mike is angry at his wife for his feeling that she Filled Katie's head with fantasies of a heaven, instead of willing her to fight! He clearly has lost all his faith and is consumed with despair. Mike then sees a vision in the wall. It is Gerald Olin back in his office... Gerald begins talking to Mike. Mike is furious at him but Gerald says he gave Mike every chance to pass on staying in 1408. He tells Mike that he should not have been so skeptical and doubtful of paranormal activity and ghosts in his books and appearances all those years. He says there is a reason why people believe in this sort of thing, for the glimmer of hope that there really is something beyond death. Mike tries to reach for Gerald to hit him, but he just finds himself punching a wall.Mike is finally ready to give up when he hears his wife on his laptop again contacting him. He runs over to it and tells her if she sent the police to 1408. His wife says the police are in 1408 and it is empty. Mike now realizes the full power of 1408. The room has now transported him into some kind of separate dimension from the reality he has in. Mike tries to tell his wife he is done for and that he is going to die. His wife says Mike is crazy and that she is going to come down there to him. Mike then pleads with her not to do this, but suddenly he realizes she is not hearing him. Then Mike sees a new window on his laptop open up. This time the video image is of him. The new image of Mike begins talking to his wife telling her to come down to 1408 and please join him. Mike begins screaming to the video of his wife on the laptop but to no avail. She can only hear the words of the impostor on the laptop. After she logs off the false Mike looks directly at the real Mike and smiles and then winks. Mike now realizes its not just his life in peril. He screams in utter rage. The rooms paranormal activity reaches its pinnacle. The entire room starts coming alive even the pictures on the wall. One of the pictures, a scene of a ship in a violent storm begins pouring water into the room. Soon the entire room is gone and Mike is trapped underwater, above him though he sees a light being emitted from the surface. As Mike swims towards it he comes up and realizes he is no longer in 1408. He is back on the beach from the beginning of the film. He looks up and sees the plane from earlier flying overhead and this time he can read the message on it, it says to get great life insurance call XXX-1408. Mike eventually finds himself back on the beach from before where he washed up.Mike then comes to in a hospital in LA. He sees his wife Lilly sitting next to him. He asks her if he is in NY, but she tells him he is in LA and that he never went to NY. He explains to his wife that had a vivid dream of going to NY and staying in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. His wife says she has never heard of it. We then see the two of them in a restaurant and his wife is telling Mike how the dream must've been a metaphor he concocted based on the events of his life. Mike seems composed, but he suddenly sees a waitress who looks exactly like the suicidal ghost from 1408. Mike becomes flustered, but then he looks back over and sees it is not that woman. Mikes wife then suggest he write about the experience. We then see Mike researching the same stories from before of the victims of 1408 but this time they are different and the victims are unrelated and didn't die in 1408. We then see Mike writing about the experience of 1408 on his computer and how it was a hellish dream he built in his mind. Finally Mike brings his completed manuscript of the 1408 story to the post office to mail it to the NY office, but as he gets to the counter he suddenly notices the man at the counter is not the usual guy, It is the bellboy he met earlier at the Dolphin, Mike turns around and sees some guys working on the wall behind him, but they too are workers from the Dolphin hotel. Suddenly they all begin tearing down the walls of the post office and behind them emerges Room 1408. Mike now realizes the nightmare is going to begin again anew.Mike is back in 1408 - is in ruins - but he cannot believe it. He keeps telling himself I WAS OUT! Mike looks back at the clock. It is still ticking down. Eventually Mikes daughter appears before him. Mike doesnt believe this is the real Katie. She asks him Don't you love me anymore? Mike falls to his knees and grabs Katie in his arms. He tells Katie he loves her and they will be together forever. However, suddenly Mike feels Katie go limp. He looks at Katie only to find her slumped dead in his arms. Mike begins to weep uncontrollably and falls to the floor. You cant take her from me twice he explains. The clock radio - still intact - turns itself on, playing the same song. The body of his daughter crumbles before him into dust. Mike becomes furious and smashes anything in a room.
Mike watches the last few moments of the hour pass on the clock.When the clock is over, Mike arises back in Room 1408 - back in normal. The clock has reset and has begun ticking back down from 60 minutes. We see Mike sitting at a chair answering a ringing phone. He picks it up and asks Why don't you just kill me? We then hear the same annoying and rude woman hotel operator from before because all our guests enjoy free will sir! She tells him You can either repeat this hour over and over forever or you can take advantage of our express checkout! Mike then looks over to see a noose dangling above the bed. Mike sees himself disappears in a mirror and then he sees the two graves, his daughter's grave and Mike's grave to be burried. Then in a mirror, Mike sees himself hanging through the mirror's image. This doesn't freak him out much. Mike goes back to the desk and picks up a receiver. The operator says, Are you ready to checkout? His answer is no and he hangs up the phone. The telephone rings and he answer it. The operator says, Your wife will be here soon and I will be sure to send her right up. Just remember there is no escape! Mike tells the operator that the room will not have her. He then says that if he is going down then he is going to be sure that Room 1408 joins him. Mike picks up the bottle of Bourbon from before which is now full again and puts a string into it. He lights the string turning it into a Molotov cocktail and then throws it at the wall. The room begins to erupt in flames. Some ways away we see Mikes wife Lilly in a cab near The Dolphin. She asks what is going on at the hotel as something is clearly awry. She jumps out of the cab and runs to the hotel and sees the fire. Guests are storming out of the hotel and into the streets. Lilly runs up to the fireman and begs them to help her husband. Meanwhile we see Mike back in 1408 smiling and laughing knowing he has beat the room even if this means his death. He crawls under a table as the room is engulfed in flames around him. Mike thinks this is it, but then the fireman breaks through the door and pulls him out. Outside the room in the hallway Mike tells them not to go in there because its cursed. They just ignore him figuring he is delirious from the trauma. As the fireman drag him out we see Gerald back in his office saying Well done Mr. Enslin..Later Mike awakens again in a hospital to find Lilly again at his side. Mike explains to her what happened and how he knows that all he has written about all these years and dismissed is actually real. His wife seems skeptical and believes Mike may be delusional from the experience of all that happened. Eventually we see Mike and Lilly back together in their home. Mike is going through his old things in boxes. Lilly finds Mike's stuff he brought back with him from the Dolphin Hotel. Lilly says they should just throw it out since it stinks and it brings back bad memories. Mike grabs them and says no telling her that bad memories are not to be forgotten, they are meant to be lived with. Lilly now realizes Mike is ready to move beyond his daughters death, though she is still doubtful of the 1408 haunting. In the things, Mike finds the recorder he had with him in 1408 that he occasionally used to comment on the events in the room. Mike realizes he had the recorder on longer than he thought. He fast forwards to the end of the tape. Mike hears the part where is talking to his daughter as Lilly listens too. Suddenly they both hear Katie on the tape. Mike and Lilly are both bewildered as they realize 1408 is very real.****************************************************************************************************************
Alternative (Original) endingDirector Mikael Håfström has stated that the ending for 1408 was re-shot because test audiences felt that the original ending was too much of a downer. The original ending, available on the two-disc collector's edition, sees the back draft engulfing the room as Enslin hides under the table, happy to see the room destroyed as he dies. During Enslin's funeral, Olin approaches Lily and Enslin's agent where he unsuccessfully attempts to give her a box of Enslin's possessions including the tape rresecorder. Before being cut-off Olin claims that the room was successfully destroyed and that it will no longer harm anyone ever again, hence why he claims Enslin did not die in vain. Going back to his car, Olin listens to the recording in his car, becoming visibly upset when he hears Katie's voice on the tape. He looks in the car mirror and imagines seeing a glimpse of Enslin's burnt corpse in the backseat. Having heard and seen enough, Olin places the tape recorder back in the box and drives off.The film ends at the gutted room, with an apparition of Enslin looking out the window and smoking a cigarette. He hears his daughter calling his name, and disappears as he walks towards the room's door. A sound of a door closing is heard and the screen blacks out.

title: A Night at the Opera
synopsis: In Milan, wealthy dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) has hired sly, wisecracking business manager Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) to help her enter society, but he merely helps himself to her money. At dinner in a fancy restaurant, he introduces her to opera impresario Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman). Gottlieb tries to persuade her to hire famed Italian tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) for his New York opera company, and takes her to watch an opera performance with Lassparri as lead. Claypool is impressed and agrees to hire Lasspari for $1000 a night. Determined to cut himself a piece of the pie, Driftwood decides to sign Lassparri for the New York opera company first, and rushes backstage after the opera to find him.Back stage, Lassparri is a total jerk who beats his playful, mute assistant Tomasso (Harpo Marx). He tries to romance beautiful chorus member Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle). However, she has two problems with that - first, Lassparri is an arrogant, rude, egotistical brute, and second, she's in love with Riccardo Baroni (Allan Jones.) Riccardo sings in the chorus, hoping for his break to stardom. Riccardo meets up with his old friend Fiorello (Chico Marx), Tomasso's partner, who declares himself Riccardo's manager and decides to help him move further in the opera world. Looking to sign Lassparri before Gottlieb gets to him, Driftwood wanders backstage and runs into Fiorello, who claims to be the manager of the greatest tenor in the world. Excited, Driftwood whips out 2 questionable contracts for him and Fiorello to sign- however, due to Fiorello's stupidity and inability to read and Driftwood's sarcasm, a comical scene unfolds where they argue incessantly about clauses stating things like in this contract, the party of the first part shall be known as the party of the first part and so on. They end up ripping both contracts to shreds, though they both agree they have a contract. At this point, Gottlieb and Claypool arrive backstage and find Lassparri and sign him up - Fiorello informs a confused Driftwood that HE signed Riccardo Baroni!Gottlieb prepares to set sail for New York at once with Mrs. Claypool, Driftwood, and Lassparri. Also joining the group is Rosa, at Lassparri's request to have her as a leading lady; sadly, this means leaving Riccardo behind. As everyone boards the boat, Lassparri is begged by the papparazzi to sing for the crowd, but he feigns laryngitis: Why should I sing if I'm not being paid for it? Instead, Rosa sings Alone, a popular love song. Riccardo, on the dock, joins in. While he is singing, Rosa asks Gottlieb to consider bringing Riccardo along. He tells her that Riccardo has a nice voice, but will have to wait until he has developed a reputation.On the boat, Driftwood finds Rosa crying and delivers to her a love letter from Riccardo to cheer her up. As the smartass conman rides luggage carts to his room, he finds that Gottlieb's set him up in a room no bigger than a storage closet, in which his suitcase takes up half the room. An angry Driftwood opens his luggage to find his clothes gone, and that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo have stowed away inside: after all, Driftwood DID sign Riccardo to the company. Not wanting to get caught with the illegal stowaways, Driftwood demands the 3 leave: Fiorello will only leave after they've been fed. Driftwood then orders multiple plates of food (with multiple hard-boiled eggs) to the room.What begins now is the stateroom scene, one of the most famous comedy scenes of all time. Already crowded in the closet-sized room are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Riccardo, and the giant suitcase. Slowly, more people begin crowding in the room: two maids come in to make the bed, the engineer and his large assistant come in to fix the heat, and a manicurist shows up to do Driftwood's nails. The already too-small room becomes too crowded as all this action takes place at the same time, and Driftwood continues to let more people in: a cleaning woman comes in to clean up, a young woman looking for her Aunt Minnie tries to use the phone, and finally, the servers with all the food. All these people try to fit in the room with their seperate duties as a smirking Driftwood remarks, Say, is it my imagination or is it getting crowded in here? Finally, Mrs. Claypool comes by and opens the door, and all 15 people come crashing out of the room into the hallway.That night, there are festivities going up on the ship's main deck, including a big dinner where Lassparri tries hitting on Rosa, who rejects him yet again, and a dance. An honor is given to three famous aviators with large beards, who are traveling to New York City for a large ceremony. Mrs. Claypool tells Driftwood she doesn't want him associating with Fiorello and Tomasso, as they are riff-raff, far below her social class. Meanwhile, bored inside their stateroom, Fiorello, Tomasso and Riccardo sneak up to the main deck and help themselves to dinner. Afterwards, Fiorello starts to play the piano and Tomasso plays the harp, much to the enjoyment of the children on board. However, Lassparri spots the three stowaways and informs the crewmembers: they chase the stowaways and throw them into the detention cabin.Locked up in the brig the next day, Tomasso plays the harmonica much to Fiorello's annoyance, who throws the harmonica out the window into the ocean. Tomasso jumps out the window and into the ocean to get his harmonica. Driftwood, spotting Tomasso from an open window, tosses him the rope to the anchor. Tomasso grabs on to the rope and is lifted back up on to the ship, landing in the stateroom of the three bearded aviators, who lay in bed asleep. Seeing as how the stowaways are illegally entering the country, Tomasso gets an idea to get them safely into New York City, takes out a pair of scissors, and goes to work...The boat docks in New York City. When the papparazzi try to get the 3 aviators from their room, Driftwood impersonates as their manager, and takes the bearded aviators - Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo wearing the shaved-beards as disguises- off the boat. The 3 real aviators are left tied up and gagged to their bed. The aviators and Driftwood are taken to a large ceremony at City Hall, where thousands upon thousands of people stand audience in the city, watching. The Mayor presents the 3 aviators with awards and asks them to talk about their accomplishments. Fiorello gives a fake, messed up speech to the crowds, while Tomasso drinks multiple glasses of water to stall time, leading Police Sgt. Henderson (Robert Emmett O'Connor) to suspect that the trio are imposters. The trio pretend to be offended by the sergeant's accusations and storm off, leading him to apologize to the Mayor and Tomasso. Tomasso hugs him- but when he does, his fake beard comes off, exposing their ruse. Everyone goes mad trying to catch the illegal frauds as they escape.Word is out all over New York City and on the front page of the next day's newspapers as police look for Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo. Driftwood, hiding the trio in his hotel room as to avoid arrest and deportation, shows the news to them and demands they leave before he gets arrested. Before they can, Sgt. Henderson comes knocking at the door to investigate Driftwood's room. As Driftwood tries to slyly deal with Henderson and make him leave, Fiorello Tomasso and Riccardo hide on the fire escape between the kitchen area and the bedroom. As Henderson moves back and forth between the two rooms, the three stowaways use the fire escape to move furniture from the bedroom into the kitchen, leading Henderson to believe he's losing his mind and gone crazy until Driftwood finally gets him to leave.The day of the big opera finally arrives: Il Trovatore starring Lassparri and Rosa. As Rosa prepares in her room, Riccardo visits and they reunite. However, Lassparri enters and becomes disappointed when he sees the two together, and angry when Riccardo kicks him out of the room. Meanwhile, Driftwood arrives at the theater and gets a happy reception from the chorus: only for Gottlieb to tell Driftwood that Mrs. Claypool has officially dispensed with his services for associating with the riffraff (Fiorello and Tomasso), and he is fired. Driftwood is kicked down the staircase and thrown out of the theater, now unemployed.Out of a job, out of money, and kicked out of his hotel, Driftwood is left with nothing else but a bench in Central Park, with Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo still with him. Incredibly resentful of how his life is pretty much ruined, he wishes he never met any of them and to be back in Milan. Rosa shows up heartbroken and in tears: she informs the group that, because she doesn't love Lassparri, Lassparri persuaded Gottlieb to fire her from the opera, and she has been replaced with another diva. Fed up with how far Gottlieb and Lassparri have gone, Driftwood decides enough is enough: he begins to plot revenge, the way only the Marx Brothers can...That night, crowds have filled the big theater to see the opera. Gottlieb arrives in a fancy suit and enters his office: only to find Driftwood, Tomasso, and Fiorello smoking his cigars and eating his dinner. As he tries to call the police, the three of them knock him out and strip him of his clothes, which Driftwood puts on. Their plan has begun: destroy the opera. Driftwood takes Gottlieb's spot in the box seat next to Mrs. Claypool, and delivers a smart-mouthed speech to the audience as the orchestra gets ready. However, sitting in the orchestra causing trouble are Fiorello and Tomasso, who distract the maestro by tapping on instruments. Gottlieb, having woken up and put on Driftwood's too-small clothes, gets to the orchestra box to catch Driftwood, he jumps out and runs for it. Gottlieb sends his men after him and calls the police.What happens next is 7 minutes of the most amazing operatic mayhem ever to visit the movie screen.Fiorello and Tomasso have inserted Take Me Out to the Ballgame into the musicians' sheet music. When they reach that point and start playing it, the two begin playing baseball in the orchestra, as Driftwood walks around the audience selling peanuts. Gottlieb chases Fiorello and Tomasso into the storage area under the stage, where they knock him out yet again. Driftwood remains running around the opera house, making snarky comments towards everything as Gottlieb's men chase him.The curtain rises and the opera begins... with Fiorello and Tomasso in costume on the stage with the chorus. They begin to run amok, ripping off singers' clothing and generally causing havoc in the scene. Sgt. Henderson and his police guards arrive backstage, ready to catch and arrest Driftwood and his illegal friends. They find Gottlieb and wake him up, and inform him that the 3 are still out there, sabotaging the opera. Dressing up in costume, the 2 men sneak on to the stage in the middle of the scene to catch Tomasso. However, he escapes by climbing up the backdrop of the stage and disappearing into the rafters of the opera house. He then begins swinging, Tarzan-style, on the ropes and pulleys backstage. This causes various inappropriate backdrops--vendor pushcarts, trolleybuses, and a battleship--to move up and down on the stage while Lassparri is singing. In one case a backdrop is actually in front of Lassparri. Tomasso then swings directly over the stage, making a daring flying snatch of Lassparri's wig.The police are chasing him all over the backstage area, also swinging on ropes. When Tomasso is cornered, he jumps directly down a backdrop, tearing it in two. The police corner him on the ground, and he runs/climbs back UP the backdrop, then swings on a rope over to the electrical control panel.He turns off all the lights. Lassparri, still singing solo despite the chaos, suddenly starts to scream but is silenced. When the power is restored, Lassparri is missing! While it was dark, Fiorello and Driftwood have kidnapped, bound, and gagged him, and put him in a box hanging up in the rafters. The box is held up by the ropes controlled by Tomasso. The 4 are completely out of sight of anyone below.Gottlieb is in a panic. He needs a tenor for the next song. Suddenly, Riccardo and Rosa walk in. Gottlieb begs Riccardo to sing lead in the opera. Riccardo points out that he has no reputation, (as Gottlieb had pointed out at the start of the voyage.) He demands that his counterpart in the duet be Rosa, since they have practiced it. Gottlieb has no choice but to put both of them in costume and send them out on stage.Riccardo and Rosa put on an amazing performance of the sad duet Miserere. In contrast to the preceding raucous goings-on, the audience now pays rapt and appreciative attention to the new singers. Even Gottlieb is impressed. (Ms. Carlisle and Mr. Jones were classically trained; they did their own singing.) At the end of the song, there is thunderous applause. After Riccardo and Rosa go off stage, Lassparri is released. He angrily demands to go out on stage, saying I'll sing them an encore that they will never forget. But the audience will have nothing of this. They boo him off the stage. He storms out of the opera house.Gottlieb's course of action is clear. Riccardo and Rosa will be the new stars of the opera company. After quickly consenting to a few demands--all criminal charges will be dropped, and Driftwood will get his job back--he sends the two back on stage for an encore before the enthusiastic audience. All ends happily, or will end happily as soon as Driftwood, Fiorello, and Gottlieb can agree on a contract. Which requires agreement about the role of the party of the tenth part.

title: Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium
synopsis: from PluggedinOnline.com:Mr. Magorium never outgrew his toys--pretty remarkable, considering the guy is 243 years old.Magorium, a lively fellow with wild hair, who has a pet zebra named Mortimer and a fondness for shoes, has been running Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium for the last century or so. It's a place that makes Toys 'R' Us look like the DMVwhere Legos build themselves, fish-mobiles are made with real, wriggling fish, and balsa-wood dinosaurs play with Frisbees.But big changes are ahead. See, Mr. Magorium has worn out his last pair of favorite shoes, and since he bought enough to last a lifetime, he knows he's about to die, er, depart, as he puts it. So Magorium hires a stuffy accountant (whom he immediately dubs Mutant) to determine what his store is worth and prepares to hand the whole thing over to his day-to-day manager, Molly Mahoney.POSITIVE ELEMENTS:
The doubt-filled Mahoney has her own problems. And this candy-colored film creatively uses them to teach us all a thing or two about life. When she was a child, everyone told her she was a musical prodigy, and she still has aspirations of fulfilling her promise. But now, as an adult, she's still working at, well, a toy store. Sure, it's magical and all, but it's not the sort of job one boasts about at class reunions.She is horrified when she learns of Magorium's plans and tells him flat-out that he's got to keep living and dealing with the store himself. After all, she points out, the place is called Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. It rhymes! she exclaims, and she takes it upon herself to show her eccentric boss all the small wonders of the world he'd miss out on if he decided to, um, depart. What kind of things? Things like dancing on Bubble Wrap, jumping on furniture-store beds and, inexplicably, making calls from pay phones.The Emporium isn't so keen on Magorium leaving, either: The bright red walls begin turning a charred gray in anticipation and, on Magorium's apparent last day, it throws a temper tantrum. In so doing it reveals to attentively watching children just how childish such outbursts are.Maybe it needs a time-out, says Eric, a hat-loving store regular.Eric, a boy of about 9, is the film's voice of rationality. But he's struggling, too. His hat-wearing ways and penchant for elaborate Lincoln Log sculptures make kids his own age steer well clear. But his mom and Mr. Magorium are urging him to try to make friends. So he does. He reaches out to the Mutant. He begins to write notes to the guy, holding them up to the window of the store's office, where the Mutant is poring over centuries-old receipts.Would you like to play checkers? Eric scribbles. Sorry, Mutant writes back. I'm working.How about when you're done working? Eric returns.I never stop working.But he does eventually stop working. And before film's end, Mutant and Eric are playing pretend and having loads of fun with the best of 'em.Thus, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is crammed with winsome, childlike wisdom, coaxing nursery-rhyme-like precepts from its characters and their relationships. They're archetypes, really: The accountant who can't see the magic around him; the shunned, shy little boy; and the uncertain store manager who feels she was made to do great(er) things.When Mahoney first asks the Mutant whether he sees a sparkle in hersomething reflective of something bigger trying to get out, he's befuddled. But not for long. Indeed, all the characters here carry with them a hidden sparkle. And each one journeys toward getting it to show.Through it all Magorium serves as ringmaster, part silly man-child and part wise sage. Confronting his own mortality, he tells the store the only thing they can do is face the coming day with determination, joy and bravery. When Mahoney takes Magorium to a clock store so they can listen to all the clocks strike 12, she breathlessly whispers they only have 37 secondsall they have to do is wait.Magorium corrects her, saying that it's 37 seconds to breathe, reflect, enjoy, regenerate, dream.Thirty-seven seconds well used is a lifetime, he says.In the end, this is largely a tale about the wonder of life, the inevitability of death and the struggle to bring those two conflicting ideas together. That's oddly heavy stuff for a G-rated flick about a magical toy store, but it's handled quite deftly and in ways that even its youngest viewers will understand. Stories, even the ones we love the most, must eventually come to an end, we're told. I'm only asking that you turn the page, Magorium tells a weeping Mahoney. Continue reading. And let the next story begin.SPIRITUAL EMELMENTS:
Spirituality enters at right angles. The Mutant scolds Magorium at one point for keeping fictional characters on his payroll. As an example, he points to an entry for the King of Planet Yahweh. Oh, he's not fictional, Magorium said, though he admits the planet is hokum. He's definitely not fictional.When Magorium tries to make it clear he's departing, it's Eric who understands first. I think it means he's going to heaven, he says. Magorium agrees, then adds other places he might wind up in, including the Happy Hunting Grounds and Shangri La. He concludes with, I may return as a bumblebee.VIOLENT CONENT:
When a 2-year-old throws a tantrum, it's bad enough. When a huge toy store throws one, things get downright crazy. One girl gets covered in goo. A boy runs around with a lemur attached to his head. Another shopper, reading a book about the sea, gets attacked by a squid. (She makes a formal, and wet, complaint to Magorium with the squid still clutching her cranium.) Objects fly off shelves. Glass breaks. Pandemonium ensues.A kid rudely stomps on Mutant's toe. A towering red gym ball squishes (harmlessly) a young shopper against a door. Magorium opens the door and says, Pretty impressive ball, isn't it? Impossible to dodge.CONCLUSION;
I remember my first pinwheelhow, when I took it outside, the wind would catch it, and sunshine would glint off its metallic plastic sleeves. For a 5-year-old, it was ... magic.There's lots of magic like this in Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. Stuffed animals cozy up to would-be owners, a gigantic magic book poofs toys into instantaneous existence, and bouncy balls try to sneak out of the store via shoppers' bags. This isn't the kind of magic you find in Macbeth or Harry Potter or even The Chronicles of Narnia. This is the special magic with which most children engage during their first precious years, when the world is filled with wonder and newness and outrageous possibilities. The Emporium is a place where imagination sparks reality; where paper planes can paint a cosmos.

title: Red River
synopsis: In 1851, Tom Dunson (John Wayne) and friend Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan), join a wagon train in St. Louis (or near St. Louis), headed for California. After three weeks, they approach north Texas, where the land looks good to Tom. He decides he wants to break away from the wagon train and go find a place to start a ranch of his own. The wagon master tries to order him to stay, then tries talking him out of it, all to no avail. Tom is also pretty handy with his fists and a gun, so there wouldnt be any forcing him.Along with Tom and Nadine on the trip to California is Fen (Colleen Gray), Toms love interest. He and Fen are basically engaged (in love, anyway) and she wants to come with Tom and Nadine to find a ranch. Tom wont hear of it, promising to send for her once hes settled in. She doesn't like the idea of having to wait, but promises to come. Before leaving, Tom gives Fen a bracelet that belonged to his mother.Tom and Nadine take off with their wagon, horse, one bull and two cows, and get maybe 10-15 miles from the wagon train, near the Red River, when they look back and see black smoke. Realizing that the wagon train has most likely been attacked by Indians, they know they cant get back in time to help, and that some of the Indians are likely to come looking for them soon enough anyway, so they set up in a defensive posture and wait.Sure enough, maybe 6-7 Indian braves show up and begin an attack with a fire arrow that hits Tom's and Nadine's wagon (but doesnt do much damage). Both Tom and Nadine are good shots and they kill most of the attackers right away. However, one of their cows was killed by the Indians and then Tom has to fight hand-to-hand. He kills one Indian as they fight and fall into the river. Tom notices the Indian he killed was wearing the bracelet hed given to Fey. Tom then sneaks out to kill the last one or two Indians of the group, who were still out there hiding.The next day, theres a young boy named Matt Garth (Mickey Kuhn) who comes strolling along leading a cow and talking to himself, like hes lost his mind. Tom slaps the kid to snap him out of his trance. The kid then pulls a hand gun and points it at Tom. Tom grabs the gun and takes it away, knocking the kid down. The kid is not crazy, but just play-acting. Tom tells him never to pull a gun on him again. The kid has spunk and tells Tom never to take his gun from him again. Tom turns to Nadine and says, hell do. Tom hands Matt's gun back to him and allows him to come with them. Apparently, the family or group Matt had been with was attacked by Indians too, so he had no one left.The three of them travel deep into Texas, stopping at the Rio Grande, where Tom pronounces himself the new owner of all the land visible north of the river. He also says that 10 years hence, hell have the biggest and best ranch in all of Texas, with plenty of beef to feed and nourish all the people around the area. He tells Garth and Groot that he will brand all the cattle in his future herd with a D double bar (the bars representing the banks of the Red River). Matt wants an M added to the brand, but Dunson says he'll have to earn it.Two Mexican men come riding up and introduce themselves as employees of Don Diego, the man who owns the land they are standing on. At that moment, Don Diego was at his ranch headquarters 400 miles south, in Mexico. Tom tells the two men to ride back and tell Don Diego that all the land north of the Rio Grande now belongs to him and hes taking it. One of the men says that just cant be and he goes for his gun. Tom outdraws him and shoots him dead. He tells the other man to take his friends horse and go back and tell Don Diego what happened. Tom told the guy that he would take care of burying the other man's body.Flash forward nearly 15 years later to find Tom, Nadine and a grown Matt (Montgomery Clift) having a discussion about Matts recent return to the ranch, and the major problem of there being no market in Texas for all of Toms thousands of cattle (thanks to the Civil War basically bankrupting everyone). The decision is that they will need to drive the cattle north instead, to Missouri, to sell them. Tom was going to make Nadine stay behind, as Nadine was getting too old to ride, but the trail cook had just quit, so Nadine got to go, as the cowboys would need a cook.Tom and Nadine had a funny exchange, right after Tom had told Nadine he had to stay behind. Nadine was talking to himself, complaining about the decision, while Tom was trying to talk to Matt. Tom finally turned to Nadine and asked him what he was saying and why didnt he have his new teeth in his mouth, because he couldnt understand his mumbling. Nadine responded that everyone else could understand him just fine and he was keeping his teeth in his pocket until he needed them for eating.Matt was overseeing the branding of the cattle, preparatory to the drive, and having the men turn loose any cows belonging to a rancher named Meeker (Davison Clark), or to Don Diego. Tom rides up and orders that no cattle be turned loose and that they all be branded with the D-Double Bar brand (his). Matt doesnt agree, but tells the men to go ahead and do as Tom says.About that time, Mr. Meeker rides up with some of his men, including a hired gun, and asks Tom for permission to look through the herd to cull out any of his cows. Tom denies permission, telling Meeker that hes branding all of the cows he has, regardless of any other brands they may already have on them.Things get pretty testy and Matt and Mr. Meekers gunfighter, Cherry Valance (John Ireland) exchange words. Matt has become very handy with a gun himself. Tom relents somewhat, in that he decides to offer Meeker $2/head for any of his cows that make it to Missouri and get sold. Meeker agrees. Cherry then decides hed like to work for Tom instead of Meeker and asks to be hired on. Tom hires him at $10/month, the going rate for a trail hand.Matt and Cherry are just itching to have a fight (preferably a gunfight), and Tom realizes its probably inevitable, but he forces them to get along for the time being. They do have an initial challenge contest, where they borrow each others guns and alternately shoot at a tin can, impressing each other with their respective skills.In the bunkhouse, theres a poker game the night before the drive starts. Quo (Chief Yowlachie) is sitting opposite Groot. Groot has a good hand, but when Quo bets one silver dollar, Groot is aghast. Thats equivalent to 3 days pay. He asks Matt to loan him a dollar, but Matt refuses. The rule of the game is that only whats on the table at the time can be used to bet with. So, Quo asks Groot whats in the small bag he has there on the table and Groot tells him it contains his false teeth. Quo says hell accept half interest in the teeth to cover the one dollar bet. Groot isn't happy about it, but he agrees. They show their cards. Quo has the better hand and demands the teeth. Groot wants to know how hes supposed to eat without his teeth and Quo tells him that come grub time, you get em.Dunson comes into the bunkhouse and tells everyone that its now or never as far as their decisions to go on the drive. He tells them that there will be no hard feelings for anyone who wants to stay behind, and promised them that theyd still have jobs on the ranch after the drive is over. He tells them that theyll be doing good to make 10 miles a day on the 1,000 mile drive, 15 miles if they are lucky. Theyll face bad weather, dust, Indians and border gangs (once they get close to Missouri). But, once a cowboy says hell go, hes expected to finish the drive, whatever happens. Dunson makes everyone going sign a piece of paper representing their word to stick it out.The next morning, breakfast was served at 4:30 and, with nearly 10,000 head of cattle grouped together, at 5 a.m., Dunson quietly told Matt to take 'em to Missouri. All the cowboys whooped and hollered as they started out.Quo holds Groot to the results of their bet, only loaning the false teeth back to Groot at mealtimes. Groot is not happy about that. He tells Quo that the teeth help him keep the dust out of his mouth. Quo tells him to keep his mouth shut then, and dust not get in. Groot complains that before the drive is over, hell probably eat enough land to get himself incorporated in the Union as the State of Groot. Quo still says no. Dunson isnt happy about the situation either, complaining that Groot mumbles and needs to have his teeth in to be understood.The men start talking about taking the cattle to Kansas instead of Missouri, as its closer and there are less hazards along the way. However, because no one has personal knowledge of a railway actually being in Abilene, KS (where rumor has it there was one), Dunson says to forget it.Dunson goes through 3-4 horses a day, so hes obviously very involved in the drive.The group is 30 days into the drive with no major issues. One cowboy remarks that he doesnt like that. It makes him nervous. He prefers a balance of things going well and having trouble, not just one or the other. The trouble part does come, and it starts as a result of Bunk Kenneally (Ivan Parry) continuing to get into the supply of sugar (he dips his fingers into the sack whenever he can, which gets him in trouble with Groot). Everyone has been on their best behavior as far as being quiet, because the cattle are on edge. They are tired and there are coyotes milling about. Everyone is worried that the cows will stampede if something spooks them. So, when Bunk clumsily knocks over some of the cook pots as hes getting into the sugar, thats enough noise to start a stampede.One of the cowboys prefers to wear a bowler hat. He gets trapped behind a shrub in the middle of the stampede, so Matt and another fellow ride up and each grab an arm of this fellow and they carry him off to the side of the stampeding cows and let him down.After the cows are stopped and calmed down, it's noticed that one of the wranglers, Dan Latimer (Harry Carey Jr.) is missing. Latimer wore checkered pants and would talk about using the $100 he would be earning on the drive to buy a place to farm/ranch, and a pair of red shoes for his wife.A search begins and they find what's left of Latimer's distinctive checkered pants among a bunch of dead cattle. Dunson tells Matt to make sure the widow gets Dans money and whatever else. Matt replies, like a pair of red shoes?Dunson reads over Latimer's remains the next morning and as he puts the Bible back on the wagon, he goes over and picks up Groots' whip, at the same time calling out to Bunk: Bunk Kennally, you started all this! 400 cows dead and Latimer too. Stealing sugar like a little kid. Well, we whip kids to punish them for things like that.Dunson tells Teeler to strap Bunk to a wagon wheel. Before Teeler can do that, Bunk speaks up and acknowledges that he is remorseful about Latimer and the dead cows, but he tells Dunson he wont stand to be whipped. As he goes for his gun, hed likely have been shot dead by Dunson, but Matt draws first and shoots Bunk in the shoulder, saving his life. Dunson turns to Matt and says, you shot him, you take care of him!Matt provides Bunk with two horses and sends him back home. Cherry observes all this and tells Matt that while hes real fast with a gun, hes got a soft heart, and that will get him hurt some day. Matt says that could be, but not to count on it.40 days out, with reduced rations (after one wagon was destroyed in the stampede), the men become increasingly restless. Tom reminds them that they all signed on to see it through, like it or not.A cowboy named Sutter (William Self) rides up, his head bandaged and barely able to talk (there was a rope burn around his neck), saying he had been riding with the Garwood herd (2,000 cows) when they were ambushed by about 100 bandits. Hearing that, Naylor, Fernandez and another hand tell Dunson theyve had enough (but not until right after theyd watched Dunson set his gun belt down as he was preparing to go get some water). Dunson tells them they cant go. They reach for their guns as Groot tosses a loaded and cocked rifle to Dunson. Dunson's shots, in combination with those fired by Matt and Cherry, kill the three wranglers.Dunson orders the three buried, announcing that hell read over them in the morning. That prompts one of the cowboys to say: Plantin and readin, plantin and readin. Why, when youve killed a man, why try to read the Lord in as a partner in the job?Matt argues with Dunson over the need to confront and kill the three men. He and Groot both tell Dunson hes wrong to do such things. Groot then patches up a bullet wound on Dunsons lower left leg.That night, Teeler, Kelsey and Laredo are on watch, when they decide to take some ammunition and flour and ride out, headed back home. The next morning, Dunson sends Cherry and Buster to go get the three and bring them back, dead or alive.The herd arrives at the Red River. Matt wants to give everyone a rest and cross the river first thing in the morning. Dunson will have none of that, and orders the crossing to begin immediately. He finds a couple areas of quicksand in the river to be avoided then orders the crossing to start. The process continues into the night. Between 30-40 head are lost during the process.Dunson is limping badly and pulls heavily from a bottle of whiskey once he sits down to rest. Hes exhausted, refusing to sleep until Cherry gets back with the three cowboys who left. He wants to make sure no one else tries to leave. Hes sure once the three are returned and punished, no one else will leave.Cherry does come back, on the 4th day after he left, with two of the cowboys: Laredo and Teeler. Cherry said Kelsey chose not to return, so he had to shoot him. Dunson announces that he is going to hang the two. Matt tells him that he wont be doing that, and he will be the one to stop him. Dunson braces his right hand on a piece of wood to stand up and face Matt, but Matt shoots him in the hand. When Dunson tries to draw his gun, he isn't able to hold onto it and it falls to the ground. Dunson reaches down for it with his left hand and Buster shoots the gun away.Matt announces that hes taking over and will be taking the herd to Abilene. He says that Dunson will be left behind. Groot offers to stay with Dunson, but he tells Groot to go with the others. He then tells Matt that hell come after him and will kill him.Groot is later calculating how long before Dunson gets to another town, rounds up some new men, and catches up to them. For the next 2-3 weeks, everyone on the drive is nervous and jumpy, anticipating his return.One of the steers is found dead, filled with Apache arrows. Matt sends Buster and Cherry ahead 10 miles with rifles to scout and keep watch. Buster comes riding back all excited, with news that theres a wagon train about 18 miles ahead, the Donegal party, headed from New Orleans to Nevada, to set up a saloon for gambling, drinking and partying. He says there are dancing girls with the wagon train. Matt decides that the men need and deserve some distraction and decides to head the herd to the wagon train before continuing on to Abilene.As the herd approaches the wagon train, they hear shooting. The train is under attack by Apaches. Matt gives orders for the men to split into two groups and come at the Indians from the sides, while he and a few others ride down the middle. It takes some time to get all the men rounded up and ready, so Matt and the few others go ahead and ride straight to the wagons, jumping right into the middle of the circled wagons and helping fight the Indians who were circling around, yelping and shooting their arrows.Matt finds himself side by side with a very attractive woman who is firing a rifle (but not very well). Shes Tess Millay (Joanne Dru). He tells her to load and hell shoot. She perceives that hes angry about something and wants to know what. About that time, she takes an arrow to the right shoulder, pinning her to a wagon. Matt cuts the shaft so she is free from the wagon, but he has to finish the Indian fight before helping more. The rest of the men finally come charging down the hill and the men within the circle of wagons come charging out and the Apaches decide to hightail it.Matt returns to pull the arrow from Tesss shoulder, then he decides he needs to suck some poison out of the wound. She slaps him across the face for doing that, then passes out.Theres a big party that night, making use of the food, drinks, cards, and girls that are all available in the camp. Tess asks Groot to tell her all about Matt, because she needs to know. She also wants to talk to Matt before they get back on the trail the next day. Groot goes and finds Matt (hes out in the evening fog, on watch) and tells Tess where he is. She goes out there and gets up close and starts talking to him. She tells him that he needs to talk to her, that talking about his concerns and fears is the way to deal with them.Matt doesnt need all that much convincing to talk, as she's a very soft and pretty girl that is very close to him. He opens up and they quickly get very comfortable with each other. Shed fallen in love with him immediately. He probably did too, but needed a bit of convincing that it would be ok to fall in love with a saloon girl.As its raining hard and there are worries about the level of the next river to be crossed. Matt decides they need to do it right away, even though its nighttime.Meanwhile, Dunson has gathered 8 new men and is on the chase. Nine days after the herd had left the wagon train, Dunson and his men come across the wagons. Tess immediately announces that shell take care of Mr. Dunson. She considers shooting Dunson, as he sits in her tent talking to her, but he knows she has a pistol and is prepared to shoot her first if need be. It doesnt come to that. He notices shes wearing his mothers bracelet and asks her how she got it away from Matt. She sarcastically says she stole it, then admits she loves Matt and that he gave it to her.As they talk, Tess tells Dunson that she wanted to go with Matt on the drive, but he said no, it was too dangerous and tough. That reminded Dunson of the day when he turned down his womans request to go along with him. He was nevertheless bound and determined to go find and kill Matt, and tells Tess she cant say or do anything to change his mind. She keeps after him, though, and he acknowledges his disappointment in Matt, saying he was the son he never had and would stand to inherit his ranch if he hadnt betrayed him.Dunson takes a fresh look at Tess and offers her half of everything he owns in exchange for her bearing him a son. She says shell do it, if hell stop pursuing Matt. He says no, so she begs instead to be allowed to go with him. He says ok.Matts understandably stressed about whether they will find a railroad in Abilene, and the fact that Dunson is hot on his trail. Fortunately, they hear a train whistle in the distance and come across a train, about 12 miles from Abilene. The engineer is very thrilled to see the herd, as are the townspeople who come riding out to meet and greet them. They tell Matt to drive the herd right down Main Street so all the people can see (thats nearly impossible not to do anyway, as its a tiny town).Its August 14, 1865 and marks the time the first cattle drive on the Chisholm Trail is completed.In Abilene, Mr. Melville (Harry Carey Sr.) represents the Greenwood Trading Company of Illinois and offers immediately to buy the entire herd. Matt has no experience at selling cows, so hes hesitant to accept the $20/head offer. Mr. Melville then tells him to go out and find the best price he can for a lot of 500 cows and then hed match the price and still buy the whole herd. It ends up being $21/head. Matt signs the contract and receives a check for $50,000, with the balance to be paid once a final tally is arrived at. He makes sure all the cowboys get paid right away.Matt returns to his room at the Hotel Royale and is shocked to find Tess in there, all dressed in black. She apologizes for appearing as if shes in mourning. She tells him Dunson is camped outside town and will be coming to get him in the morning. It's likely that they get to know each other intimately that night.The next morning, everyone has gathered at the front of the hotel, waiting. Buster rushes in through the cows on his horse to announce that Dunson and his 10-12 men were riding in. Dunson, meanwhile, is telling his men to remember where they each stand in all this, which apparently is to hang well back and not interfere. Dunson dismounts on the far side of the railroad tracks and sets out with a very purposeful walk, through the cows and across the tracks.Cherry, realizing that Matt is not likely to draw and shoot it out with Dunson, confronts Dunson before he gets to Matt. They both draw and shoot, wounding each other. Cherry falls, but Dunson continues on. He gets close and tells Matt to draw, but Matt refuses. Dunson draws and empties his gun, shooting all around Matt, knocking his hat off and grazing his right cheek, drawing blood. He then walks up to Matt and wants to know what he has to do to make a man out of him.Dunson grabs and tosses away Matts gun. He reminds Matt that as a boy, he once told him never to try that again, but Matt doesn't react. Dunson then punches Matt in the face 2-3 times, knocking him down. He drags him back up, ready to hit some more, but Matt shocks him by punching him and knocking him down. They brawl until Tess fires a pistol into the air, stopping the action. She chews them out loudly for awhile, then decides maybe they should go ahead and pummel each other, and she turns away so they can continue.They don't start fighting again, however. Instead, they stand looking after Tess. Dunson tells Matt to marry that gal. Matt says, When are you going to stop telling people what to do? Dunson says, After one more thing. After we get back to Texas, Im going to make the brand the double bar D, with an additional name (he scrawls out an M in the dirt). You earned it!

title: Warlock
synopsis: The scene opens in early colonial America, in Boston, Massachusetts in 1691. A combination gallows/pyre has been constructed for an execution by both hanging and burning, and a man is shown roughly loading feral cats into a wicker basket. Village elders are entering a small tower being used as a prison; its door engraved with a hex mark. At the top of the tower, a man (Julian Sands) is chained, including a peculiar shackle that locks his thumbs to his big toes. The man is to be executed for 'trafficking with the Devil,' and is being offered a final chance to confess his sins before man and God. However, the warlock is completely unrepentant and does not speak to the jailer or elders. The elders leave to continue preparing for the execution.Entering the cell next is a stoic man named Giles Redferne (Richard E. Grant), a witch hunter who helped capture the warlock. He gloats over the warlock's meeting a well-deserved fate, asking whether Satan would have saved the warlock yet, if he wanted to at all. The warlock slyly suggests that Satan may yet save them both. Giles kicks him in the face, knocking him onto his back and says he'll watch the warlock die tomorrow. The warlock tells him to believe it on seeing it... tomorrow.As Giles leaves, he warns the jailer that the thumb locks must not be removed from the warlock even during or after the execution; not until his corpse has completely finished burning to ash. But even as he speaks, there are sounds of a storm brewing. As Giles exits the tower, a powerful, clearly unnatural storm breaks over the village, and Giles notes it is centered over the warlock's prison tower. Giles rushes into the cell to find the warlock free of his shackles and channeling a powerful spell. The warlock disappears into the storm with Giles following behind him.Cut to modern day Los Angeles, California. We hear a radio broadcast about a storm breaking; one nicknamed, 'The Devil's Wind.' A funnel of air is seen heading toward a suburban house. A blonde woman, Kassandra (Lori Singer) is turning over in her bed, asleep until the sound of a breaking window jolts her awake. She goes to investigate, quickly joined by Chas (Kevin O'Brien), the owner of the house, from whom she rents her room. They find the warlock lying unconscious on the floor of the living room.Chas goes to call the police to get an ambulance, but the winds have knocked down phone lines throughout the area. He and Kassandra half-pull, half-carry him to Kassandra's room. Kassandra is wary but Chas wants to show the strange arrival some compassion.Morning arrives and Kassandra is dressing and preparing for work. She is a diabetic and must take regular injections of insulin.Going back to her room, she sees the warlock is awake and slyly suggests he stop drinking. As she asks if there's someone he can call, as the phones are working again, the warlock is staring in amazement at a weekly newspaper on her desk, dated March 4-10, 1988. He asks if that could truly be the year, though it appears he is talking to himself as much as Kassandra. She is amused at his voice inflections, noting he speaks, English English. She gently presses him back down on the bed and tells him to rest. On the road, driving to work, Kassandra is shown to be both a bit careless in her driving, not always watching the road, and a bit vain, praying she never gets old.Back at the house, Chas is cooking a meal. Picking up a knife he's dropped, he's briefly started on seeing the warlock's reflection. The warlock just smiles politely and stands silently in the kitchen while Chas talks to him. He notices the warlock looking at a ring on his finger, and says it's his birth sign,Scorpio, but nobody believes in astrology anymore, which surprises the warlock. Suddenly the warlock grabs a knife and hacks Chas's finger off, taking the ring. Chas screams for help, but the warlock gestures and the kitchen door closes, trapping Chas in the kitchen. Donning the ring, the warlock grabs Chas and bites his tongue out, spitting it into the skillet.Kassandra is seen at work as a waitress at a small coffee shop. A police cruiser arrives in front. A police detective asks Kassandra questions about Chas, telling her the coroner's notes on the cause of his death. He asks Kassandra for the names of Chas's lovers. Kassandra tells the detective that Chas was gay.Over at a bookstore selling books on the metaphysical, a group is leaving after conversation with a spirit, happy at the results of the spirit channeling. The Channeler (Mary Woronov) starts to close up when she sees the warlock in the shop. He asks her to channel a spirit for him. She is allured at his charismatic nature and agrees to his request.The Channeler begins the private channeling for the spirit that the warlock said had many names, one of which was Zamiel. As the Channeler completes the summoning, the warlock immediately sees through the ritual and notes that she is a fraud. But he only says that he wishes to wait for the true Zamiel to appear. Trying to keep up the charade, the Channeler says the warlock must cast aside his skepticism. But suddenly she begins to gasp and choke. Her hands almost involuntarily close around a crystal, and it shatters. Her head falls forward onto the table, and then snaps back up, and her face has become demonic; her teeth huge and like shark's teeth. The warlock asks why he was brought to this place and time. Zamiel, speaking through the Channeler, tells the warlock to bring together his Bible, which has been divided into three parts. The warlock is amazed to hear that this book, which he calls the Grand Grimoire, is here, now. Very interested, he asks what reward was in store for him if he succeeded in retaking the book - which he understands, can thwart Creation itself. Zamiel tells the warlock that if he succeeds, he shall become Satan's one begotten son. His eyes will guide the warlock. The Channeler then collapses face-first back onto the table. The warlock picks up a shard from the crystal and lifts the Channeler's head back up. She is dead and her face has reverted to normal. The warlock uses the sharp edge of the broken crystal shard to remove her eyes, and they are shown to be moving - a guide for the warlock.Kassandra arrives home, not quite comfortable in the house now that Chas has been murdered. She closes a door, and a shadow appears from a sliver of light behind it as she walks away. Going to her room, Kassandra starts to gather her things, deciding to leave the house. The sound of shattering glass attracts her attention.Going to investigate, she sees a cat run across the hall. Relieved, she resumes packing, but then sees Giles Redferne in the doorway. She screams in fear, and he rushes to cover her mouth, holding up the thumb-lock device, demanding to know if the one who wore these bled at all, anywhere. She screams again and he slaps her face. She tries to punch him, but he grabs her and drags her to the kitchen where a police chalk outline still shows where Chas was found. Giles tells Kassandra that he can find 'the beast' if he knows if his blood was spilled. Kassandra finally realizes that Giles is talking about the warlock and finally admits that he had been cut. Giles asks her to show him where. Kassandra goes to the vacuum cleaner and empties out the dust bag. Sifting through the dust, Giles finds a shard of broken glass with blood on it. He fiddles with it, using his dagger, saying it may do. He scrapes the dried blood from the shard into a small glass vial.While he works, Kassandra sneaks into the next room and calls the police. She tells them there is an intruder, and she doesn't know what to make of him, but he has a thing for blood-- draw your own conclusions. The operator traces her call and gets her address and tells her a car is on the way. Kassandra says she's fleeing the house, though she doesn't get far after hanging up before Giles grabs her, now wanting to know where her water well is. Amused despite her fear, at the man asking for a water well, she takes him to the bathroom and shows him how to use the sink. He puts a little bit of water into the vial with the blood. She watches, perplexed, as he sets up a strange device. At her query, he explains it is a witch compass and she understands that he is hunting the blond man who had been in the house, and Giles says that this man was a warlock. He puts a drop of the blood onto the compass, saying that the compass will point in the warlock's direction. Kassandra watches, now interested, but mocks Giles when the device doesn't appear to work. Giles tells her to give it time, as the blood was thin, but Kassandra hears the arrival of the police squad car and tells him that he doesn't have any time. Giles rushes to the door and is taken aback at the automobiles, something he's seeing for the first time and has no idea what they are. He goes outside, not understanding who the officers are. The police order him to freeze. Thinking he is being attacked, Giles uses his whip to try and defend himself, but an officer subdues him with a taser gun.Giles spouts about the warlock's evil as he is loaded into the squad car. The lead officer tells Kassandra they'll take him down to the station, and advises her to leave the house. Kassandra is very agreeable to this and rushes to resume packing her things.Hurrying between the house and her car, stuffing as much as will fit into the car, Kassandra grabs some things from the bathroom. But the needle of Giles' witch compass, still resting on the bathroom counter top, suddenly begins to move, and she notices. Approaching the door, Kassandra freezes in fear on spotting the warlock just outside, holding a pair of disembodied eyes in one hand-- eyes that seem to move on their own. She rushes to close and lock the door, and rushes back to her phone to call the police again. This time however she only reaches the automated hold system. She sees the witch compass needle begin to spin and drops the phone in fear. She rushes to secure all the doors and windows of the house, but she is too late as the warlock is behind her.The warlock drags her by her hair into the living room, watching the disembodied eyes in his other hand. They lead him to an antique coffee table, and he sweeps everything off of it. Kassandra runs to the bathroom and locks herself inside as the warlock smashes the table apart, finding a sheaf of papers inside which are covered in strange writing and drawings. Inside the bathroom, Kassandra tries to open the shutters and escape through the window. Suddenly the warlock's hand smashes through and grabs her wrist. Screaming in terror, Kassandra yanks her wrist free and loses her balance, falling to the floor and hitting her head, knocking herself out. The warlock had managed to grab the charm bracelet off of her wrist. Holding it, he sticks his head through the window and recites a dire chant before leaving.Morning comes before Kassandra comes to. Struggling to regain her bearings, she realizes that her hair has grown far far longer than she keeps it cut. Rushing to look at herself in the mirror, she finds to her horror that she looks about twenty years older.Kassandra is leaving the police station with Giles, having bailed him out of jail. She realizes that the warlock put a spell on her to age her from twenty years old to forty, and she needs Giles' help as he seems to know a great deal about the warlock. Driving down the street, Giles is completely dumbfounded at the world around him. He explains to Kassandra that he and the warlock are from the year 1691 and a time portal brought them 300 years into the future without explanation.Back at the house, Giles is examining the broken table. Kassandra stops him and asks how they fix her age. He asks if the warlock took a small, personal object from her, and she remembers that he took her charm bracelet. Giles says the only way to break the hex is to regain the bracelet from the warlock. Kassandra is too frightened to pursue the warlock and tells him he must go on his own. Giles warns her that the spell placed on her is not complete, but progressive. Each day she will age another 20 years - meaning within two days, three at most, she will die of old age.Kassandra and Giles are preparing to pursue the warlock, though Kassandra makes it clear that she's only looking to reclaim her bracelet - whatever quarrel Giles has with the warlock, as far as she is concerned, is between them and none of her business. Giles nods curtly and they start off.As the warlock walks across the mesa, studying the papers he took from the broken table, Giles is busying himself coating his whip with salt taken from the house. He explains to Kassandra that salt is taboo to witches. Again we see Kassandra's careless driving style as Giles must grab the wheel to steer the car away from the wrong side of the road - and away from an onrushing truck.A young boy is playing with a football in a small trailer park. He throws it and is surprised to see a man catch the football - the warlock. The boy takes the warlock to the nearby playground, and shows him how to play a hand-held football video game. The warlock is distracted by the sound of singing and music. The boy explains that it's coming from the church a few dozen yards behind them. The warlock asks the boy why he's not at church, and he tells the warlock that he never goes to church, because his dad hates all things about Jesus Christ and the 12 Apostrophes. The boy then asks the warlock why he doesn't attend church, and the warlock says that witches cannot set foot on church grounds. The boy thought witches were girls, but the warlock tells him that some are men. The boy asks where the warlock's flying broomstick is. The warlock says he needs no broomstick to fly. When asked what he does need, the warlock just laughs and gently pushes the swing that the boy is sitting on.Kassandra pulls into a roadside gas station to refill her gas tank. Giles sets up the witch compass while the car is being refilled and notes the needle moving in the direction of the park. Gunshots are heard, and the station attendant explains that local residents are hunting coyote, because a small boy in the nearby trailer park was killed by one. The attendant says that coyotes are known to do that in this part of the state, and the boy was badly chewed up, his skin taken clean off.Kassandra and Giles head to the trailer park where they see the hunters dropping the corpse of a coyote they'd killed on the ground. A small crowd is gathered, murmuring. Giles notices one woman's reaction, and her face as she walks away. He rushes after her, asking if she is the boy's mother. When she acknowledges that she is, he offers her his sympathy, and asks if he was baptized. She's shocked that he asked her that question, but she responds: No, his father wouldn't allow it. and walks away. Giles' face turns very grimGiles suspects the warlock is the boy's murderer, and he explains to Kassandra that of all the various spell reagents used by witches, the most precious is human fat - and if that fat is cut from a male child that has not been baptized, there is one thing it would be used for: a flying potion.At night, Giles' grim words prove true, as the warlock cooks the fat in a small metal can over a flame that burns blue. After he drinks the foul-tasting brew, a police officer on speeding stakeout is dumbfounded at the sight of a strange man flying through the air at incredible speed.Kassandra is trying to make small talk with Giles to pass the time as they travel down the road. She is startled by his sudden question on why she paints her face. She tries to explain that in modern times, makeup is considered perfectly acceptable. Giles blurts out that if: My Marion had- and suddenly stops, saying only that in the 17th century, women didn't wear make-up unless they practiced witchcraft. Kassandra realizes that Giles had accidentally let slip something he didn't want to talk about - he was married. She tries to press for more information when Giles insists they stop the car so he can get new bearings via the compass. Kassandra chastises herself as Giles sets the compass up on the road... and then realizes she is feeling very ill. Giles notices her stumbling out of the car, and she begs him to leave her by the road and go on without her. Her voice has changed drastically. Midnight has passed, and Kassandra has aged to sixty years old. Giles can only comfort her.Morning comes, and the warlock has secreted himself in the attic of a farmhouse. He is studying the papers, and is pleased at his new-found ability to create and control witch-fire. Even hidden, however, the warlock's very presence alters the environment around him - the farmer's father goes to tell him that the cream has gone bad, which puzzles the farmer as he only brought it in yesterday. He asks his father to bring out one of the horses, and the father finds the horse deeply agitated, and wet. Walking toward the house, he notices the attic's door onto the roof is ajar. Watching his young grandchildren run by, racing each other, the elderly man takes paint and a paintbrush, and begins painting something on the barn.Kassandra and Redferne are passing the state border into Colorado. Kassandra finally gets Giles to tell her about Marion. She realizes that this is why he is pursuing the warlock - he killed his wife.They are passing by the farm and Giles is shocked to see a hex mark painted on the side of the barn, and the witch compass needle moves to point toward it. Giles urges Kassandra to stop and begins running toward the farm. The witch compass is broken by the hard stop, but Giles says that if God is with them, they won't need it any longer.They rush into the house and confront the farmer, who was the son an Amish man and a Mennonite, saying that they are bewitched. The farmer is startled and wary at the intrusion until his father comes into the room, saying he painted the mark, and they are bewitched. He and Giles shake hands in a comradely fashion, and he takes Giles to show him the ajar attic door. Giles has the Mennonite retrieve nails and a hammer, which he uses to nail the door shut. Back in the house, the farmer and his wife are still amazed at how his father is giving Giles almost free run on the property. Giles says that if children are present, to take them away. The Mennonite agrees and urges his son and daughter-in-law to take the kids and go. A horse that sweats in the morning, cream that sours overnight-- even his son, a modern-day farmer, has learned the signs that the Mennonite recognizes and believes in.The farmer and his wife take the kids and drive off. Giles is preparing to enter the attic from the retractable staircase connecting it to the farmhouse's hallway. He gives Kassandra and the Mennonite copper pennies to hold between their lips, as a ward against errant magic. On his word they are to close the steps and brace the door shut, and not re-open it until he says it is okay.Pulling his whip and bodkin knife, Giles enters the attic. He's startled by a flying bat and quickly slays it. Noting a small window braced open, he knows the warlock was - or still is there. Looking around, he finds a broken piece of furniture, and a piece of paper inside, covered with drawings and writing. He quietly reads a few words from the paper, then tears it in half and puts the pieces on the floor. As the two pieces begin to move toward each other and reform into a single full sheet, Giles realizes with horror that it is a page from the Grand Grimoire. He rushes to the stairs to tell Kassandra and the Mennonite about it-- the Grand Grimoire, an indestructible book of black magic said to be authored by Satan himself-- his bible. The Grimoire was last held by the West End church in Boston. Giles had urged them to divide the book into three parts to prevent witches from seizing it and gaining access to all of its secrets, but the pages were supposed to be kept on hallowed ground. Kassandra interrupts him, asking where the warlock is. Giles says, exasperated, that he's fled. But Kassandra points out that if the Grimoire was so precious to witches, why would he leave even a single page behind? Realizing Kassandra's point, he shouts for them to close the steps.Giles rushes back into the center of the attic, ready for battle, when the warlock lands to confront him. Giles shouts for the Mennonite to fix the brace, which the warlock scoffs at, pointing out he can now fly. Giles promptly uncoils his whip, yanking out the small brace in the window to close it. He then advances on the warlock and jams his bodkin deep into the warlock's middle. But he finds to his dismay that the warlock had placed the Grimoire pages under his shirt, and they acted as armor; the deep tear in the pages mending instantaneously. The warlock marvels at how even just two-thirds of the Grimoire could do this. He then counterattacks with a bolt of witch fire, causing Gilles to bust through the nailed attic door and tumble out onto the ground. Retrieving the page left behind, the warlock steps out onto the roof and with his magic, causes the weather vane to break loose from the roof and hurtle at Giles like a spear. It narrowly misses, and Giles coils his whip around the warlock's ankle as he starts to fly off. The warlock drags him across the farm and flies into the barn, where Giles collides with the barn wall and loses his grip. Kassandra and the Mennonite regroup with him, having retrieved the weather vane, which Giles holds ready. When the warlock re-emerges, Giles hurls it like a javelin, nailing the warlock in the back and forcing him to land. The three pounce on him, pull his boots off and hold him down, where Giles scrambles to affix the thumb-toe locks. Kassandra scrambles to recover her bracelet, but finds only the Channeler's eyes, which she tosses away in disgust. The warlock finds his avenue of escape - he stares into the Mennonite's eyes. Giles notices, but too late - the warlock has placed a vile hex that is causing the Mennonite's eyes to bleed. Feeling the warlock has slain too many, he lets go of him to tend to the stricken Mennonite. The warlock is able to hobble and hop away, the locks not completely in place.Giles calls for brass keys to remove the hex. He also gives Kassandra the hammer and remaining nails, saying that if she finds footprints from the warlock, to hammer the nails into the ground there. Kassandra is furiously angry at the thought of facing the warlock with a simple nail, but Giles insists she go and do as he says - the warlock can be crippled that way.Kassandra heads off, finding her way to a railway station near the farmhouse. She discovers foot prints made from a bare foot and hammers the nails into the dirt. She hears the warlock scream in agony, and we see him holding his feet as he hides in a railway car. Kassandra drives a nail into another foot print, but this time there is no scream-- the warlock had ripped a plank up from the railway car and is holding it against his feet like a shield. But then Kassandra finds an indentation made in a small pile of dirt, by the warlock's head when he stumbled and fell while removing the thumb-lock device. She drives a nail in and the warlock falls unconscious. His arm dangles limply out of the car and Kassandra sees her charm bracelet around the warlock's wrist. But the railway car begins moving, and Kassandra's supernaturally-aged, sixty-year-old body struggles desperately to catch up. She finally manages to grab the warlock's wrist, but the warlock comes to and grabs her wrist in return. She hits his hand with the hammer, causing him to lose his grip and her to fall to the ground. She watches in dismay as the train carries the warlock off... but then notes that the hammer pulled her charm bracelet off the warlock's wrist, and both hammer and bracelet lie on the ground just a few feet in front of her.Giles has finished treating the Mennonite's eyes and covered them with a dressing. He has placed the brass keys above his head, to be spun clockwise once per hour. By morning the hex would be gone and his eyes recovered. He hears Kassandra ask about the Mennonite. Only her silhouette is visible from the darkened entrance to the bedroom. Giles offers no excuse other than his wish to save just one life that the warlock would have otherwise taken. Saying she understands, Kassandra steps into the light, showing that the hex on her is likewise broken and her body has been restored to its original youth at twenty years of age.They are heading back to Kassandra's car, Giles saying that it is easy enough to gather brass, copper and glass to rebuild the compass. The most important thing is the weather vane, which has a new supply of the warlock's blood. But Kassandra wants no further part of the witch hunt now that she is restored to normal. She hands Giles her car keys and credit card, wishing him well. He grabs her and she protests that the deal was only until she got her bracelet back. Having never learned Kassandra's name, he asks her for it, and proceeds to tell her that her life is still in grievous danger - in fact all life is, now that he knows what the warlock is up to. The warlock has recovered two portions of the Grand Grimoire. If he gains the third part and completes the book, he will gain access to its ultimate secret-- the lost, true name of God. This true name was invoked during Creation... and witches claim that if the true name of God were to be pronounced in reverse, and spoken backward, all of Creation would also reverse - Earth and the universe would be destroyed. Kassandra groans in dismay. She is terrified of the warlock, and it shows plainly. On the next confrontation, there would be no spells or hexes-- she is sure that next time, the warlock would kill her. Giles promises to protect her as he holds out the car keys.Driving down the road again, Kassandra has come up with a plan. The Grimoire was last kept by the West End Church in Boston. Instead of playing tag, as she explains to Giles, they should play leap frog instead - hurry to get to Boston before the warlock and make sure the last pages are safe on hallowed ground. They drive to the airport and Kassandra calls Operator Assistance to get the West End Church's address. Kassandra gives the ticket agent her credit card, but when the agent is distracted by another customer asking a quick question, Kassandra stealthily unplugs the card reader.Noticing that the plane Kassandra speaks of is able to fly through the air like a bird, Giles is very nervous, thinking that flying machines were a form of witchcraft. Kassandra suddenly notices Giles still has the weather vane attached to his back. She tries to grab it away, arguing he wouldn't be allowed on the plane with it. But suddenly she sees the warlock in the airport-- the warlock was no fool, and had figured out how to beat them at their own game. She shoves the vane back into Giles' hands and drags him off to the plane. On board, during the evening, Kassandra tries to get Giles to settle down and sleep. But he notices another passenger putting cream in his coffee and noticing it is spoiled, and another passenger lighting a cigarette with a cigarette lighter, and the flame is pure blue. Giles believes these are signs of a witch's presence. Kassandra tries to calm him, and he realizes that she saw the warlock in the airport and didn't tell him. He insists they look for the warlock on the plane, but the warlock has secreted himself in the baggage hold in the plane's underside, out of sight.The plane lands in Boston. Airport agents open the baggage hold door and are startled at what looks like a man flying out. Cut to Kassandra and Giles in a taxicab, hoping to find the church. Boston has changed considerably in the last 300 years and Giles isn't sure the church's location is still the same, or if it even exists anymore. Recalling his knowledge of certain landmarks as best he can, Giles manages to aid the cab driver in finding the correct church. They arrive just as the Pastor of the Church is closing up. The Pastor is looking to get home, but when Giles says he needs to speak about the Grand Grimoire, he re-opens the doors and brings them inside.The Pastor says that Church documents aren't for sale, thinking that they are collectors of old documents. Kassandra says that they just need to find the book. The Pastor says it is long gone, divided up and-- he is interrupted by wind blowing the doors open, which alerts Giles that thw warlock is around. Closing the doors again, the Pastor inquires into their interest in the Grimoire, and is shocked at Giles' explanation.He retrieves and opens an old folder of Church papers going back to 1692 and detailing the separation of the Grand Grimoire. One part was placed within the hollow of a table used in taking communion. The second part was given to a vicar who had founded a ministry west of the Carolinas, placed within an armoire. Over the years and centuries as witchcraft was forgotten and people no longer believed in it, these objects ended up sold and donated, re-sold and re-donated, until the table ended up at Chas's house, and the armoire in the Mennonite's attic. As for the third part... the Pastor says it should still be in Boston.Kassandra and Giles are walking down the road. The last part of the book is in an old graveyard that Giles remembers existing even back in his day. The layout of the town is very different, but some subtle similarities remain. He manages to locate the graveyard, saying that if the ground there is consecrated, then the pages are safe, for the warlock can never set foot there.Meanwhile, the Pastor is back home. His wife alerts him to a sound she's heard. They both note that the door is rattling and shaking-- in fact the whole house is shaking. The crucifix falls off the wall. Finally the bolts in the door's hinges slip out. The rumbling stops and the warlock pushes the door open from the hinged side. He forces the Pastor and his wife into chairs. With only a touch to the wife's breast he sees that she is pregnant with twins. The warlock's request is simple: knowledge of what the Pastor discussed with Giles and Kassandra, in exchange for the unborn children's lives.Kassandra and Giles make it to the cemetery. Giles jabs the weather vane into the ground, and it starts to shake from the warlock's blood which is still on the sharp barb at the vane's top-- a sign that the ground is consecrated and the warlock cannot tread on it. Still, he needs to know the pages are there, and therefore protected. The Pastor had told Giles to look for a grave with a hex mark which will show where the final part of the Grimoire is buried. Kassandra finds the marked grave, but covers the inscription with her arms and tries to stop Giles from looking. Suspicious, he pushes her away, and stops in sick horror on finding his own name - Giles Redferne - inscribed on the tombstone.Kassandra is following Giles out when she notices several empty grave lots and signs of digging and construction. She follows it to a sign partially obscured by bushes. She pushes them aside and sees it is a notice about the cemetery being remodeled and graves being moved as part of a project to modify the cemetery's layout in order to accommodate a building project for new condominiums. Alarmed, she tells Giles about the sign and explains that maybe the remodeling projects means that Giles' grave was relocated as well... and that the ground there is not part of the original cemetery, and therefore not hallowed.Kassandra uses the weather vane as a gauge... and finds that the ground where Giles' grave has been moved to, is indeed not consecrated... meaning the warlock can go there and open the grave without fear. He looks toward the grave with an expression of dread - clearly the thought of seeing his own remains terrifies him.Kassandra takes on the task of opening Giles' coffin herself. She finds a skeleton inside clutching a sheaf of paper. The fingers of the skeleton are clasped around the last part of the Grimoire in such a way that she is forced to break them off in order to free the papers. Giles accidentally turns around and recoils in horror.The two are on their way out of the cemetery when the Warlock appears, flying at them and levitating over the ground. Giles hurls the weather vane like a spear, but the Warlock dodges it, and it goes flying off into thick brush. Gilesseparates the papers into two stacks, giving Kassandra one half, saying they should split up in hopes of keeping the Warlock from reclaiming the entire Grimoire. But the Warlock is too smart for this. He corners Kassandra and tortures her, pulling off her sneaker and slowly driving a nail into her foot, sarcastically thanking Giles for giving him the idea. He digs the nail in deeper to make Kassandra scream in agony, and tells Giles that he will make her suffer far worse than Marion ever suffered, unless Giles emerges from the safety of the consecrated ground and hands over the last pages of the Grimoire. Giles points out that far more than just Kassandra's life is at stake, and the Warlock scoffs, saying that only the truly daft believe in the stories of the Uncreation. He issues a final ultimatum for Giles to surrender the pages.Giles puts the pages down on the ground, putting a small stone over them as a paperweight, and challenges the Warlock to fight him hand to hand, no spells or magic, to claim them. He answers the Warlock's retort that he gives up nothing, by pulling out his own weapons and throwing them to either side. The Warlock begins producing witch fire that dances between his hands, and Giles slyly suggests that without his magic, he is afraid. But afraid or not, the Warlock steps forward and he and Giles fight hand to hand. Giles starts to gain an advantage when he pushes the Warlock's head down onto the consecrated ground, burning him. Deciding that two can play that game, the Warlock answers by pushing his hand against Giles' face and sending a bolt of witch fire right into his mouth. Kassandra grabs Giles' whip and tries to garrote the Warlock with it, but he punches her with the back of his fist and hurls her into the river bordering the cemetery. Giles makes a last rush, but the Warlock uses his magic to throw him back, where he lands right atop his own coffin and looks, up close, at his own remains, causing him to scream in horror.Kassandra is starting to climb onto the riverbank when she stops, tasting something on her tongue. Fumbling with her purse, she grabs her insulin needles and climbs back down into the river.The Warlock triumphantly gathers up the last pages and recites a dark chant that causes all the pages of the Grimoire to reunite and form a complete book, which cracks the ground it lands on. A storm begins to break as the Warlock commands the Grimoire to reveal to him, the hidden name of God. Lightning flashes down and strikes the Grimoire, and invisible markings become visible, snaking and twisting into lines that form into letters spelling out a name: Rokisha or Roaisha.As thunder begins to rage, the Warlock cries out in triumph, shouting to God that he knows Him now; knows His true name-- the word that can undo all that He has wrought. But before he can shout the name out and pronounce it backward, Kassandra jumps on his back, clapping her hand over the Warlock's mouth, and jams her insulin needles into his neck. The Warlock easily throws her off with a hitch of his shoulder and pulls the needles out... and Kassandra triumphantly shouts for him to try saltwater.The salt in the river water injected into the warlock's body begins to destroy him from the inside out. His death-throes and agony are so great he cannot shout out God's name in reverse. He catches fire and burns alive in mid-air, finally sinking to the ground as a charred corpse. As Giles stands over the corpse, the burned skull suddenly begins to move as if to make one last effort at achieving the Warlock's goal, but Giles steps on the skull and crushes it.Giles thanks Kassandra for her heroism, saying that he is in her debt. He seems to be leaning in as if to kiss her, and Kassandra closes her eyes and slightly puckers her lips. A light breeze blows over her, and she opens her eyes to find Giles gone, and sees a small funnel of whirling air moving slowly toward his grave, where it adds to the writing already on the tombstone, I will remember you always 'til time and times are done. Kassandra is visibly moved by the new inscription, but then happens to turn and spot the Grand Grimoire, still lying on the ground, and she says, Oh... shoot.Cut to Kassandra burying the Grimoire in what appears to be snow... all around, is pure white. However, she is wearing only a light white tank-top shirt and no jacket, showing the weather is warm. She finishes burying the Grimoire and puts her shovel back into her car, then gets in and drives off, cheering. The camera pans out to show a large sign that reveals the location-- and resting place of the Grand Grimoire-- as the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah... the world's largest deposit of natural salt.

title: Gamer
synopsis: The film begins some years in the future from this exact moment. We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e.t.c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in Society. Practically all the game characters are dressed in ridiculous and skimpy costumes. Angie is controlled by an obese man named Gorge (Ramsey Moore). Gorge makes Angie talk to a male character who is wearing a pig nose. The male character licks and gropes Angie while her attention is to a banner across the street for Kable. Suddenly, Society is hacked into by Humanz who continue to condemn Castle. Castle watches a news report about how the hacking shut down the game for a little while and will cost him billions of dollars. Castle shrugs it off, since the money is just chump change to him. Elsewhere, the convicts for Slayers are being transported to the next battlefield. Sandra (Zoë Bell) introduces herself to Kable. The guards don't allow the convicts to talk, and so Sandra is beaten. The convicts run out to the battlefield (a city in ruins) armed with machine guns and bullet proof vests. The game begins and the guns are turned on. A massive shootout ensues with people being blown up, shot to death, set on fire, hit by trucks, etc. Kable sees a female convict pre-engineered to walk in the street as the battle goes on and trucks are driving all over the place. Simon has Kable save the convict from being run over, but she just winds up getting hit by another truck. Sandra saves Kable from being killed, but has her head blown off moments later. Simon has Kable fight through the brutality and win the battle. People all around the world cheer Kable's victory.During transport, one of the surviving convicts freaks out, wanting to get out. He wonders who exactly is controlling them during the battles. We see that Simon is a spoiled rich kid with the latest technology at his fingertips. Simon makes himself a sandwich and buys an ammo upgrade for Kable with all the points he won from the game. Simon talks with a variety of girls via instant message. A pair of twins flash their breasts to him and offer money in exchange for playing Kable. Simon refuses. His feed is hacked by Humanz, who show Simon footage of Kable shooting a man in the head in a room. A voice tells Simon that if he wants to talk to Kable, they can show him how. Meanwhile, Castle readies to introduce Hackman (Terry Crews) to Slayers. Castle of course has no intention of releasing Kable if he wins two more battles, and so he's purposefully placing Hackman in the game to eliminate Kable. No one will be controlling Hackman, allowing him free reign. A convict, fed up with being controlled, tries to rip the nano-cells form his brain but dies in the process. Freek sees Hackman and tells Kable that he killed a group of people but turned himself in to get in prison. Kable is brought outside for target practice with his upgraded ammo. Kable talks to a guard about being controlled. He doesn't like it, since there's a delay with each control from the player to the character. Later on, Hackman confronts Kable in the locker room with bloody hands. Hackman just killed someone and promises to kill Kable and his family.For the next battle, Kable suddenly hears Simon talking to him in his head. It's supposed to be impossible for gamers to talk to cons. Simon has fun talking to Kable while the battle ensues. Explosions sound off and motorcyclists race through the battlefield. Kable sees that Freek has been pre-engineered to sweep the ground. Freek winds up being caught in the crossfire and is shot to death. Simon remains desensitized and indifferent towards everyone dying, even though Kable reminds him that they're all real people. Simon has Kable search an abandoned parking garage. Kable exits and wants to go further, but Simon warns him that they're near the perimeter of the game. A rocket is fired at Kable to make him back away from the perimeter. Hackman pops up and attacks Kable. He's about to shoot Kable, but the game runs out of time and the gun shuts down. As the guards take Hackman away, Kable tells Simon that if he wants to win, he needs to turn him loose.Angie tries to apply to get her daughter back, but the caseworker (Sam Witwer) laughs in her face. With Kable being a convicted murderer and Angie working in Society, he asks if their daughter would really be better off with them. She says yes, but he pretty much denies her application, since the daughter has been relocated to a wealthy family. While Simon buys Kable upgraded armor, his feed is hacked into by Humanz. The Humanz Brother urges Simon to listen to Kable and set him loose. He knows that Castle will not allow Kable to survive. Simon knows that if he were to let Kable control himself, it would be cheating. However, Brother is able to convince Simon to help Kable. In his cell, Kable is approached by the same woman who took his autograph/blood. She tells him that Simon will grant him control of himself, and that he needs to escape his final battle if he ever wants to see his family again. Kable tells the voice that he needs to be drunk.While suiting up for his final battle, Kable finds a bottle of vodka in his vest. He downs the entire bottle before running outside with the other convicts. Kable, drunk, stumbles around the battlefield while Simon unhappily watches. He tells Kable to pull himself together if he wants to survive. Kable goes to the parking garage and forces himself to vomit in an ethanol gas tank of a truck. He then pisses in the tank and is able to start the truck. Before he can drive away, Hackman hangs onto the side of the truck. Kable beats Hackman and makes him crash into a pillar. Kable is pursued by guards in trucks. He manages to kill them and cause them to crash into each other. Kable crashes through the perimeter and runs from the truck just before a rocket is fired at him, blasting him away. The broadcast of the game stops and everyone assumes that Kable is dead. Gina doesn't believe it though and knows that Kable will try to reach Angie. While Angie is controlled by Gorge in Society, Kable goes to her apartment looking for her. Trace (Alison Lohman), a member of Humanz, approaches Kable and reveals herself to be the woman he talked to in prison. She has Kable get on her motorcycle and they drive off to the Humanz headquarters.Kable asks why they took a blood sample from him. They used his blood to crack his specific nano-code, which allowed Simon to talk to him (and for the Humanz to eavesdrop into their conversation). They know that Castle is afraid of Kable being free, and so they helped him escape. They want Kable to help them bring Castle down before he makes everyone his slave, but Kable isn't interested. Brother mentions that they know where Angie is. Gina has already located her and follows her in Society. Gorge makes Angie go to a bar where she meets the extremely horny Rick Rape (Milo Ventimiglia), who is a previously banned character. They go to a hotel, where he can't keep his hands off her. When they get to their room, Gorge has Angie bend down so that she can have sex with Rick. Angie clearly doesn't want to do it, but has no choice. Before Rick can violate her, Kable shows up and breaks Rick's back, killing him. Kable orders Gorge to let go of his control, but he can't and continues to talk through Angie. Kable goes to the elevator to leave with her when Hackman shows up. He shoots Kable in the chest, blasting him into the other room where characters are engaged in all kinds of S&M. Hackman takes Angie and gets in the elevator.Kable, still wearing his body armor, gets up and races downstairs. Two Society characters get in the elevator and make out. Gorge tells Hackman to kill the other characters, which he happily does. Gorge gets off on the violence while Angie is afraid. When the elevator opens, Kable grabs Hackman and fights him. He winds up grabbing a gun and blows off Hackman's foot. Castle's guards show up and engage Kable in a shootout. Kable asks Gorge where to go, and he has Angie lead him to a rave filled with Society characters. The guards follow and get in another shootout with Kable. A couple of Society characters are killed in the crossfire. They run outside, where Gina pulls up in her van. She tells Kable that she'll help him, and so they get in. Meanwhile, Simon is interrogated by Agent Keith (Keith David). Keith tells Simon that the authorities are going through his computer and all his files. He wants Simon to tell him how Kable managed to escape from Slayers.Gina drives to the Humanz headquarters, where they help Angie. They can't take the nano-cells out of her, since they are fully integrated in her brain. However, they inject her with something that will help stop her from being controlled. Brother tells Kable that Castle first tested the nanotechnology on two military subjects Kable and Scotch (Johnny Whitworth). Some weeks later Scotch was dead, Kable was in prison, and the project was shut down. The same technology was seen again later on when Castle came out with Society. Brother wants to know what happened during the project, since Castle wanted everything associated with it buried. Castle's goons go to Gorge's apartment claiming to be tech support. Meanwhile, the Humanz examine Kable's memories. During the project, Kable entered a room with Scotch. Kable pulled out a gun and aimed it at Scotch. Kable tried to control himself but couldn't. Castle, manipulating Kable, made him kill Scotch. Angie wakes up and reunites with Kable. She tells him that she tried to stop the government from taking their girl but failed. Trace tells them that the Humanz found out that Castle adopted their daughter.Kable, full of rage, leaves to get his daughter back. Gina runs after him, but he tells her to leave him alone. Gina sees Castle's henchmen arriving and infiltrating the Humanz headquarters. Simon is released from custody after questioning. He goes back home and finds a bombardment of hate mail. Castle knows that Kable will come to him. Kable enters Castle's mansion and sees his daughter sitting in a room. He runs over to her but can't enter the room. It turns out to be a simulation projected on a screen. Castle tells Kable that it's his latest invention. Kable finds Castle controlling several other people and doing an elaborate song/dance number. Kable fights and kills all the henchmen. Kable gets his hands on Castle, but he threatens his daughter. He reveals that he located the Humanz headquarters and slaughtered everyone. He also reveals that he implanted the nano-cells into his own brain years ago. While everyone else is set to receive, his are set to transmit. He can control anyone by thought alone. His plan is to control everyone in the world and make them do whatever he wants.Castle leads Kable to a basketball court, where Hackman is shooting hoops with his new foot. Castle controls Hackman and makes him attack Kable with a knife. Kable brutally beats him (including breaking his arm) and snaps his neck twice to kill him. Kable grabs the knife and tries to use it on Castle, but he controls Kable to stop. Meanwhile, we see that Trace survived the Humanz slaughter. She and Gina broadcast Kable's nano-code to the world, giving a live feed of what he sees. Castle makes Kable slice his leg with the knife. He then takes off his shirt and beats Kable while the world watches. Castle has his goons bring in Angie and her daughter. Castle controls Kable and tries to have him kill his daughter with the knife. Kable suddenly slams the knife into the floor, picks it up, and tries to use it on Castle. Simon has regained control of Kable's body. As they fight for control over the knife, Castle boasts I think it, you do it!. Kable tells him to think about getting stabbed in the gut. Since Castle thinks about it, Kable is able to stab Castle and kill him. The world cheers Castle's demise. Kable has Castle's technicians turn off the nano-cells, making them free.The film ends with Kable, Angie, and their daughter driving off into the unknown, but free.

title: The Mouse That Roared
synopsis: The Mouse that RoaredThe world's smallest nation, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, which lies on the Swiss-French border, is quietly and prosperously ruled by the Grand Duchess Gloriana XII (Peter Sellers), with the assistance of the Hereditary Prime Minister, Count Rupert of Mountjoy (Peter Sellers), the Hereditary Field Marshall and Grand Constable, Tully Bascombe (Peter Sellers) and the Leader of the Loyal Opposition, David Bentner (Leo McKern).Disaster strikes, however, when the Duchy's only export, its wine, Pinot Grand Fenwick, is undercut in the United States by a Californian copy, Pinot Grand Enwick. Faced with bankruptcy, and having had no reply to its protests, the Duchy decides to declare war on the United States, Mountjoy having reasoned that it will certainly lose and will then be magnificently rehabilitated by the generous, victorious Americans. A Declaration of War is duly sent, but is considered a press-room joke by its recipient in Washington.Tully Bascombe, his lieutenant Will Buckley (William Hartnell), and twenty soldiers, in chain mail and armed with longbows, including Roger (Timothy Bateson) and Cobbley (Monte Landis) and (Alan Gifford), are sent to invade the United States, making the first part of their journey by bus and then by tramp steamer, captained by Pedro (Harold Kasket), encountering, en route, the QEII (captain Stuart Saunders, second officer Ken Stanley), which they mistakenly attack.In New York, an air-raid exercise has closed the entire city, with the exception of the laboratory of Professor Alfred Kokintz (David Kossoff) at the New York Institute of Physics, where he and his daughter Helen (Jean Seberg) are working on the new Q-bomb: an air-raid warden (Wally Brown) tries to get them to take shelter, but the Professor shows him the Q-bomb - an active working model on a hair-trigger - which he must deactivate first. The Grand Fenwick party land, but can find no-one to surrender to: in Central Park, they encounter a decontamination squad, Mulligan (Richard Gatehouse) and O'Hara (George Margo), who believe the Fenwickians in their shiny mail are men from Mars invading the city: this rumour rapidly spreads through the crowds in the shelters. The Grand Fenwick party takes the decontamination squad's van, trying to reach the Arsenal, but instead end up at the Institute of Physics, where they take Prof. Kokintz, Helen and the Q-bomb captive.General Snippet (Macdonald Parke), in charge of the New York exercise, alerted by an army captain (Bill Edwards) of the spread of rumours of men from Mars, arrives with four New York policemen (Bill Nagy): they are also taken captive. Leaving the Grand Fenwick flag flying from the New York customs shed, the Grand Fenwick party re-embarks and returns home. Prof. Kokintz persuades Helen to try and seduce Tully, to persuade him to allow her father to deactivate the Q-bomb, but Tully, seasick, is unreceptive. In France, the Americans cannot get anyone (ticket collector, Jacques Cey) to listen to them.Back in Grand Fenwick the whole country is excitedly preparing to welcome the American victors, and planning what to spend the money on: they are dumbfounded when Tully arrives with his prisoners and declares that Grand Fenwick won. The Q-bomb is taken to the dungeons, Prof. Kokintz and his daughter to the castle, and the General and policemen to the Museum of Ancient Torture before the policemen are also taken to comfortable quarters in the castle: the General, insisting on his exact rights under the Geneva Convention, is shown to a small, dim cell with a tin plate of food.The U.S. Secretary of Defense (Austin Wills) finally puts together the pieces and realizes that the United States has been defeated: he has to tell the President, persuade the Pentagon generals (Lionel Murton) that this is the only course, and then go to Grand Fenwick to surrender. Meanwhile Grand Fenwick by its possession of the Q-bomb has now become the most powerful nation on the planet, as explained by the BBC Announcer (Colin Gordon).In Grand Fenwick's parliament, messages of support arrive from numerous other countries - all offering also to take the Q-bomb. The British (Charles Clay), French (Henry de Bray) and Soviet (Guy Deghy) Ambassadors convene at the frontier, and Will Buckley makes the U.S. Secretary of Defense, arriving to discuss the U.S.'s surrender, wait also. In frustration, Mountjoy and Bentner, and their parties, all resign, leaving Tully as the new Prime Minister.Mountjoy and Bentner now decide the only course is to help the Americans to escape and take the Q-bomb with them: they release the General and policemen, and give them the Q-bomb, and they also persuade Helen to leave, but not before Tully has declared his love for her: Prof. Kokintz, being entertained by the Duchess on the harpsichord, cannot be found. Taking the Duchess' elderly car, the Americans drive away, but are pursued by Tully. The car stalls and has to be pushed over a hill-crest: it then runs away with the General and the Q-bomb on board, running into a haystack, which sets the Q-bomb into high alert mode: tossed from hand to hand, it is captured by Tully and returned to the Duchy.Tully and the U.S. Secretary of Defense now discuss the peace treaty terms; the Californian wine will be discontinued, Prof. Kokintz and Helen, who will now marry Tully, will remain in Grand Fenwick, and so will the Q-bomb: as the Duchess points out, any atomic war would destroy Grand Fenwick anyway, and the big nations have not succeeded in nuclear disarmament, so now it is time for a League of Little Nations to try.Prof. Kokintz, finally allowed to disarm the Q-bomb, drops it! It was a dud all along: or was it? The little white mouse that emerges from it may know.

title: Moonstruck
synopsis: Thirty-seven-year-old Loretta Castorini (Cher), an Italian-American widow, is a bookkeeper in Brooklyn Heights, New York, where she lives with her family: her father Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) a successful plumber; her mother Rose (Olympia Dukakis); and her paternal grandfather (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr). Her boyfriend Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to be with his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death. Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the real wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves.
The next day, Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery. He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fiancée; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fiancée left him. Loretta insists that they discuss the matter upstairs in his apartment, where she cooks for him and then tells him that she believes he is a wolf who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then carrying her to his bed where they make love. At the same time, Cosmo is dining with his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette) and giving her jewelry.
That evening, Rose's brother Raymond (Louis Guss) and his wife Rita (Julie Bovasso) join Rose and Cosmo for dinner, and they all wonder where Loretta is. Raymond recalls that when he was a boy and Cosmo was courting Rose, he thought that a particularly bright moon one night was somehow brought to the house by Cosmo because of his love for Rose. That night, Loretta remains at Ronny's apartment and sees such a moon; Raymond sees it as well, and it leads him and Rita to make love. The next morning, Loretta tells Ronny they can never see each other again. She slaps him when he claims to be in love with her (Snap out of it!) and he agrees to never see her again if she will attend the opera (his other great love) with him that night. She agrees. She then goes to church and confesses her infidelity. She unexpectedly sees her mother there, and Rose tells her that Cosmo is having an affair; Loretta is doubtful. Loretta then goes to Raymond and Rita's store to close out the cash register, after which she impulsively goes to the hair salon and buys a glamorous evening gown.
Loretta and Ronny (wearing a tuxedo) meet at Lincoln Center, and each is impressed with the other's appearance. Loretta is deeply moved by her first opera, Puccini's La bohème. But as they leave, Loretta sees Cosmo and Mona, and she confronts her father. He sees that she is with Ronny, and he suggests that they simply agree that they didn't see each other at all, but Loretta is conflicted. Loretta then intends to return home alone, but Ronny leads her back to his apartment where he passionately and desperately persuades her into another tryst. The same night, Rose dines alone at a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry (John Mahoney), being dramatically dumped by a female student, a similar scene having played out with a different girl the night Johnny proposed to Loretta. Rose invites Perry to dine with her, asks him why men pursue women, and then shares with him her belief that men pursue women because they fear death. Perry walks Rose home and tries to convince her to invite him in; she refuses because I'm married. Because I know who I am. Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother's miraculous recovery and goes to Loretta's house; Rose explains that she's not there and then asks him why men chase women. He tells her it may be because they fear death, with which Rose agrees. After this exchange he leaves, planning to return in the morning to see Loretta.
In the morning, Loretta returns home in a reverie but is then distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be there soon. Ronny then arrives, and Rose notes their matching love bites and invites him for breakfast over Loretta's objections. Cosmo and his father emerge from upstairs, and the older man cajoles Cosmo into agreeing to pay for Loretta's wedding. Rose then confronts Cosmo and, after he acknowledges in response to her questioning that she has been a good wife, demands that he end his affair; he is upset but agrees and, after insistence from Rose, also agrees to go to confession, and they then affirm their love for each other. Raymond and Rita also arrive, concerned and seemingly reluctantly suspicious, to find out why Loretta didn't make the previous day's bank deposit; they are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money. When Johnny finally arrives, he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother's death. Loretta, momentarily offended by his breaking the engagement, chastises Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him. Seizing the moment, Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him; she accepts. To Rose's chagrin, Loretta declares that she loves Ronny. The family toasts the couple with champagne and a befuddled Johnny joins in at the grandfather's urging, as he will now be part of the family after all.

title: Uncharted 2: Among Thieves
synopsis: A beaten and disoriented Nathan Drake awakes in a tattered train seat. He looks around the car in confusion, then glances down to see a bullet wound in his stomach. His head rolls back as the pain hits him, and he notices that snowflakes drifting outside the window appear to be falling...sideways. Right on cue, his seat jerks and violently detaches from its mounting, hurtling him downwards through the vertical train car to hang above a dizzying drop.After an agonising climb to safety above, Nate lurches through the wreckage, recalling the events that led him to this place.Six months prior to the train crash, Nate is found at a beachfront bar where he encounters Harry Flynn: an old acquaintance and sometime partner in crime in the shadowy world of black market antiquities. The British thief has a client willing to pay a substantial sum for him to procure an item inside the Istanbul Palace Museum. Nate is skeptical: knowing of two others who died at the hands of the museum's extensive and overzealous security force, he himself barely escaped the building during a previous illicit out-of-hours visit.Flynn insists that he requires Nate's assistance to make the theft, and introduces a third conspirator: Chloe Frazer, an Australian he describes as an expert getaway driver. He explains that the commission is a clay oil lamp, a seemingly unremarkable artifact inside the museum's Travel of Marco Polo exhibit. Nate initially dismisses the item as worthless, and Flynn's benefactor a collector with more money than sense, but an oblique revelation in a document written by Marco Polo changes his mind. Polo's fleet left China with 600 passengers aboard 14 ships, loaded with treasure from the great Kublai Khan. It landed in Persia a year and a half later, diminished to one vessel and 18 survivors. Polo documented every detail of the expedition - but never disclosed the fate of the missing ships and travellers.Nate speculates that the lamp contains a hidden message from Polo, revealing the fate of his lost fleet, undoubtedly laden with treasures of incalculable worth. Finding this, the trio believe, is the true purpose of Flynn's unusual assignment.Chloe is the first to articulate what all three are thinking: So - we're dicking this guy over, right?Nate is awakened in his hotel room by a knock at the door, and opens it to find Chloe standing outside. The two are, unbeknownst to Flynn, intimately acquainted; though we discover that Nate ended their previous relationship, she bears him no rancor. When Chloe recognised the scope of Flynn's commission, she decided that Nate would want to be involved. She suggests that they complete the heist, find Polo's lost ships, split the treasure three ways - and then abandon Flynn to elope.Nate, Chloe and Flynn enter the sewer system beneath the Istanbul Palace Museum. Chloe departs to deactivate the floodlights illuminating the tower where the Polo exhibit is held, leaving Nate and Flynn to infiltrate the main building.After several close calls with the security personnel, the duo reaches the exhibit. With an apology to its long-dead owner, Nate smashes the ceramic lamp to find a weathered scroll, seemingly lacking any legible details, and pieces of a strange residue. Flynn is distraught, but Nate has a hunch. Identifying the substance as resin, the latter lights a piece - and the room is suffused with an eerie blue glow as it glows.In this light, the previously blank scroll is covered with Latin script and a map. Nate, translating, learns that Polo's fleet was hit by a tsunami, and carried inland to rest beside a mountain somewhere on the west coast of Borneo. As Nate translates, Polo's words attribute this misfortune to an unusual source: It was as if the ocean itself sought to throw off the terrible cargo we carried from Sham-bah-lah - the curse of the Cintamani.Nate is astonished: My God, Flynn - Marco Polo found Shambhala. Shangri-La. If they were carrying the Cintamani Stone, it might still be there.As Nate prepares to follow Flynn out from the tower, the former is betrayed. Left stranded in the exhibit, Nate is helpless as Flynn shoots display cases, triggering a cacophony of alarms. Claiming to simply want Nate out of the way for a time, but clearly enjoying the upper hand, Flynn chides his horrified partner: You think I didn't know about the ships from the beginning? Any schoolboy could've figured that out. Face it, genius. You've been played.Though Nate makes a valiant attempt to escape, he is cornered and arrested by the Turkish police.3 months later we rejoin Nate in a filthy, cramped cell, and find him amusing himself with a shadow puppet recreation of Flynn's betrayal - with a carthartic twist. As the Nate puppet draws a gun and shoots the Flynn puppet in a new fantasy denouement, his show is interrupted by a shadow falling across the wall. He turns to find Victor Sullivan standing outside the bars, the latter having arrived to bail out his old friend at great expense...but is significantly less overjoyed to cast eyes on Chloe.After convincing him of her innocence, the Australian informs Nate that Flynn and his client Lazarovic have found Polo's lost ships in Borneo, though they have yet to find the Cintamani Stone. This Buddhist holy grail, as Chloe describes it, is a perfect raw sapphire worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Because Chloe possesses insider knowledge and unrestricted access to Lazarevic's camp through her continued association with Flynn, the trio concoct a plan to snatch the treasure for themselves. Lazarevic has paid enormous sums to collect Polo's lesser-known journals, and has pursued the Cintamani Stone for many years. These documents, Chloe tells Nate, can be found in his command tent at the Borneo excavation site. She will engineer a diversion; the rest is up to Nate and Sully.In a swamp pockmarked with excavation sites, the petrified remains of Polo's fleet protruding from their open graves, Nate and Sully prime explosives laid at the camp's perimeter. Reconnoitering the command tent through binoculars, Chloe's hidden microphone providing an audio feed, they observe Goran Lazarevic - a tall, powerfully built Eastern European in black combat gear - castigate Harry Flynn for his lack of progress, then coldly execute an employee accused of theft.Sully activates the detonator, and a series of explosions rock the jungle to the south of the command tent. Lazarevic and his men pour out to investigate, allowing Nate to slip into the headquarters. While Sully watches over him with a sniper rifle, Nate ransacks the extensive collection of documents. He's impressed by what he finds: Man, this Lazarevic guy isn't screwing around, Sully, he enthuses. You should see all this stuff. He's got files on every expedition to find Shambhala - all the way back to the 1600s.Reading a journal written by Marco Polo, Nate learns that he truly believed the tsunami to be divine retribution for the dreadful cargo carried by his ships, but that he purposely left the Cintamani Stone in Shambhala. He also writes of a golden passport, a detail that Nate doesn't understand. Lazarevic, Nate decides, is seeking to retrace Polo's journey back to Shambhala.When he learns that Lazarevic's men have failed to find a single body in the shipwrecks, Nate intuits that the missing passengers must have fled to higher ground. Escaping the returning soldiers, Nate and Sully climb the mountain that overlooks the camp.Nate and Sully meet with Chloe at the entrance to a hidden mountain cave. Inside they encounter hundreds of skeletons, with one salient detail leaping from the macabre scene: each corpse has inexplicably blackened teeth.Lighting a piece of resin and placing it in a torch, Nate discovers the shadows of past slaughters: there is blood everywhere. This, the three speculate, was the site of a massacre - and the passengers appear to have killed each other. Following a bloody trail, they reach a room in which a single skeleton clutches a lacquered box in its arms. Inside, they find a Phurba: a Tibetan ceremonial dagger. The cloth it is wrapped in is a crude map, accompanied by a short message.Between Greater India and the province of Tibet, Nate translates, lies a field of exquisitely finished temples, hundreds of gilded spires stretching as far as the eye can see. In all these many temples, only one conceals the secret path to Shambhala - and that path shall only be revealed to the pilgrim who bears the golden passport.At the last line, Chloe raises the Phurba in acknowledgement: it must be the golden passport. The field of temples, Sully comments, is now a city in Nepal. With their next destination settled, the group departs...but encounters Flynn accompanied by Lazarevic's soldiers. Chloe holds the protagonists at gunpoint and hurries to present Flynn with the map to conceal her subterfuge, but artfully leaves the dagger in Nate's possession. After helping her friends to escape as they are escorted back to the camp, Chloe tells Nate to meet her in Nepal.Nate arrives in a war-torn Nepalese city, and is astonished by the devastation that awaits him. Chloe comments that the region has teetered on the brink of civil war for some time; Lazarevic simply needed to fan the flames. In the ensuing chaos, he and his army are tearing the city apart with near impunity as they seek the temple documented on the map found on Borneo.After surviving fraught encounters with Lazarevic's mercenaries, Nate is reunited with Chloe. He speculates that the emblem on the ceremonial dagger will correspond to another on the temple they seek - they just need a high vantage point to scan the city. Chloe suggests a nearby hotel. After a perilous ascent to the roof of the ruined building, Nate scours the urban sprawl and finds a temple marked with the symbol of the Cintamani Stone.After a protracted battle with a helicopter gunship, Nate is briefly separated from Chloe. As he walks through the side streets he is astonished to encounter Elena Fisher, accompanied by her cameraman, Jeff. She is in the region to obtain footage of Lazarevic, who she describes as a fugitive war criminal who NATO erroneously believes to have perished in a bombing raid. She intuitively suspects that Nate is somehow caught up in these events, despite his attempts to be evasive - and then Chloe arrives, confirming her suspicions.Nate insists that they must escort Elena and Jeff to safety. Though amused by his discomfort at the meeting of the two women, Chloe is extremely reluctant. You don't always have to play the bloody hero, you know, she remarks, a little bitterly. Just...dance with the one who brought you, all right?Nate is intractable: Yeah, I get it, he says with sincerity. Then firmly: But they're still coming with us.As Lazarevic's forces attack once again, the four fight their way across the ravaged city to arrive at the temple.In the temple courtyard, Elena questions Nate about his motives, and he offers an honest account - much to Chloe's annoyance. Elena is nonplussed: So let me get this straight - you're competing with a pyschopathic war criminal for a mythological gemstone?In turns amused, incredulous and resigned as she listens to Nate's explanations, Elena offers an insight into the brutal warlord's intentions: This just doesn't add up, Nate... Lazarevic can't be after the money. He doesn't need it. You're missing something.Leaving the newcomers just inside the temple entrance, the protagonists enter the main chamber where they find a massive statue: perhaps the same wrathful deity depicted on the ceremonial dagger. Nate aligns four of its six hands into the correct position, then experiences a brainwave: the Phurba dagger is a key! Sliding its triangular blade into a slot on the statue's chest, they unlock a hidden entrance.As they enter the subterranean tunnels, Nate notices a relief of a tree on a wall, which he finds strangely incongruous. After some further exploration, Nate opens a hidden shaft leading to a domed chamber. Placing the Phurba dagger in a slot, Nate and Chloe gasps as the central floor area is revealed to be composed of thousands of tiny rods. These undulate and rise to form a relief map of a mountain range. A single beam of light from the roof above highlights a precise spot. Nate is excited: Chloe, I know where that is!On a map depicting a Himalayan mountain range stolen from Lazarevic's camp, Nate compares the peaks, and marks the correct spot with an X. At that moment, Chloe's radio bursts to life with the chatter of Lazarevic's approaching forces, causing her and Nate to fight their way back to the surface.In the courtyard outside, Nate finds Elena frightened but unharmed - though Jeff is bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. Chloe stridently insists that they can do nothing for him, and that they make good their escape, but Nate is resolute. With Lazarevic's forces swarming from all directions, Nate half-carries the dying cameraman as they flee from one skirmish to another.The group reaches a dead end: an apartment where the only exit is a 15-foot drop to the alley below that Jeff could not possibly survive. Nate gently props the cameraman against an overturned table. A panicked Chloe pleads with Nate to leave him behind, to escape before it is too late... and then they hear the sound of footsteps pounding up the stairs outside.Chloe desperately levels her gun at Nate and Elena as Flynn bursts in, flanked by mercenaries. A flicker of recognition registers on Flynn's face; he finally understands Chloe's deception, but nonetheless pulls her towards him. Nate and Elena, outgunned, drop their weapons. Flynn orders that Chloe be taken away to safety. As she leaves, Lazarevic strides into the room.The villian takes the Phurba dagger from Nate's belt, regards it briefly, then hands it to his burly lieutenant. His gaze alights on Jeff. Did you carry him all the way from the temple? he enquires. Nate remains silent. Shame, intones Lazarevic flatly, drawing a handgun to execute the cameraman with a single shot.Nate attempts to bargain for Elena's life: without him, he tells Lazarevic, the Serbian cannot find the entrance to Shambhala. A cursory search, however, reveals the map that Nate is carrying...with his hastily scrawled X making a mockery of his attempted negotiation. Lazarevic strides from the room with both map and Phurba dagger in his possession, leaving Flynn to kill the prisoners. As he gloats, Elena seizes an opportunity and staggers him with a full-blooded punch to the face. With Nate, she leaps from the room into the alley below, and both run for their lives...After escaping their pursuers, Nate and Elena take a moment to catch their breath. Nate reflects on Flynn's orders when Chloe was escorted away - Take her to the train - and surmises that Lazarevic's personal army must be heading for a nearby rail yard.On arrival, they observe Lazarevic's men loading gear into the cars of a waiting train, and Flynn hustling a reluctant Chloe on board. The sheer numbers ranged against Nate, and the sudden departure of the train, forces abrupt improvisation. Riding in a 4x4 after a timely rescue by Elena, they draw alongside the train, allowing Nate to jump on board.Steadily fighting his way over and through the speeding train, Nate overcomes incredible odds to reach Chloe's car. There, he encounters Lazarevic's right-hand man, and the two engage in a savage fistfight. After seemingly besting this brute of a man, Nate retrieves the Phurba dagger from his belt, then incautiously turns his back. The antagonist, having swifty regained his wits, grabs the exhausted Nate and begins to strangle him. A gunshot rings out - and we see Chloe, pistol raised, as the henchman falls dead to the floor.Nate stumbles towards his saviour, then notes that her gun remains trained on him. Get off the train, Nate, she says, quietly. I never asked for any of your bloody heroics.Chloe refuses to leave with Nate, still angry for his earlier insistence on helping Elena and Jeff, risking her life. Well, good luck with Flynne! he barks angrily, turning away. You two deserve each other.Nate's ire dissolves rapidly as he turns, exasperated, to reason with his old friend and sometime flame. As he begins to speak, another shot rings out - and Drake staggers from the impact. Chloe's eyes widen with horror as blood spreads across Nate's abdomen, then Flynn steps forward from behind her, gun raised. As the malign Brit pursues the gravely wounded Nate, Chloe desperately attempts to forestall the killing shot. With soldiers arriving from the opposite direction, Nate lies propped against a seat, desperately scanning his surroundings for a means of escape. His eyes alight on a collection of propane tanks... and with nothing to lose, he fires.The explosion rocks the train, decoupling it from the cars containing Flynn, Chloe and the main body of Lazarevic's forces. The forward section continues along the tracks, while Nate's section derails. As the tumbling wreckage ploughs into a snow bank, he blacks out.Revisiting the opening scenes of the story, Nate escapes the train car and retrieves the Phurba dagger. When Lazarevic's forces arrive to search for him Nate summons every last screed of willpower to defeat them, then slumps into the snow. As his vision fades once again, he sees the silhouette of a mysterious figure striding towards him...Nate awakes on a bed in a cozy Tibetan house. Groaning as he attempts to sit upright, he instinctively reaches for the wound on his stomach - but finds it healed.Though neither Nate nor his saviour Tenzin understand each other's language, they infer meaning through gestures and tonality. The latter escorts the former through his village, framed against the spectacular backdrop of the Himalayas. Inside another house he is reunited with Elena, who throws her arms around him in relief. They are taken to meet Karl Schafer: a German in his nineties, but with the bearing of a much younger man, clothed in traditional Tibetan attire. He greets Nate warmly.It appears you and I have much in common, Mr. Drake, says Schafer. Seventy years ago, I came here just like you - carried into the village, near death, the last survivor of my company. I was hired to lead an expedition into Tibet, to find the entrance to Shambhala. What they really wanted was the Cintamani Stone.Though Nate insists that he has no desire to continue his pursuit, Schafer is powerfully persuasive: Lazarevic must be stopped. Some of the most fearsome rulers through history have possessed only a fraction of the Cintamani Stone, warns Schafer, men like Tamerlane, Genghis Khan. If a mere sliver could bestow such power, what would a man become if he possessed the Stone itself?Nate is doubtful, but Schafer insists that he accompanies Tenzin to the cave where the remains of his expedition can be found.After a perilous climb through an ice cave high in the mountains, Nate and Tenzin begin to find evidence of Schafer's expedition, but fail to discover the proof that the German spoke of. Nevertheless, deep inside the cave, a hideous monster - its apelike body covered in coarse hair, a skeletal visage crowned by massive curled horns - bowls Tenzin from its feet and roars, revealing a mouth full of jagged teeth. Nate fires on the creature with a Luger pistol found on the corpse of a mummified, long-dead German. Though shot several times and stabbed by Tenzin, the duo cannot kill the creature, and succeed only in driving it away.Further into the cavern, they ascend a stone staircase to reach arcane ruins presumable belonging to a long-lost civilisation. Tenzin and Nate activate massive ancient mechanisms as they travel through the imposing caverns, eventually opening a secret chamber. Inside, Nate finds several frozen bodies, with a cursory examination revealing that each one died from a gunshot wound. They are all dressed in 1930s mountaineering garb. This, Nate concludes, is the final group from Schafer's expedition.Tenzin finds a book. Its cover, warped and stained with age, depicts a tree in the shape of a T. Tenzin taps it quizzically, and Nate identifies it as the Tree of Life. Nate regards the chamber more closely, and sees the Cintamani Stone everywhere, each time held by a seemingly demonic figure somehow anointed and transformed by its power. Inside the book, images depict powerful characters holding it aloft, bathed in its aura, as they lay waste to those who oppose them.Realisation dawns: Tenzin - Schafer did this, says Nate, urgently. Schafer killed them. It was the only way to stop them.Bestial howls fill the cavern. Nate and Tenzin rush to escape to the surface as the unearthly creatures hunt them. As they look down to the valley below, they see Tenzin's village in flames...Back in the village, Nate meets briefly with a panicked Elena, then rushes to find Schafer and Tenzin's daughter. Aiding the villagers in their defense against Lazarevic's mercenaries as they search, Nate and Tenzin work together to first evade, then destroy a tank as it devastates the settlement. With the attack apparently repelled, an overjoyed Tenzin is reunited with his daughter. However, the reason for Lazarevic's sudden departure soon becomes clear: he has claimed the Phurba dagger and taken Schafer hostage.Nate and Elena leap into a truck to give chase; they barely escape with their lives when an explosion sends their vehicle careening over a cliff edge. Viewing the road ahead through binoculars, Nate sees Lazarevic with Schafer outside a long-abandoned cliff-side monastery.Nate and Elena continue their pursuit, tracking Lazarevic's company through the ancient monastery, while eliminating or evading those left behind to stop them. They eventually find Schafer near death, having been brutalised and abandoned by Lazarevic. Did you find my expedition? he rasps, struggling to breathe. You understand what I had to do? If they had found the stone, it would have changed the course of history.Schafer tells Nate that the monastery hides the secret path to Shambhala and, with his final words, pleads with him to stop Lazarevic, then destroy the Cintamani Stone. Nate remains cynical, but is swayed by the sheer force of the German's conviction. He believed it - that's enough for me.Nate and Elena separate, with the former pursuing the Phurba dagger, and the latter seeks the hidden entrance. On his way to the dilapidated tower where Lazarevic, Flynn and Chloe are located, he observes scenes of slaughter as the horned beasts he encountered earlier massacre Lazarevic's men.Entering the tower via a hole in the wall, he eavesdrops as Lazarevic lambasts Flynn for failing to find the entrance. Fortuitously, Flynn leaves to speak to Lazarevic as he stalks from the room, leaving Chloe with the Phurba. As soon as the coast is clear, Nate drops down to confront the Australian. Though reluctant - How am I supposed to explain where it's gone? - she surrenders the ceremonial blade to Nate.Nate and Elena reconvene to open a secret entrance beneath a tree in the courtyard, before entering the subterranean tunnels beneath the monastery. They arrive in a circular chamber,but, poised to open the entrance to Shambhala, find themselves helpless to resist as Lazarevic and his men pour in. Though the villian attempts to toy with Nate, engaging him to choose between rescuing Elena or Chloe, Nate boldly strides forward to open the entrance, adeptly defusing the situation.In the caverns beyond, the path lies open - and then a mechanism activates, rotating the stone bridge to prevent further passage. Nate is sent with Flynn to restore it to its previous position. The two trade barbed comments as they negotiate the hazardous tunnel, hostility dripping from every insult and riposte. After realigning the bridge, though, they are forced to fight side by side as the horned monsters attack. Armed with just pistols, they can only briefly deter the creatures from their relentless assaults... but then Lazarevic enters, and calmly kills them with powerful incendiary blasts from his shotgun.Lazarevic strides over to a horned creature and grabs its jaw, pulling its head back. All present are astonished as he rips a mask aside to reveal a human face: it is a man clad in a costume, his teeth stained black in the same manner as the skeletons encountered in Borneo. Scarecrows, Lazarevic laughs to himself. Guardians to frighten trespassers.As Lazarevic's men open the gates to Shambhala, they are greeted by an incredible vista. The valley is framed by snow-capped peaks, but the ancient city that lies in the basin is awash with verdant greenery.The villian is satisfied, but unmoved by the beauty he beholds. Though Flynn risks his life to rescue Chloe, threatening to withdraw his support should she die, the warlod rounds on Nate and Elena. But as Lazarevic brings his weapon to bear, his murderous focus is disturbed by a sudden rain of arrows. Shouting and whooping in an indecipherable tongue, a band of giant, heavily muscled Guardians - the men who, outside, occupied the horned suits - pepper the crowd with their primitive weapons. In the unfolding chaos, Chloe savagely elbows Flynn aside with a sharp blow to the nose, then escapes with Nate and Elena to the city below.The three push further into the ruins, where Nate discovers pockets of the blue resin encountered throughout the journey. He identifies it as sap deposited by the tree roots; when shot, it creates a blinding flash, causing nearby roots to retract.After pinpointing their destination, they fight their way to a distinct pyramidal temple in the distance.Inside the temple, they find the enormous Cintamani Stone set in a stone pillar resembling a tree. Nate immediately senses that something is wrong, and then experiences a tumbling sequence of revelations. The Stone is not sapphire, as Marco Polo believed, but amber: fossilised resin, once tree sap.Nate rushes outside, his companions trailing behind in confusion. How could I have missed it? he berates himself. There's not actually a Stone - it's the resin. The sap - from the Tree of Life.And then, they see it: the tree in the courtyard below. Looking around it, they realise that it has grown rampant with age, its roots penetrating every part of the crumbling city.They observe Lazarevic approaching the Tree of Life. Nate lowers his binoculars in shock as he intuits the warlord's intention. Oh my God - the black teeth, he exclaims. The black teeth, on those Guardian things...and the bodies in Borneo. They ate resin, and it changed them somehow.A voice behind them causes them to spin, as Flynn emerges from concealment. He is wounded, bleeding profusely. He slides his back against a pillar to slump to a sitting position, his strength waning. Elena rushes to his aid, and attempts to reason with him... but Flynn produces a grenade, its pin removed. With a final parting quip, he allows it to drop to the ground. Nate and Chloe are merely bowled over by the blast, but Elena is badly injured.Nate fights Lazarevic's men to clear a path for Chloe to carry Elena, and the three reach a bridge leading to the exit. There, Nate insists that Chloe escape with Elena... and returns to confront Lazarevic.Nate descends into the chamber beneath the Tree of Life, the tree's roots descending as columns from above. At the center of the chamber, below the main trunk, is a pool of luminous azure sap.Beside the pool stand Lazarevic and his remaining men. The warlod cups his hands into the liquid and drinks deeply. He becomes rigid as the elixir enters his body... then relaxes. His eyes flash with a luminescent glow as Nate, astonished, watches the scars covering his face and arm spontaneously heal. Lazarevic looks thoughtful, then calls out: Drake!Sensing that the opportunity for a surprise attack is passing, Nate pops out from cover and fires three rounds into Lazarevic's chest, the latter flinching momentarily - then shrugging off the inconsequential injuries. Desperation is followed by a flash of inspiration, and Nate fires into the azure pool. It explodes in an eruption of blue-white flames, consuming Lazarevic and his men.Spared the force of the blast, Drake exhales in relief as he looks down at the broken corpses, but Lazarevic's limbs begin to inexplicably twist and straighten. He rises unbowed - and seemingly immortal.With Lazarevic impervious to bullets Nate survives by shooting pockets of resin, repeatedly engulfing his crazed adversary in blue flames as he is stalked through the chamber. In this protracted and vicious encounter, the warlord appears more determined to brutalise and humiliate his opponent than kill him outright. As the battle reaches its climax, the chamber ablaze as the Tree of Life enters its death throes, Lazarevic slumps bloodied but defiant to his knees. He taunts his adversary to deliver the coup de grace, but Nate declines... then backs away carefully as the furious Guardians pour into the chamber, tearing the warlord to shreds as they are consumed by the spreading fire.As the Tree of Life dies, the entire valley is convulsed by tremors as its roots retract, pulling the city apart. Nate, though bloodied and bruised, makes a desperate sprint to safety. Reunited with Chloe and Elena, the three survive a last encounter with an enraged Guardian before escaping to the monastery above.Exhausted, Nate lays Elena down gently and kneels beside her. She is pale and unconscious as the distraught Nate holds her close, while Chloe looks on with grim sympathy. The scene fades...Back in the Tibetan village, Tenzin congratulates Nate; his reply in his friend's tongue suggests that time has passed since the escape. Chloe approaches to stand with Nate, and enquires if he truly loves Elena, though it is clear she already knows the answer. Before he can reply, we see the reporter - still recovering from her injuries - walking towards them, supported by Sully.Chloe takes her leave with a word of advice: Just do yourself a favour, cowboy - tell her, and walks away. She cannot, however, resist a parting shot. But admit it, she calls playfully over her shoulder, You're gonna miss this ass.After lamenting the lack of any riches to show for their escapade, Sully sets off in pursuit of Chloe, much to Nate and Elena's amusement. The two stare out over the beautiful Himalayan panorama, and share a kiss. Elena asks, on a scale of ten, how scared Nate was that she would die.Four, Nate replies.Four? exclaims Elena. You were at least an eight.An eight? queries Nate, doubtfully. Those Guardian things were an eight.Elena is mock horrified, but curious: What's a ten?Clowns, confides Nate with a shrug.Clowns? Over my death? exclaims Elena in disbelief.I-I don't like clowns, Nate admits, with a trace of shame.The scene fades to black as the two bicker playfully.

title: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen
synopsis: In an unnamed war-torn European city in The Age of Reason, amid explosions and gunfire from a large Turkish army outside the city gates, a fanciful touring stage production of Baron Munchausen's life and adventures is taking place. In a theatre box, the mayor, The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson, reinforces the city's commitment to reason by ordering the execution of a soldier who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers and citizens.
Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the real Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht.
When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe's contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway.
The balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, who has grown younger, finds his old associate Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon, a giant with separate minds in his head and body, who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon. The death of the King's body, and a bungled escape from the Moon, brings the trio back to (and beneath) the Earth, where the Roman God Vulcan hosts his guests with courtesy and Albrecht is found. The Baron and Vulcan's wife, the Goddess Venus, attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in the air, but this cuts short the hospitality and Vulcan expels the foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas.
Swallowed by an enormous sea creature, the travellers locate Gustavus, Adolphus, and the Baron's trusty horse Bucephalus. The Baron (who again appears elderly after being expelled from a state of bliss) encounters the Angel of Death for the third time. Finally they escape by blowing a modicum of snuff out into the sea creature's cavernous interior, causing it to sneeze the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole. The Baron, young once again, sails to where the Turkish army is located but the Baron's associates are too elderly and tired to fight.
The Baron lectures them firmly but to no avail, and he storms off intending to surrender to the Sultan. His companions rally to save the Baron, and through a series of fantastic acts they rout the Turkish army and liberate the city. During the city's celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson and the Angel of Death appears a final time to take the Baron's life. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the Baron is telling to the same theater-goers in the city. The Baron calls the foregoing only one of the many occasions on which I met my death and closes his tale by saying everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after.
The Baron leads the citizens to the city gates to reveal the city has indeed been saved, though it is unclear if the events of the battle occurred in a story or in reality. Sally asks, It wasn't just a story, was it? The Baron grins, rides off on Bucephalus, and then disappears.

title: America's Got Talent
synopsis: Tuesday night brings a whopping three hours of America's Got Talent, including the final hour of auditions and a two-hour run through the Vegas round.First, 8-year-old Avery and the Calico Hearts, a singing trio, pile on the saccharin with a rendition of Justin Bieber's Baby. The judges all enjoy it, even Piers, but he doesn't want to send them through. Sharon and Howie's votes are good enough to keep the sweetness coming. They're going to Hollywood.A guy named Kevin Shelley says he's going to break 48 1-inch-thick pieces of wood with his head. He asks Nick to hand them to him one at a time, and the guy does it -- alarming fast. His head bleeds a bit, but he seems to have all his faculties. A medic stands by just in case, telling Nick, That's not right. Piers says that whenever people ask him what it's like to work with Howie Mandel, he's going to show them the video of what Kevin just did. Howie wants Kevin to come back and do something even more dangerous. It's a yes. Sharon says she can't see it in Vegas, and it's a no. Piers agrees with Howie. Kevin's in, and leaves with an ice pack on his forehead.Here comes the montage: Dezmond Meeks, a singer and pianist, riles the crowd with an old, sweet rendition of Georgia on My Mind; a juggler named Thomas John plays When the Saints Go Marching In with a ping pong ball and... yeah, this one you had to see; and a female singing quartet called 4Play (get it?) stuns the judges and crowd with a version of Beyonce's If I Were a Boy.J. Chris Newberg plays short funny songs. Piers doesn't find him particularly funny. Howie thinks he's a funny guy. Piers says he's great, except he's not funny. Howie's a yes, Piers is a no, and Sharon is a yes.King Diamond, is a 61-year-old blast from the past who looks like he just landed out of an episode of Shaft. He wants to entertain the world. It takes everyone a moment to figure out whether he's good or terrible. But once the it's clear he's terrible, he gets three X's quickly. Nick comes on stage to dance with King Diamond to smooth it all over.CUT (Chicago's Ultimate Tumblers) is led by a man who says the group's mission is to keep kids out of trouble. One of the girls who talks about how her coach is a mentor and father figure tears up as she tells the story. The girl becomes the focal point as her teammates are supposed to do flips over her off a small trampoline, and one of them jumps right into her. She's knocked sideways and gets up to get back in position -- and goes even higher. The rest of the act is completed without incident. Piers tells her it was just about the bravest thing he's ever seen. Howie wants to see it less raw and more polished, but votes yes. Piers loves them raw and sends them to Vegas.A guy who Howie says looks like Art Garfunkel (look him up, kids), goes on stage wearing nothing but a robe. He immediately threatens to disrobe. He eventually does, after pulling off a series of boxers and briefs. The crowd watches in amazement and disgust (in equal portions). All three judges dismiss the rather cheesy act.A montage of terrible acts, including a really bad opera singer, a guy who tells stories with balloons, and an awful 55-year-old pop singer, follows.A couple of old pals, 67 and 81, who met singing karaoke take the stage promising to show something we've never seen. The show is called Meet Me at Fairfax and Third. The 81-year-old plays piano and croons while his 67-year-old pal randomly does a headstand on a wooden chair and dances, upside down, to the music. The music is drowned out by the crowd's cheers. Piers calls it utterly ludicrous but that there's something horribly good about them. Howie loves it, saying that sometimes A and B are nothing, individually, but together this is what you get.That's it for the Season 6 auditions.SECOND PARTThe judges are on their way to Vegas -- or at least in a fancy tour bus going from the airport to the place where the auditions are being held. They have to decide who will perform on Day 1, who will wait for Day 2, and who will go home right away. There will be 48 spots in the next round.The judges welcome all the acts to Vegas. Piers asks 10 of them to stand up. He says the judges have agreed to send them home immediately -- because they've decided to put them straight through to Hollywood.They are:Silhouettes (Minneapolis)Squawk Opera (Minneapolis)Lys Agnes (Minneapolis)Professor Splash (Houston)The Rhinestone Ropers (Houston)The Fearless Flores Family (Houston)Melissa Villasenor (Seattle)Captain Stab-Tuggo and Maybelle (Atlanta)Team ILuminate (Atlanta)Miami All Stars (Atlanta)The remaining 38 spots will be determined in Vegas. The first day will feature the judges' favorite acts. They will have the first chance to make it to the next round. The rest of the acts are considered standbys and will only get a chance to make it if the favorites don't fill up the 38 spots.The acts are grouped together and first up is the Danger group.Juggler Charles Peachock ups the stakes, introducing fire to his act, going so far as to light his legs on fire while he juggles torches that are also ablaze.The judges are impressed. Next is Kevin Shelley, who broke all those boards over his head in Atlanta. This time, he's breaking concrete with his elbows and standing on swords while an assistant breaks concrete blocks on his back. But the blocks don't break. The Yellow Design Stunt Team -- a group of bike performers -- try to impress the judges. Frank Miles, who juggled stun guns, puts a knife into one of four styrofoam coolers. Then, asking Sharon to choose a cooler at random, he eliminates the coolers that don't have the knife in them by doing forward flips and breaking the coolers with his weight (if he lands on the knife, he's in big trouble and, in his words, definitely not going to Hollywood.) He nails it -- holding a fake bloody knife tip to his stomach for effect as he breaks the very last empty cooler.The next category is vocal groups. Mona Lisa give it their all, and 4Play are shocked with their own performance. They tells the judges the nerves got to them. The judges confer and send them home immediately.Next are the acrobats. Trapeze artists, tumblers and jump ropers go at it, and a couple of pole dancers -- a man and a woman -- fill out the group. Steven Retchless, the male pole dancer, wows the judges with an even better performance than he showed in the auditions. Soleil Rousseau, the woman, says she wants to prove that pole dancing is OK to do. She cries as she explains that her parents likely don't approve, but support her despite that. Howie asks her how she thought she compared to the other pole dancer. She says hers was more graceful and his was mostly strength.Next are the magicians. They're carefully watching each other. Fantastic Fig, 76, is back and the others are watching. Another magician says Figs card tricks aren't real magic. Michael Turco, who's been watching and knocking the others, runs into trouble with his illusion when a door gets stuck.The animal acts stumble, too, when some a dog has trouble jumping rope. The talking parrots face off. But this time they both struggle. Echo doesn't want to speak -- and doesn't even wave bye-bye. His owner quips that they aren't going to get bye-bye, and Howie suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, Vegas Birds has a parrot that paints -- or at least they think it does. Sharon asks the bird to paint a rose and the painting looks nothing like a rose. Backstage, Echo says, I don't like it. I'm going to fly.The classical singers are next, and Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr., is nervous because he isn't classically trained like his competitors. Cindy Chang is helping keep his nerves in check backstage. Cindy's audition doesn't go as well. She seems quite nervous and shaky. Howie says he didn't like it and Piers agrees it was a little bit off. The judges send her home immediately, and we have to listen to Coldplay, just in case we don't feel bad enough for her. Landau is devastated, but he won't try to fix her.The next group is the bands. The Fiddleheads are the first of the bands to really capture the judges' attention. Pop Lyte are the youngest band in the category. They promised to win Piers over with an electric set. The judges agree that they did step it up from the first audition.The dance acts are next, and Fatally Unique. Their human pyramid fell during rehearsal and one of the dancers was taken away in an ambulance with her neck stabilized. Another injured dancer is part of LD Dance, who has a severely twisted ankle. She goes on despite being in pain. Snap Boogie, who's been watching the other dances in awe, says he wishes he could do all that stuff. He's a street dancer and he shows the judges what he does best. Piers and Sharon love it. Fatally Unique's injured dancer comes back with a busted lip and fractured nose. They've altered the routine just enough to take the injured dancer out of the final stunt.The female singers are next. Dani Shay, the Justin Bieber look-alike, is nervous going up against great singers. She's going to do an original song, which Piers calls a massive risk. She stumbles halfway through her song and stops. She doesn't continue after stopping. The judges call her back, as they've done with the acts that they've sent home immediately. Sharon tells her that they need to hear her sing a well-known song. Asked if she's willing to do that, Dani says, OK.The comedians go next and they have trouble performing to a 7,000-seat arena that's empty, but for three judge. J. Chris Newberg, the guy who sings short, funny songs, does alright. Gichi Guy does his one-liner thing.Dani Shay is ready to come back and perform Trouble for the judges, which she says she just learned in a couple of hours.The novelty acts, who acknowledge they're just weirdos, include a drag queen who butchers a Tina Turner song. Those Funny Little People, the dancing gnomes, do a new routine with a female gnome in the mix. Piers seems to hate it, and so Howie has them come down to the judges table so he can get a picture with the gnomes standing around an annoyed Piers. The Kinetic King works up an elaborate domino-like set up with popsicle sticks and who knows what else, which took about six-to-eight hours to build and amazes the judges.The male singers bring their different styles, looks and sounds to the competition. Ryan Andreas wants it badly and seems to have his nerves more under control, but later says he's not super-happy with this performance. Dezmond Meeks, who's made a life out of random singing gigs, is hoping this one sticks.There's massive drama as the judges discuss all the acts and try to figure out who should stay and who should go.Coldplay's back, which means there's some bad news coming. People cry as they're sent home.Gichi Guy and J. Chris Newberg are in. Magician Scott Alexander is in. Charles Peachock, Frank Miles and Yellow Design Stunt Team are in. Pop Lyte and the Fiddleheads are in. Those Funny Little People and The Kinetic King are in. Echo makes it. Mona Lisa is in. Fatally Unique are in. Dezmond Meeks is in. Snap Boogie is in. Pole dancer Steven Retchless is in. Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr., is in. Zuma Zuma are in. Dani Shay is in.

title: Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel
synopsis: Three men walk into a bar; two geeks and a cynic.They are three ordinary blokes who all have dreams and hopes for an exciting and better future. They are stuck in boring jobs with no prospects. They are frustrated and life on the whole looks uneventful.They are about to sit down and have an average night out in their local pub, a few beers, a bit of banter and joking, and putting the world to rights. There is no reason to suspect anything unusual is going to happen.The first geek, Ray, has a well-known obsession with time travel, so when he is approached by Cassie, a woman who claims to be from the future, he naturally suspects a prank.The second geek, Toby, is obsessed with films, and upon hearing Ray's story of the woman from the future, naturally assumes that Ray is pitching him a film plot. And Pete, the cynic, naturally doesn't believe any of it, until he accidentally stumbles through a time leak into the future of the bar -- which happens to be full of dead people, including himself.This triggers the start of a series of accidental trips back and forth through time, during which our heroes frantically try to avoid multiple earlier versions of themselves, to avoid creating a time paradox, in an attempt to unravel the mystery of just who is trying to kill them and why.When Ray and Cassie get together in the garden and the world spins back on its axis, everything is back to how it should be. Or is it? When Ray mentions the other woman he met in the bar, Millie, to Cassie all hell breaks loose... Serious questions are raised, such as; exactly what are the golden rules of time travel? What exactly is a paradox? And what's really so bad about ceasing to exist? Whose round is it? Is the sell-by date on a packet of crisps really that important? And most importantly of all, can Ray get it on with Cassie, the woman from the future?British comedians Chris ODowd, Marc Wootton and Dean Lennox Kelly star with Anna Faris for Gareth Carrivick, making his feature directorial debut with a script from first time feature writer Jamie Mathieson.

title: The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1
synopsis: Breaking Dawn Part 1 opens over the Black home on the Quileute reservation. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) storms out of the house, dropping a formal invitation to the ground. Jacob's father, Billy (Gil Birmingham) wheels out after him, but Jacob phases into wolf form and races out into the pouring rain and the woods. Billy picks up the invitation: it's to Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) wedding. Both Bella's parents receive wedding invitations. It's clear that Charlie (Billy Burke) is not thrilled with the engagement and is probably still upset with Edward for breaking Bella's heart. Renee (Sarah Clarke), on the other hand, is excited and has obviously been expecting the engagement as she shares the invitation with her husband, Phil (Ty Olsson).It's the day before the wedding and the Cullens are preparing their estate for the wedding, all under the direction of Alice (Ashley Greene), who has placed herself in charge, down to the last detail. She sends Bella home for 'lots of beauty sleep,' but Bella sleeps poorly; first, just before she goes to bed, Edward goes to see her and tell her of a time shortly after he was turned, when he struck out on his own to hunt humans for blood (even though his conscience ensured he only killed men who murdered and victimized other people), as a warning against Bella becoming a vampire; and then Bella has a nightmare where the Volturi-- Aro (Michael Sheen), Marcus (Christopher Heyerdahl) and Caius (Jamie Campbell Bower)-- are standing before them in place of the minister, and then suddenly both Edward's tuxedo and Bella's dress are covered in blood as they stand before a pile of bodies -- all of the wedding guests.Bella must face Alice on the wedding day after not having slept, but Alice is pleased to see Rosalie (Nikki Reed) finally starting to warm to Bella as the finality of Bella's joining the Cullen family is finally upon them all. Bella's parents give her a sapphire-encrusted hair comb to wear in her hair, much to Alice's delight.Bella starts to have anxiety as Charlie starts to walk her down the aisle, but seeing Edward at the altar chases them away. Wedding vows are spoken and the new Mr. and Mrs. Cullen share a passionate kiss as all of the guests applaud. Among the wedding guests are Billy, Sue Clearwater (Alex Rice), and her son Seth (BooBoo Stewart) from the Quileute tribe, and Bella's old schoolmate quartet of Mike (Michael Welch), Jessica (Anna Kendrick), Angela (Christian Serratos) and Eric (Justin Chon).The reception is a little bumpier than Edward and Bella would have hoped-- while introducing Bella to the Denali clan, a small cousin-coven of 'vegetarian vampires' from Alaska, one of them, Irina (Maggie Grace) happens to see Seth and recognizes him as a wolf, and promptly becomes very upset-- Irina was in love with Laurent and is unwilling to believe that he tried to kill Bella, insisting that like all of them, he wanted to live in peace with humans, and with her. Jacob finally shows up much to Bella's delight, but when Jacob says he needed to see her one last time while she was still human, Bella carelessly mentions she will be staying human during her honeymoon. Knowing that Bella means she plans to consummate her marriage with Edward while still human, Jacob becomes furious, because he is sure Edward would kill Bella in the process. The rest of the Quileute pack must come out of the woods to pull Jacob away; Sam (Chaske Spencer) curtly telling Jacob that Bella is no longer their concern.For the honeymoon, Edward takes Bella to a small, private island off the coast of Brazil that Carlisle bought for Esme. Two native Ticuna, Kaure (Carolina Virguez) and her husband Gustavo (Sebastião Lemos) are caretakers of the small villa house on the island.Bella's pleasure and enjoyment from the honeymoon, including finally making love with Edward, are cut short when Edward fusses over how he inadvertently left a number of bruises about Bella's body. Frightened of touching her again, he spends most of their time playing chess with her. Bella dreams of finally winning a game against him and starting to kiss him. When she wakes she is in tears, and she begs Edward to try making love to her again.At LaPush beach on the Quileute lands, Jacob is sarcastic in his thoughts on how Bella's death would be announced to the public. Jacob tries to take some comfort in getting to kill Edward once the treaty was broken, but Sam (Chaske Spencer) reminds Jacob that he is still alpha wolf of the pack and decides when and if the treaty is broken. Sam is satisfied that the Cullens are not a threat to the tribe or the human populace.Leah (Julia Jones) thinks Jacob needs to get over Bella, as he hasn't imprinted on her. The mention of imprinting brings back Jacob's cynicism; looking at other pack mates and those they've imprinted on, he is sickened at the thought of no longer belonging to himself while his genes tell him he's happy about it. But Leah feels differently; imprinting would at least rid a pack member of a very real heartache.Bella gets an upset stomach while eating a weird meal (chicken, peanut butter, and yogurt) and has to throw up. Looking inside one of her bags, she spots her unopened box of tampons, and realizes her period is late. Going to the mirror, she is sure that her abdomen is bigger. Alice calls Edward at that moment, struck with concern because she suddenly became unable to see any more visions of Bella. Alice puts Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) on the phone and Bella tells him that she thinks she's pregnant -- suddenly wincing as if to prove her point; she's now sure she felt something move inside her. Carlisle tells Edward that he must bring Bella home immediately so Carlisle can examine her. But when Edward tells Bella that Carlisle will 'get that thing' out of her, Bella is struck with a protective streak, unable to imagine her unborn child being a 'thing.'On the way out, Kaure confronts them and is horrified. From her people's legends, she suspects the truth about Edward. Edward pleads with Kaure to tell him if there's anything he can do for Bella. Bella allows Kaure to put a hand on her stomach, and Kaure only says in her native tongue, 'death.'As Edward is seeing to the private plane's preparation for takeoff, Bella calls Rosalie, the one person she knows will be entirely on her side, for help in preventing the rest of the Cullens from terminating her pregnancy.Jacob arrives home and finds Charlie's police cruiser there. Inside the house, Charlie tells Jacob that Bella called, and that her voice sounded off. Jacob is sure that Bella is very ill and goes to the Cullen home for an explanation. Bella hears Jacob's voice and calls to him, showing that she's there. Jacob goes upstairs to find Rosalie standing in front of Bella like a protective mother bear. Bella's unborn child has grown alarmingly fast and she already looks well into her pregnancy-- and the rest of her body is beginning to look more emaciated; her cheeks and face sunken and sallow. Carlisle says the embryonic sac is too strong to be punctured by a probe needle and an ultrasound cannot see inside it. Alice can't see any visions of the baby, or Bella, either. The Cullens are researching legends of rumored vampire-human offspring but have nothing concrete, and they are divided-- Rosalie fiercely protecting Bella's desire to have her baby despite several of the other Cullens unsure whether the offspring can even be called a baby at all. Edward takes Jacob aside and confides in him that he is worried about Bella's life, asking Jacob if he can try and talk Bella out of carrying her baby full term. Edward says that if Bella refuses to relent, and the baby kills her as most of the Cullens fear, he gives Jacob permission to kill him.When Bella does not bend under Jacob's attempt at persuasion, he leaves the Cullen estate in a rage and races through the woods in wolf form. The rest of the pack converges with him at a lumber yard, all likewise in wolf form, and they all argue. All of the pack is furious at the news of Bella's pregnancy, convinced that the unborn offspring will be unable to control its thirst and will be a dangerous abomination that will endanger the pack and the town. Sam decrees that the unborn offspring must be destroyed before it is born, even if it means they must kill Bella, and fight through the whole Cullen clan to get at her. When Jacob rebels at the decree, Sam advances toward him, using his authority as alpha wolf to order Jacob to fight alongside them. All of the pack, who must obey Sam's direct orders, are forced to bow their heads in submission. But suddenly Jacob, struggling with all of his will, thrusts his lupine head back up and invokes his right as the grandson of Ephraim Black, last chief of the tribe, to refuse to follow Sam any further.Jacob races back to the Cullen home and warns Edward to 'get ready.' Jacob finds that Seth has followed him-- he's left the pack and chosen to follow Jacob. Leah has likewise left in order to watch over her little brother. Jacob insists he doesn't want them to follow him, but he refuses to give them a direct order as alpha wolf to make them go back. Leah says Sam doesn't know she and Seth left the pack, but no sooner does she finish saying so when they hear the howls of the pack, telling them that Sam does know now.Jacob tells the Cullens what he's learned from Leah: Sam knows he's lost the element of surprise, and with the pack down three members, he is now outnumbered. The Quileutes will therefore keep the home surrounded and wait for opportunities to pick off the Cullens when chance permits. However, the Cullens are all in need of hunting (their eyes have become black, showing their thirst).Jacob is on watch near the river when Leah joins him. Jacob doesn't trust Leah near the Cullens because she hates them. Leah promises to do whatever Jacob wants, except go back to Sam, the ex-lover she lost and can never have back. Although she is a wolf, as a female she doesn't quite fit in with the pack, and she desperately longs to imprint on anyone just to heal her broken heart.Jacob, Seth and Leah continue to guard the Cullen home. Esme comes out to bring them sandwiches. Meanwhile, Bella's unborn baby grows exceptionally fast, and her body continues to grow more emaciated; her cheeks more sunken; her skin and hair ashen. One of her ribs is broken, and Carlisle warns her that the baby is robbing her body of the nutrition it needs; starving her by the minute. He warns that the fetus is incompatible with her body and her heart will give out before she can deliver. Bella and Edward are pitted against each other; Bella is ready to die for her unborn baby and feels that Edward will have a son or daughter through which Bella's memory would live on. But Edward cannot accept the baby if Bella dies, and he didn't choose for her to leave him.Bella's body becomes gaunt and frail; she is barely able to stand, and cannot walk unaided. Carlisle hooks her up to an IV drip. Jacob attempts to warm her up with his body heat. Bella suddenly leans forward due to nausea, but she is unable to throw up since she hasn't eaten in quite some time. Reading a thought Jacob has, Edward realizes that Jacob might have the right idea: the baby is thirsting for blood. Carlisle has some O negative human blood from the hospital's blood bank stored away. Bella drinks some and starts to feel better; her pulse immediately improving.Edward is bringing Bella another cup of blood and interrupts Bella's conversation with Charlie. Bella tells Charlie that she is better but she's going to a medical center in Switzerland. This upsets Charlie very much as he hasn't seen Bella since the wedding. Bella hangs up and becomes upset. Edward apologizes to her as he didn't realize how difficult this was for Bella. He realizes he's left her alone through this. Suddenly, he hears a voice he doesn't recognize. He realizes it's coming from the baby. Putting a hand on Bella's stomach, he realizes he can hear the baby's thoughts. The baby's heart is pure and good, like Bella's, and it loves both of them. Edward now wants to see the baby safely born as well.The baby is close to delivery, and Carlisle needs to be at his strongest. He and Esme must hunt. Emmett will go with them, but Sam still won't hesitate to go after them so that Bella will have fewer protectors. When Esme firmly tells Jacob that she and Carlisle are ready to lay down their lives for Bella, Jacob understands that the Cullens are a family as close-knit as his own. He knows what he must do.Jacob goes out into the woods and calls for a truce to speak with the pack. Paul (Alex Meraz), Embry (Kiowa Gordon), Quil (Tyson Houseman) and Jared (Bronson Pelletier) confront him. Jacob tells them that he wants Sam to take Leah and Seth back, and that when the baby is born, Jacob will personally destroy it-- he alone has the trust of the Cullens and the opening to do so.Carlisle, Esme, and Emmett rush out into the woods, pursued by Sam and another pack member. The two wolves take Esme down and are about to kill her when Emmett grabs her up and gets her to safety across a river gorge. Sam's howl alerts Paul that Jacob's truce was a ruse to split the pack up so that the Cullens could escape from them.Back in the Cullen home, Rosalie gets Bella to tell Jacob and Edward the names she's picked for the baby. If the baby is male, Bella will name him EJ, for Edward Jacob. If the baby is a girl, she'll be named Renesmee; after both Renée and Esme.As Rosalie hands Bella a cup of blood for her to drink, the cup drops and Bella instinctively tries to bend over to catch it. Her back suddenly breaks; she falls to her knees and one knee breaks. She's gone into labor. The placenta has detached and the baby will die unless taken out of her body immediately. Rosalie has to cut an incision in Bella's body for an emergency C-section before a morphine shot given as an anesthetic can take effect. But as she makes the incision, Rosalie is overwhelmed with blood-thirst and Jacob and Alice must pull her out of the room. Bella cannot be changed until the baby comes out, but it appears the baby will destroy Bella from the inside out before it happens. Desperate, Edward uses his teeth to finish the incision and extracts the baby. The baby is a girl. He shows her to Bella and calls her Renesmee.Bella smiles at her baby daughter as Edward puts Renesmee gently on her chest. The weight of the baby crushes Bella's fragile chest and suddenly her face and eyes go vacant. Both Jacob and Edward think she's dead. Edward passes Renesmee to a recovered Rosalie and works feverishly with Jacob to try and revive Bella. He takes a syringe filled with his venom and injects it straight into Bella's heart. But all their efforts are seemingly unsuccessful. Jacob tells Edward that instead of killing him, Jacob will let him live with his guilt. He then goes outside, sits on the ground and begins to cry. Seth realizes Bella didn't make it. From the edge of the woods, Paul, in wolf form, is watching.Edward continues to struggle to revive Bella, biting her several times to inject more venom, refusing to believe that she is truly dead. Back on the Quileute lands, Sam is telling Billy that even if Jacob is his son, he's betrayed the pack. Paul comes up and whispers something to Sam. Sam tells everyone that Bella is dead, and the baby killed her. He gives a curt order for the pack to follow; they're going to war.At that moment Jacob has decided that he will take revenge of his own for the loss of Bella. He stalks back into the house to kill Renesmee. Rosalie, absorbed in cuddling and playing with the baby, does not notice as he creeps up behind her. But Rosalie happens to lift Renesmee up to where the baby can look over Rosalie's shoulder. Baby Renesmee's eyes meet Jacob's and he freezes. Jacob imprints on Renesmee, seeing her future as a beautiful and gentle girl. Her future becomes his; he is now bound to become anything she might need; a brother, a friend, a protector.Sam and the pack arrive at the Cullen home. Rosalie is caring for Renesmee so only Edward, Alice and Jasper can defend the house, and now Sam has the numbers advantage, seven to three since Emmett, Carlisle, and Esme have not yet returned. Sam personally rushes to strike down Edward. Sam is ready to finish Edward when Carlisle, Esme and Emmett, revitalized, arrive back at the house to defend their family. Leah rushes out and saves Alice, and Seth follows behind her. The numbers are now just shy of even, but Sam and the pack are fighting to kill, while the Cullens, and Leah and Seth, are merely trying to ward the pack off.The standoff is ended when Jacob comes out to tell Sam that if he kills Renesmee, he also kills Jacob. Jacob phases into wolf form, advancing and snarling, and all of the wolves back away -- even Sam. Reading Jacob's thoughts, Edward tells the pack and the Cullens that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee which means that the pack cannot harm her-- it's their most absolute law. The wolves back off and leave, respecting Jacob's new mate.The Cullens clean and dress Bella's body, and Carlisle points out to Edward that Bella's heart is still beating, but she is immobile because of the morphine having took effect while she was in labor. All they can do is wait. Finally the venom kicks in; the bite marks disappear from Bella's flesh, her bones mend together, her cheeks and limbs fill out as her body regains its healthy appearance. Bella's heart stops beating and her skin turns pale. During the healing process, memories of Bella's childhood to adulthood are shown with the last memory being a happy Charlie and Renee holding a smiling Bella in front of a mirror. The camera pans in to show Bella's eyes as they suddenly open to reveal a crimson red color. Bella is now a newborn vampire.Partway through the credits is a final scene where the Volturi receptionist, Bianca, is delivering a formal announcement to Aro. Aro reads the announcement, which informs them that Bella has been changed and is Edward's wife. Marcus and Caius believe that the dispute with the Cullens is now over, but Aro scoffs at this; the dispute goes far beyond a single human. The Cullens have something that Aro wants.

title: The Shining
synopsis: Former teacher and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) interviews for a caretaker job at the Overlook Hotel in an effort to rebuild his life after his volatile temper lost him his teaching position. The hotel manager, Mr. Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson), warns Jack that he and his family will be snowbound through most of the winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever. He drives the point home by recounting a season when the caretaker, Charles Grady, went crazy and brutaly killed his wife, his two girls (Lisa Burns and Louise Burns), and finally himself. Given his own desperation and the opportunity to pursue his true passion, writing, Jack acknowledges the warning, but accepts the job.Meanwhile, Jack's son Danny (Danny Lloyd) has a seizure while talking to his imaginary friend Tony about the Overlook Hotel. He has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel, an image which is revisited several times throughout the film.Upon Danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) recognizes that Danny is telepathic, and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. He explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as shining. He also counsels Danny about the hotel, hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace, as if someone burned toast, which only people who can shine will perceive. Danny questions Dick about what went on in the hotel, and about Room 237 in particular as Danny can sense that Dick is especially afraid of that room. Though he strives to assure Danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just like pictures in a book and can't hurt him, Dick sternly warns Danny to stay out of that room.Jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. He has writer's block, sleeps too little, and is irritable. Danny has visions of the two murdered Grady girls, but tells no one. He continues to wonder about Room 237.While the weather is still relatively warm, Jack's wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and Danny walk through a maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it, stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes.One day, a ball rolls toward Danny as he plays with his toys. It appears to have come from the open door of Room 237, which Danny enters. At that moment, Wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of Jack's screams in the lounge. He tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop Danny and her to pieces. As a disconcerted Wendy promises that Everything's gonna be okay, Danny appears at the other end of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. His sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. He does not answer when Wendy asks what happened. She angrily accuses Jack of hurting Danny and takes the child back to their suite.Jack is furious about the accusation. He storms around the hotel, making his way to the Gold Ballroom. Sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands, Jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. When he looks up he discovers a bartender (Joe Turkel), who serves him a drink. Jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name, Lloyd. In the course of telling his troubles to Lloyd, Jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated Danny's shoulder, the same accident Wendy mentioned to Danny's pediatrician earlier. Notably, Jack states that the injury happened three years ago, while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician, Wendy said that Jack, who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident, has currently been sober for only five months.A frantic Wendy enters, finding Jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate Danny's claim that a crazy woman attacked him in the bathtub of Room 237. Jack, who acts a bit tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look.As Jack approaches the door to Room 237, Danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. Dick, back at his home in Florida, stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal Danny is sending.Jack cautiously enters Room 237. The bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. He watches lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman (Lia Beldam) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. The two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. Jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. He recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman (Billie Gibson); a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin. She cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. Stunned, Jack staggers out of the room, locking the door after him.When he reports back to Wendy, Jack denies anything amiss in Room 237. Wendy suggests they take Danny to a doctor. Jack becomes irate, lecturing Wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. Insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers, he storms out, returning to the Gold Room, which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. Lloyd serves him a drink and Jack strolls through the crowd. He doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling advocaat on his jacket. The butler convinces Jack to come into the bathroom to clean up.The butler introduces himself as Delbert Grady (Philip Stone). Jack remembers the story Mr. Ullman told him about a former caretaker named Grady murdering his family and confronts Grady with the information. Grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that Jack has always been the caretaker. Jack is confused, but seems to accept Grady's story. Grady goes on to tell Jack that Danny has a great talent and is using it to bring an outside party into the situation, referring to Dick Halloran with a racial slur. Grady advises Jack on how to correct Danny, and how to deal with Wendy if she interferes.Back in Florida, Dick has had no luck contacting the people at the Overlook Hotel. Worried about Danny, he books the next flight to Colorado.At the Overlook, Wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for Jack, intent on leaving the hotel with Danny whether or not Jack agrees to come. Entering the lounge, she spots Jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. She reads what Jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. She realizes that Jack has gone mad.Jack approaches from behind and asks sarcastically, How do you like it? Wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. A confrontation ensues as Jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with Danny, while Wendy retreats, brandishing the bat. She screams at Jack not to hurt her, and he swears that he will not; instead, he intends to kill her. Wendy hits Jack on the head with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs, causing him to lose his balance and tumble down the staircase, injuring his ankle in the process.Wendy drags Jack's limp body to the pantry and locks him inside, just as he regains consciousness. Jack tells her he has sabotaged the radio, as well as the snow cat, stranding them all there. She goes outside to check on the snow cat, and confirms what he told her.A few hours later, Jack is roused from a nap by the sound of Delbert Grady's voice. Grady expresses disappointment and a lack of confidence in Jack, but Jack assures him he can get the job done if given one more chance. The pantry door then suddenly unlocks.Wendy has fallen asleep in her room. Danny is in a trance, carrying a knife and muttering redrum repeatedly. He takes Wendy's lipstick and writes REDRUM on the bathroom door. He begins shouting REDRUM, which wakes Wendy. She clutches him to her, then sees the reflection of the bathroom door in the mirror. Reversed, it reads: MURDER. At that instant, banging sounds start coming from the door to the hallway.The sound is Jack swinging an axe at the locked door. Wendy grabs Danny and locks them in the bathroom. She opens a tiny, snow banked window and pushes Danny out; he slides safely to the ground. She tries to get out the same window, but cannot fit. She tells Danny to run and hide.Meanwhile, Jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out Wendy, I'm home! Jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. Wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as Jack begins chopping into the door. After chopping away one of the panels, he sticks his head through and screams Heeeere's JOHNNY! (a reference to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson). Jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. Wendy slashes at him with a knife, cutting Jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. Jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. He stalks out.The snow cat driver is Dick. Inside the hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. Jack, hiding behind a pillar, leaps out and swings the axe into Dick's chest, killing him. Danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams, revealing his location. He clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside.Meanwhile, Wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for Danny. The hotel has sprung to life and now even Wendy encounters its ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. At the same time, axe-wielding Jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows Danny into the hedge maze.Danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for Jack to follow. He carefully retraces his steps, walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction, then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. When Jack arrives, he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue as to which direction Danny took. He chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. Danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance.Wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as Danny emerges from the maze. Relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces him. Jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. Danny and Wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that Dick used to get to the hotel. Jack, hopelessly lost in the maze, freezes to death.Right before the end credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. An old recording of Midnight, the Stars and You echoes in the empty hallway. In the center of one picture is a young Jack. The caption reads, Overlook Hotel, July 4th Ball, 1921.

title: Cliffhanger
synopsis: As the movie opens, we see a guy climbing along the underside of an outcropping from a tall mountain peak. He turns out to be Gabe Walker, a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue. (Yes, that makes him Ranger Walker, and he is addressed as such several times during the course of the movie.) He is in communication with his co-worker and girlfriend, Jessie, who is on a chopper piloted by an older co-worker, Frank. The three are mounting a rescue of yet another co-worker, Hal Tucker, and his girlfriend Sarah, who is on her first climb. Hal and Sarah made it to the top of the mountain, but Hal has aggravated an old knee injury and can't make it back down.Gabe makes it to the top of the peak where Hal and Sarah are. The chopper drops Gabe a cable, which he secures, while the chopper lands on a nearby peak. All is set for the three to shuttle across the cable to where the chopper is. There is a lot of light-hearted banter as this is a routine operation that they all (except Sarah) do all the time. Hal goes first, and as he is crossing, Gabe asks Sarah how Hal persuaded her to accompany him on this escapade. She replies laconically, He told me it's better than sex.Hal makes it across and now it's Sarah's turn. She is a little frightened at the thought of hanging from a cable 4,000 feet above the ground, but the fact that Hal crossed without incident is reassuring. Halfway across her equipment fails and suddenly she is hanging by a strap and unable to reach and grab onto the cable. Gabe quickly crosses to her and grabs her arm just as the strap breaks free. But they are unable to keep their grip on each other, and Sarah falls 4,000 feet to her death. This is by far the most dramatic and gripping scene in the movie and some viewers will be haunted by it for weeks afterwards. But really, except for providing some background for the interpersonal dynamics among the remaining characters, it has nothing to do with the plot of the rest of the movie.Fast forward eight months, and we pick up two different plot lines that will converge later. At the U.S. Treasury office in Denver, Treasury Agent Travers is preparing to leave on a flight with several large containers of printed currency totaling $100,000,000. His boss introduces FBI Agent Matheson, who is being transferred and is bumming a ride on the flight. Gabe, meanwhile, drives up to Jessie's (and formerly his) house. He had left after Sarah's funeral because he felt he had to get away, and has been working in Denver. He wants Jessie to come to Denver with him, but she won't. She leaves for work, leaving Gabe to get his stuff from the house and load it into his vehicle.On the plane, Matheson looks out his window and sees another plane flying next to them. He quickly and correctly sizes up the situation, informs the other two Treasury agents that Travers intends to hijack the plane, and pulls his gun on Travers. The other two agents dutifully pull their guns on Matheson, as does Travers. Travers shoots the other two agents, then shoots Matheson. In the cockpit, the co-pilot comments about the gunfire, and the pilot shoots him. The two planes move into position and run a cable between them. Travers transfers over, then the pilot sends the containers.But Matheson isn't dead. He manages to shoot the pilot, shoot the cable in enough places that it detaches from both planes and the containers fall to the ground, and shoot the other plane enough times that it crashes in the mountains, before his own plane explodes from explosives previously set by Travers. Kristel, the pilot of the other plane, radios for help, reaches Jessie, Hal, and Frank, tells them they are hikers who got lost in a snowstorm, and asks them to send a chopper. But they can't send a chopper because of the storm, so Hal sets off to climb to their location.Jessie goes back to the house and tries to persuade Gabe to help Hal, but Gabe makes some excuses about not having climbed in so long and drives away. Meanwhile in Denver, Treasury agents are discussing the fate of their plane, when some FBI agents arrive and inform them that Matheson wasn't just along for the ride, he was investigating. Seems that one Eric Qualen, a former military intelligence guy, has been plotting to hijack one of these Treasury shipments. Although the bills are in denominations that aren't distributed and therefore wouldn't have any value to the ordinary thief, Qualen has the international connections to dispose of these bills profitably. FBI shows Treasury, and us, Qualen's picture, and sure enough, it's the head bad guy from the second plane.We now find Gabe, who apparently has reconsidered since talking with Jessie, climbing up the side of a cliff. At a level point halfway up he meets up with Hal (who still blames Gabe for Sarah's death and isn't particularly thrilled to see him), and they climb to the top, where they are captured by Qualen's party. The three money containers have tracking devices, and Qualen intends for Hal and Gabe to guide them to each of the three locations. They reach a point several hundred feet below the first one and send Gabe up to get it. Qualen insists that Gabe leave his coat behind, a demand that serves no apparent purpose except to uncover Stallone's muscular biceps for a portion of the movie. When Hal warns Gabe the bad guys plan to kill him when he comes down, the bad guys start shooting at Gabe. This only triggers a snowslide that sweeps one of the bad guys over the cliff and... well, you know. The snowslide also sweeps the money container over the edge, where it pops open and sends $33.33 million worth of bills floating through the air and down into the valley below.Meanwhile Jessie, having grown suspicious over inconsistencies in Hal's radio communication, has Frank drop her off up in the mountains, where she meets up with Gabe. They manage to reach the second container before the bad guys, who arrive to find not the money but a note offering to trade the money for Hal. Qualen realizes it's Gabe and, night having fallen, sends a bad guy out with night vision goggles. This guy finds Gabe and Jessie, but Gabe temporarily blinds him by shooting a flare in his night-vision-sensitive face. The two wrestle and end up sliding down what is literally a slippery slope. At the last second Gabe is able to anchor himself while his adversary goes over the edge and... well, you know. Watching all this from his higher vantage point, Hal comments, Gravity's a bitch, isn't it? The bad guys fail to see the humor.It being night on a snowy mountain, Gabe and Jessie use the money to make a fire, Gabe commenting on how expensive it is to heat the place. Come daybreak, they try to reach the third container before Qualen's group, but their way is blocked by a series of explosions set off by Qualen. One of the bad guys corners them in a cave that was part of their shortcut, but Gabe is able to kill him by impaling him on a stalactite or stalagmite, I can never remember which is which, but this is the kind that comes down from the ceiling and Gabe has to push him up; you get the picture. There is also a scene where a rope breaks and Gabe ends up holding on to the side of a cliff with one hand and Jessie with the other. There is a close-up of their hands holding onto each other that looks very much like Gabe and Sarah's hands at the beginning, but they manage to maintain their grip until Gabe pulls Jessie to safety.Meanwhile the Qualen group encounters a couple of Bill and Ted wannabes and starts shooting at them, killing one and wounding the other as he parachutes off a ledge. Frank finds the survivor and decides he'd better find out what is going on. He soon discovers the Qualen party and lands the chopper in order to rescue them, only to be shot and killed for his trouble. At this point, Travers wants to forget the money and just get away in the chopper. Qualen demands the tracking device, which Tranvers gives him, but he refuses to tell him the passcode (knowing that if Qualen knew the passcode he'd have no need to keep Travers alive). Travers pulls a gun on Qualen, but Qualen comments that they can't use the chopper without a pilot, shoots and kills his pilot Kristel (who is apparently in love with him; Qualen tells her that the essence of love is sacrifice as he pulls the trigger), and observes that now he is the only one left who can fly the chopper. He orders Travers to take his tracking device and go find the money and bring it back to the chopper. Travers sets off with Hal and the only other remaining bad guy (the one who just shot Frank).Gabe sends Jessie back for help and sets off to find the last container, getting there before Travers and stuffing the money in his backpack. When Travers realizes he is close and doesn't need a guide anymore, he tells his companion to kill Hal, but Hal manages to kill him first. Travers sees his companion's body sailing down from the ledge and thinks it's Hal, although it doesn't seem to phase him that he never sees either of them again. His tracking device leads him to a rabbit wearing the device from the last container. Travers, a bureaucrat who has watched a seemingly foolproof plan completely unravel, is by now essentially insane. He begins erratically shooting at the rabbit, repeatedly missing it even at close range.Travers radios that he is going to look for Gabe, alarming Qualen by revealing information about their identities that might be of interest to searchers. Qualen, concerned that someone might have located the origin of the transmission, takes off in the chopper. Travers finds Gabe (or vice versa, it's hard to tell) on a wooden bridge over a mountain stream, and in the struggle that follows, Gabe falls through the ice and into the freezing cold water, which is nonetheless warm enough that he feels the need to take his shirt off and expose his physique once again. Travers spots Gabe under the ice trying to break through to the surface and draws his gun, but Gabe draws his own gun and fires through the ice, killing Travers. Hal shows up and helps Gabe out of the icy water.Jessie sees the chopper and, thinking that it is Frank, waves for help. Qualen captures her and radios Gabe and Hal that he has her, demands the money, and they agree on a rendezvous point. At the rendezvous, Qualen demands that Gabe throw the money into the chopper or he'll shoot Jessie, but Gabe says that if he does he'll throw the money over the cliff. Qualen relents and drops Jessie off nearby and returns for the money, but Gabe throws it into the chopper blades, and as Qualen struggles to regain control, Gabe attaches the chopper's winch to the top of a metal ladder running down the side of the mountain, while Hal shoots at the chopper until it loses power and falls. It pulls the top part of the ladder off of its attachments and ends up dangling on the side of the cliff. Gabe, who had taken refuge on the ladder to avoid Qualen's gunfire, falls and lands on the chopper, where he and Qualen engage in a fistfight.As you watch the gray-haired Qualen tangle with the Rocky-Balboa-like Gabe and wonder how it's possible that Qualen isn't having the living crap kicked out of him, you'll need to remind yourself that (a) John Lithgow and Sylvester Stallone are actually less than a year apart in age and (b) Qualen is former military intelligence while Gabe is just a hokey park ranger. But he's a hokey park ranger who can scale the side of a perfectly vertical cliff. As the rest of the ladder gives way, Gabe jumps off and grasps the side of the cliff, while the chopper, with Qualen in it, falls 4,000 feet and explodes on impact.Hal and Jessie toss Gabe a rope and help him to the top. They are then contacted by Treasury agents in a chopper, who have been monitoring radio communications for the last little while. They tell the trio that they will be back to pick them up shortly. The movie ends with Gabe, Hal, and Jessie sitting on top of a mountain peak, looking very much like Gabe, Hal, and Sarah at the beginning.

title: The Stöned Age
synopsis: In the opening scene, Crump's brother is hitchhiking on a busy highway. After a few cars pass him by, Crump's brother recognizes and yells at a long-haired teen in an old Ford pickup who screeches to a stop to pick him up. Crump's brother is obviously a tough guy. He tells the driver about two girls he knows about in Torrance Beach that he's planning to spend the night with. Later that day at Petro Park, a hangout in Orange County, the driver of the pickup tells some other dudes (known as the guzzlers), about the two girls. Tack, one of the guzzlers, walks away from the others, obviously on some sort of mission. We can only wonder what he's up to as the opening credits roll.During the title sequence we meet Joe (Michael Kopelow) and Hubbs (Bradford Tatum), two typical long-haired teens who are bombing around in their 1960s Volkswagen Type II Squareback, The Blue Torpedo. They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of Hocus Pocus by Focus is eaten by the tape deck. He then puts on Don't Fear The Reaper by Blue Öyster Cult, but Hubbs calls it a pussy song and orders him to take it out. Joe counters by saying: If it's B.O.C. how can it be pussy?, but Hubbs doesn't want to hear it, and grabs Joe in a headlock until he complies.They make a stop to chat up the homely Buffalo Chicks and get the lowdown on the evening's parties. Then, cruising once again, they pass Tack, (played by Clifton Collins Jr. in one of his first film roles), who's trying to flag them down. Joe, at the urging of Hubbs, spits a loogey on Tack as Tack yells out I got some chicks, man!. Hubbs shouts: Tack's got some chicks? and screeches to a halt to find out more. After failing to get Tack to reveal what he knows about the chicks, they reluctantly let him into the car. That's when Tack reveals that he has a shitload of fine chicks staying near that Frankie Avalon place down in Torrance Beach. Since Torrance Beach is some distance away, they then argue about money and gas. Hubbs yells: Information without transportation equals dick! If it weren't for us you'd still be sitting in the road jerking off! He then punches Tack and gets him to give up his weekend beer money.After stopping for gas and cigarettes, Hubbs and Joe talk to Crump, the gas station attendant. Crump tells them about two radical chicks his brother has down in Torrance Beach near that Frankie Avalon place. He then tells them that it's a closed party because there are only two chicks there. Hubbs, knowing now that Tack lied, tells Crump that a babe named Desiree Gibson, whom Crump's brother likes, is doing amateur night at Dirty Dougs', a strip club down the coast, hoping to divert both Crumps away from the chicks in Torrance Beach.Hubbs then gets back into the Blue Torpedo and tells Tack to get out and wash the windows. Tack argues, saying he bought the gas, but Hubbs is adamant: If I'm gonna haul your ass down there I'm gonna need clean windows. Tack gives in, gets out, and heads off to get a squeegee. But Joe hops in the car and they zoom off, ditching Tack. Knowing he's been duped, Tack chases after them and grabs onto the open window, begging Joe and Hubbs not to worm him out of the deal. But Hubbs punches Tack in the face and sends him sprawling across the parking lot as the Blue Torpedo squeals around the corner and out of sight.Soon, Hubbs and Joe arrive at a house in Torrance Beach and spy a sexy silhouette in a second-floor window. When they knock on the door, they meet the very sexy Lanie (Renee Ammann). Lanie grills them on drugs (they have none) and won't let them in unless they come back with a bottle of 151. So Hubbs and Joe head off to Liquor World, manage to sneak a bottle of 151 past the crazy disco clerk (played in a star cameo by Taylor Negron), Officer Dean and his partner, two inept Barney Fife-ish cops, and head back to Lanie's place to party.Across town, Tack needs another ride, and calls up Norm Snot-rag Hankey. But Snot-rag wants to watch his favorite TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard(!). But Tack replies: You wanna watch the fuckin' 'Dukes of Hazzard instead of getting laid?? I'm comin' over, man! So Tack shows up at the Hankey household and soon convinces Mrs. Hankey to let her son go cruising with Tack. Tack drives, screeching out of the driveway in a hurry to catch up with Joe and Hubbs.Meanwhile, Joe and Hubbs have returned to Lanie's house only to be met by the owner's daughter, Jill (played by China Kantner, who has a cute, slightly husky voice she may have inherited from her mom). If they are disappointed by her average looks, she is equally unimpressed by them (You guys must be looking for the homeless sponge-bath party. It's two doors down). But the bottle of 151 gains them entrance to the house. After drinking and listening to some rock music with Lanie and Jill, Joe mentions that Lanie looks just like that chick from the Virgin Killer album). They then discuss concerts, and Joe talks about being hit by a laser at a Blue Öyster Cult show and seeing a huge gnarly eyeball staring right at him. The girls look at Joe with concern, and Hubbs berates him later for being such a space case (You're blowin' it, dude!).The girls take a quick bathroom break, and Lanie tells Jill she thinks Hubbs looks like Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple, and tries to get Jill to go for Joe, an idea Jill immediately laughs off. Meanwhile, Joe and Hubbs are busy urinating in the ice cube tray and raiding her dad's kitchen for snacks. Soon, there's a knock on Jill's door; as Tack and Snot-rag arrive. After a brief struggle for dominance, Tack reveals that there's a party in Palos Verdes. When the girls look intrigued, Hubbs protests, saying: C'mon, you don't wanna party with a bunch of Palos Verdes rich kids, do you?. But of course, they do.So next we see the group being driven in Hanky's Camaro by Tack, wildly. When they arrive in P.V., Muldoon, the rich-boy host (played by Jake Busey), lets the girls in to the party but slams the door on the guys. Disappointed, they skulk around back and find the Petro Park Guzzlers drinking from kegs in Muldoon's back yard with the Buffalo Chicks. Joe, frustrated that he lost his chance to party, looks for a way in, but gets flipped off by Muldoon.Then, Joe gets a break. From the patio, he witnesses Lanie slap Muldoon across the face. When she comes outside, she asks Joe: What does someone have to do to get some drugs in this city? That's when Joe reveals that he has some marjiuana back in the Torpedo. Lanie, excited at the prospect, is ready to book right then, but Joe, ever the nice guy, is wary about ditching his buddy Hubbs. However, when Lanie offers to show him her new bikini, it's an offer he can't refuse, and soon they're getting high in Jill's neighbor's pool. Meanwhile, Hubbs, pissed that he can't find Joe or Lanie, flees the scene angrily with Jill, just as the party is about to be broken up by Officer Dean and the LAPD.Soon Lanie realizes Joe's stash is nothing but skank weed, and she's pissed. Worse, all of a sudden Hubbs arrives, grabs Joe in a headlock and warns him not to ditch him again. Joe is forced to watch Hubbs make out with Lanie, but he gets jealous and starts tossing furniture into the pool. When Hubbs and Lanie join in the infectious fun, the homeowner hears them and comes out of the house carrying a baseball bat. Luckily for Joe he swings wide, falling into the pool and allowing the three to make a break for it. They arrive home out of breath and laughing. Joe follows Lanie upstairs where he finally makes his move on her, but she effortlessly drops him to the floor, warning him to keep his hands off. Hubbs laughs at Joe, but later commends his actions.Meanwhile Tack and the Guzzlers, after a lecture by Officer Dean on teen drinking (and having their kegs confiscated), rally and decide to head to the chicks' house, after first stopping off at a liquor warehouse for supplies.Soon we see the carnage that follows Crumps brother's angry realization that he's been had at Dirty Doug's. He's off to find his chicks! Meanwhile, back in Torrance Beach, Hubbs has has scored with Lanie. At the same time Joe and Jill are arguing downstairs, and Jill stalks out and down to the beach. Joe catches up with her and they continue to talk, trying to make sense of their lives, which consist mostly of drinking, dating and getting stoned. Jill leaves Joe on the beach, where he sees the moon morph into a huge gnarly eyeball.When they return to the house, they find Tack and the horny gang of Guzzlers chanting: alcohol! and marching with cases of Ox 45 (talls, of course) that they stole from a liquor warehouse. There's a confrontation at the front door, where Tack calls Jill a fuckin' fat-ass and the Guzzlers gang up on Joe when he tries to defend her honor. Grateful, Jill helps Joe back into the house after he subdues Tack, and they end up (maybe) getting high off of Joe's skank weed stash and listening to music while the Guzzlers camp out impatiently on the front porch and Hubbs makes hay with Lanie upstairs. After Jill heads off for a bathroom break, Joe gets nauseated from the Ox 45 and skank weed mix and horks under a chair cushion and passes out.When Joe comes to, he and Jill discuss Blue Öyster Cult and Don't Fear The Reaper being a pussy song. Just then, he's beckoned upstairs by Hubbs. Hubbs tells him that he lied to Lanie about Joe's bad luck, and Lanie has agreed to have sex with him! But when Joe enters the room, he finds Lanie sleeping (nude) on the bed. Watching her sleep, he thinks again about being hit by the laser at the Blue Öyster Cult show; daydreams about his life as a stoner; and envisions his eventual death as nothing but a stoner(all in an inspired tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey) that even Stanley Kubrick might have enjoyed! When Joe comes out of his reverie, he decides it's not right to take advantage of Lanie, so he heads back downstairs, only to find Hubbs making out with Jill on the couch. Joe, jealous once again, interrupts them. Hubbs says it was all Jill's doing (something she doesn't deny).Then the trio hears a commotion outside. Crump's brother has shown up, and he's pushing around the Petro Park Guzzlers and trying to get inside the house by angrily thrashing the door. Joe and Hubbs are able to hold him off for a while, but eventually they flee to the kitchen, resigned to getting beat up by Crump's brother. But just when it looks like he is about to get inside, the yelling stops. Outside, Jill's father Warren (played by David Groh) can be seen knocking out Crumps Brother, and everyone else!Hubbs and Joe are celebrating their good luck --too early as it turns out-- as Warren enters his home, demanding to know who they are. Hubbs flees, but Joe is caught! Warren tosses Joe down the stairs and calls the police. After hearing the typical grownup lecture about all that stinking heavy metal music, Joe has finally had enough! He stands up for Jill, Lanie, and himself, then makes his escape just in time through a window that Hubbs breaks.As the duo sneaks away, they see Officer Dean and the LAPD arresting Tack, the Guzzlers, and Crumps Brother. As Joe and Hubbs make tracks, Jill stops Joe in the back yard and asks why he didn't go for her. He replies: I was working up to it! Not needing a second invitation, he kisses her and asks for her last name so he can look her up afterwards. But her name is unpronounceable, so we know they'll probably never meet again.Safely back in the Blue Torpedo, Hubbs calls Joe a pussy for not jumping on the grenade with Lanie when he had the chance. But by now Joe is feeling envy and jealousy too, and hits Hubbs. Hubbs responds forcefully enough, but when Hubbs calls Jill a fat-ass, Joe has finally had enough. He grabs Hubbs in a headlock and tells him to take it back! Hubbs finally relents and Joe, relishing his new-found power, calmly shoves his favorite song, Don't Fear The Reaper back into the 8-track. Hubbs looks like he wants to say it's a pussy song again, but this time, he thinks better of it, and rides along in silence. Joe has won.As Joe drives away in the Blue Torpedo, he sees the huge gnarly eyeball following him in the rear view mirror. Then it flies away, as the strains of Don't Fear The Reaper swells the soundtrack into the closing credits (and a cameo of two Blue Oyster Cult members themselves!). We are then reassured (as if we had any doubts) that No Chicks Were Harmed In The Making Of This Film.

title: Scream 4
synopsis: Sherrie and Trudie (Lucy Hale and Shenae Grimes), two high schools girls, are stalked and then brutally killed by Ghostface, but this is the opening scene to Stab 6, which Rachel and Chloe (Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell) are watching. Rachel nags on about horror movie cliches, then Chloe gets out a knife and stabs her, twice. This is the opening to Stab 7, which Jenny and Marnie (Aimee Teegarden and Britt Robertson) are watching. After Jenny pranks Marnie, she is killed. Jenny is threatened over the phone by a voice, and then chased through the house by Ghostface himself, leading to her demise in the garage.Ten years since the events known as The Woodsboro Massacre, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to her hometown as one of the stops on her book-signing tour. However, things do not go well when Dewey Riley (David Arquette, who is now the town's Sheriff) interrupts the signing, claiming that the murder of Jenny and Marnie are linked to a cellular phone somewhere in the bookstore's vicinity. Everyone is surprised when the phone is found in the trunk of Sidney's rental car, along with bloody handprints.While Dewey intends to find out what is going on, the incident quickly spreads across the town like wildfire. Gale Weathers-Riley (Courteney Cox, who is Dewey's wife), gets her old spark back and in an effort to be in the spotlight again, intends to investigate what happened.Dewey assigns a police detail to patrol the place where Sidney will be staying, which happens to be the residence of her aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell), and cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). It is here that Sidney has a deja vu moment, in going to her cousin's room, only to see her cousin's ex-boyfriend Trevor (Nico Tortorella) sneaking out a nearby window after Jill has asked him to leave.Later on that evening, Jill and her friend Kirby (Hayden Panettiere) are watching a movie, when Kirby gets a call from someone sounding like 'Ghostface.' The voice claims he's hiding in the closet, which Kirby checks, but finds no one. The voice then claims that he isn't standing in Jill's closet. In the house next door, their friend Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) is shocked when the killer bursts from HER closet and gruesomely kills her. Sidney hears what's going on, and breaks into Olivia's place, attempting to stop the killer. However, he escapes just as the police arrive.Sidney is taken to the local hospital to be checked over, but is upset when her book-signing's publicist Rebecca (Alison Brie) claims that these new killings can help the sales of Sidney's self-help book. Sidney fires Rebecca on the spot, who heads to the facility's parking garage, only to be menaced and then killed, before her body is thrown off the top of the garage onto the roof of a nearby news van.Gale is still trying to get to the bottom of the mystery, and convinces Sidney to come with her to the local 'Cinema Club' at the high school, run by Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin) and Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen). The two claim that if the killer is attempting to kill people in a 'remake' fashion. While some things may be similar, the killer's style is not going to be exactly like the first time, and that to make the situation even more intense, they may even be recording the murders to post them on the internet.When someone brings up that the end of the murder-spree the first time was at a house party, Charlie and Robbie immediately assume that the killer may strike at their upcoming 'Stab-a-Thon,' where they'll run all the movies in the 'Stab' series (based on the original murders). Some question why hold the 'Stab-a-Thon' in the first place, but the guys assume that they aren't the only party in town, as teenagers on a Friday night have plenty of other party options.Gale manages to find the party, and disguising herself, sets up cameras to view what's going on in the party. However, as she watches from her car, the cameras start to get covered up. Gale places a call to Dewey, before sneaking back into the party. While attempting to fix the camera in the rafters, she comes across a remote webcam, before being stabbed by the killer. Dewey shows up just as Gale collapses to the ground floor, but the killer has once again eluded capture. She survives and it taken to the local hospital.Meanwhile, two police officiers, Ross and Perkins, (Adam Brody and Anthony Anderson) who are on watch outside Kate's house, are both killed by Ghostface. Sidney finds out the Jill snuck out and went to Kirby's. When Kate gets back from shopping Sidney tells her that Jill went to Kirby's. Kate attempts to call her, she does not answer. As the two attempt to go over and get her, the killer appears and kills Kate. Sidney manages to escape, and rushes over to Kirby's place. The killer manages to get to Kirby's house before she arrives.Jill, Kirby, Charlie, and Robbie are relaxing at Kirby's place when Trevor shows up. Jill claims he wasn't invited, but Trevor claims he got a message from Jill's phone. Jill explains this to be impossible, as her phone has been missing recently. Kirby suggests that Jill should go to her room to look for it, and Trevor follows her.Robbie indulges in some alcohol, and ends up going outside, where he is killed. Back inside, Kirby reveals to Charlie her penchant for horror movies, and that she finds him attractive. However, the moment is interrupted when Trevor reappears. Charlie and Trevor leave the living room, leaving Kirby alone. Jill comes from downstairs, and Sidney comes into the house, telling Jill and Kirby of Kate's death. Ghostface appears, and chases them through the house, where Jill hides under a bed and Kirby hides in the basement.When Sidney comes down to the basement to find Kirby, they both find Charlie on the porch, covered in blood. Ghostface appears and ties him to a chair. Kirby's phone rings, and the killer claims he wants to play a game with her, testing her horror movie knowledge. With the killer busy, Sidney runs up the stairs to try to find Jill, to find her missing. When the voice on the phone stops, Kirby rushes out, and attempts to untie Charlie...only to have him stab her, upset that it took til' now for her to find him attractive, which leaves her for dead.Sidney is then attacked by Charlie with the knife, but manages to escape and she starts running to the front door and is then stabbed by Ghostface, confirming that there is a second killer. Ghostface removes his mask...and it is revealed that Jill is also in on it! Jill then lets loose a torrid of hatred at Sidney, claiming that her cousin's fame was always rubbed in her face, and how sick she was of it. Jill now claims that soon, Sidney will die, and in the wake of the killer's spree, she'll become famous instead. Charlie also assumes he's going to be part of the plan, but is shocked when Jill kills him as well. She then kills Trevor with a gun, and supposedly kills Sidney.Jill then sets up the situation as if her ex-boyfriend Trevor was the true killer, planting the knife, mutilating herself, leaving bits of her hair in his hand, and smashing and breaking things around the room. Dewey and the other officers eventually reach Kirby's place, and immediately, when it seems that Jill is still alive, the press descend and peg her as a 'survivor.'In the hospital, Dewey visits with Jill, who claims that maybe one day she can write a book with Gale, since they have the same injuries. Dewey also explains to Jill that Sidney will recover,revealing that she is still alive, and everything will be fine.However, once he leaves, Jill gets out of her bed, and rushes to Sidney's room, intending to kill her cousin once and for all. Dewey manages to show up (having realized that Jill slipped up mentioning similar injuries to Gale...something she shouldn't have been able to know!), but is knocked out by Jill's use of a bedpan. Gale and Deputy Officer Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton) are right behind him, but Jill manages to take Dewey's gun, and corner them behind a bed. Jill demands Judy's gun, and gets it, before shooting the her. Jill then threatens Gale, only to have Gale buy time before Sidney manages to charge up a defibrillator and use the paddles to 'shock' her cousin into submission. Everything seems to be OK, until Jill rises for 'one last scare,' and Sidney kills her cousin with a bullet to the chest.

title: Enemy Mine
synopsis: Enemy Mine opens to a panorama of outer space along with an opening monologue by Willis Davidge (Dennis Quaid). In this monologue he says that all of Earth's nations had achieved peace by the end of the 21st century, and had begun working together to explore and colonize outer space. Unfortunately, Earth wasn't alone out there. Earth colonists encountered a race of alien nonhumanoids known as the Dracs, were laying claim to some of the richest star systems in the galaxy. Dispute over who was where, first, and who had 'legal right' to where, led to battle and finally war between Earth and the drac people.The scene shifts to an Earth space station out in space, far from the Solar System. Four Drac fighter ships approach to begin a raid. Earth's fighter pilots scramble to defend the station; among them are Davidge and his co-pilot, Joey Wooster (Lance Kerwin). The dogfight appears to be going well for the Earth defenders until six Drac fighter ships arrive to join the battle. One of the Drac fighters destroys an Earth fighter, Echo Six, killing its two pilots. Infuriated, Davidge recklessly pursues this Drac ship away from the rest of the battle, but this Drac pilot proves to be an ace flier, deftly dodging several laser volleys. Wooster tries to warn Davidge that their ship's engines are overheating and they are closing over the planet Fyrine IV, which is unexplored territory. But David is obsessed with destroying the Drac ship and its pilot. Finally he scores a hit to the Drac ship's wing, damaging it but not destroying it. Completely single-minded now, Davidge continues pursuing the Drac ship into the upper atmosphere of Fyrine IV. He sees the Drac pilot eject from its ship, and then loses sight of both pilot and ship in the thick fog of the upper atmosphere. Finally the fog cloud breaks to show the abandoned Drac fighter ship directly in front of Davidge's ship. With no time to move, he collides with the Drac ship, damaging his own ship to where he must make a crash landing of his own on Fyrine IV's surface. Davidge is able to pull Wooster free from the wreck, but his ship explodes, leaving him unable to salvage any of its supplies... and Wooster is too gravely injured to save.Davidge builds a barrow of stones over Wooster's body and sets Wooster's broken helmet on it as a grave marker. He's spotted where the Drac ship's wreckage went down and is sure the escape pod with the Drac pilot is near it. As he sets off to kill the Drac, Davidge gives a voiceover where he says he's never seen one of their race before, knowing very little about their physiology-- only that they are reptilian and scaly, and that they are hermaphroditic-- they have both male and female body parts.A strange turtle-like creature emerges from some rocks as Davidge passes them, and makes its way across the ground. It falls into a shallow sinkhole of loose sand; still deep enough that it cannot make its way out. A long tendril snakes out of the bottom of the sinkhole, feeling the air for vibrations and smells. It draws back and latches onto the creature's shell, pulling it down below the sand. Some horrible noises are heard as the sand at the bottom of the sinkhole continues to churn. Suddenly the turtle-creature's shell is spat out of the sinkhole where it joins many other similar shells around the sinkhole's edges, and a monstrous belching sound is heard.Davidge makes his way to a lake where he finds the Drac pilot (Louis Gossett Jr.) swimming in the lake. It emerges from the water to squat by a campfire. Davidge moves closer to make the kill, but as he aims his pistol, a small rock outcropping under his boot gives way. He barely holds onto the rocks, but his gun falls from his hand to drop into the lake below, and the noise alerts the Drac pilot. Although reptilian and clearly non-human, the Drac still appears to have the same basic body structure, with two arms and two legs, standing erect, and its hands have opposable thumbs, although only two other fingers for a total of three on each hand.Davidge remains stone still and waits until nightfall. The Drac puts its rifle on the bulkhead of its wrecked spacecraft and dives into the lake to swim again. Pulling a utility knife, Davidge hurries to the ship's wreckage. Finding a container of what is apparently a combustible fuel, he pours it onto the lake's surface and ignites it with a flare. Laughing maniacally at the thought that the Drac must be burning, he reaches for its rifle. Suddenly his own body is gripped in convulsions; the Drac had placed the weapon in direct contact with the ship's exposed circuitry as a precaution. Kicking Davidge away from the ship and the weapon, the Drac stands over him and gives a gloating greeting.The Drac ties Davidge's hands and feet together and seats him near the ship while it eats. Seeing that the Drac has chosen not to kill him for now, but still full of hate and anger toward it, Davidge demands that the Drac give him something to eat. It mockingly copies a lip-smacking motion that Davidge makes in an attempt to communicate. Even though they speak different languages, when Davidge yells the insult 'toadface' at the Drac, it suddenly stands up and walks over to Davidge, squatting over him. It asks a question in its native tongue, jabbing Davidge with a finger. When the Drac speaks the phrase, 'kos va son Jeriba Shigan-- Shiiigaaaann!,' Davidge reaizes that the Drac has just told him its name: Jeriba Shigan. He understands the Drac wants to know his name in return and gives the Drac his name as Willis Davidge. He again demands some food, and the Drac skewers a disgusting-looking slug like creature on a stick. As horrible as the slug looks and, Davidge imagines, must taste, he is so ravenous with hunger that he suddenly leans forward, bites off a piece of the slug, and forces himself to chew and swallow, much to the Drac's disgust.Later still, the Drac is sleeping while Davidge tries to in his uncomfortable position. A meteorite strikes the ground near him, and suddenly the sky is alight with a meteor shower. Davidge's frightened shouts awaken the Drac, who utters the word 'zeerki' in its native tongue. It starts to run for the cave, pauses, and cuts Davidge's feet free so he can follow it into a nearby cave for shelter. The Drac falls asleep again, and Davidge manages to free his hands on some of the rocks in the cave. He takes the knife and appears ready to kill the Drac, but as he looks on its face while it sleeps, he cannot bring himself to do the deed. He goes to the Drac's ship and finds several containers of emergency food supplies. The food pellets look, smell, and taste absolutely horrendous to Davidge's human sense of taste, but he forces one of the pellets down. Suddenly he is knocked down from behind and the Drac makes a menacing noise, holding its rifle on Davidge. Using gestures and body language in an attempt to make his human language intelligible, Davidge manages to convey that the two of them need to gather up whatever supplies they can from the wreckage and find a place to build a suitable shelter, or else they will most likely die in the next meteor shower.The Drac makes Davidge carry most of the salvagable supplies so it can keep its rifle at the ready. They find a clearing where Davidge builds a hut as best he can. During this time, both he and the Drac manage to learn a little of each other's languages: the Drac tells him the shelter isn't solid. Davidge lightly kicks the inside doorframe and laughs-- but it's the Drac that has the last laugh when the shelter suddenly collapses.The two are at a campfire where the Drac is learning more of the human tongue. Davidge has begun calling the Drac 'Jerry,' a contraction of Jeriba, even though Drac names are spoken surname-first and Jerry's given first name is Shigan. During the conversation, Davidge mentions an Earth saying that Jerry seems somewhat familiar with, and Jerry asks if he learned it from the great drac teacher, Shismar. Davidge sarcastically says he learned it from Mickey Mouse, but Jerry takes him seriously, deciding that Mickey Mouse must be a great human teacher.Davidge is carrying more supplies from the wreckage to the campfire when he happens to spot one of the turtle-like creatures. He grabs at it, but it scuttles away very quickly; although this creature has a turtle-like shell, the rest of its body is decidedly different and it moves quite rapidly when it chooses.At the camp, Davidge cooks another of the slug like creatures while Jerry appears to be praying and meditating; a small tome attached to a chain which Jerry often wears around his neck, open before him. The book is called the Talman, and it is the drac people's sacred book, much like the human bible. Davidge has constructed a bow and arrows with which he hopes to procure better food sources, but Jerry feels that they will be rescued soon. An argument soon arises over their respective people's sacred teachers and which race started the war, ending when Davidge insults Shismar in a grievous way. Jerry retaliates by calling Mickey Mouse a 'great big stupid dope,' and it is all Davidge can do to stop himself from busting out laughing.Davidge is hunting the next day and looses an arrow right into the head of one of the turtle like creatures. Though badly wounded, it is still able to move. Davidge chases it-- and falls into the pit of loose sand. He watches in horror as the long pink tendril emerges and feels the air for scents and air vibrations. It looms very close, unfamiliar with Davidge's scent. But finally it rears back and coils around his leg. Davidge screams in horror, gripping a broken piece of a tree that sticks over the edge of the pit. Jerry hears his screams and comes running. The tendril constricts Davidge's leg, and the rough edges of the tip of it lacerates his flesh. His grip breaks and he's about to be dragged into the bottom of the pit when Jerry catches his hand and fires his rifle, severing the tendril. There is a great churning from the sand at the bottom of the pit and great roaring noises before the terrible head of the creature to whom the tendril (its tongue) belonged emerges, spreading a gaping maw full of sharp teeth. Jerry fires again, sending several blasts into the creature's head and destroying it.Back at camp, Jerry cauterizes and wraps up Davidge's wound. Davidge asks why Jerry saved his life, and Jerry says he needed to look at another face, even if it was Davidge's. Jerry naturally finds humans as ugly (in comparison to dracs) as Davidge must consider dracs to be in comparison to humans. But, the terrible creature in the sand pit was worse, to both of them.Davidge's hand happens to fall on one of the discarded shells. He realizes that the sand-pit creature couldn't bite through them, and the shells might even be able to repel meteors, and their light weight makes them perfect for a shelter. He sets about collecting discarded shells from around the pit and from other turtle=like creatures he's killed for food, and builds a secure shelter.Jerry is reading his Talman again. Davidge decides, to pass the time, if he could learn the Drac language from Jerry so he can learn some of Shismar's philosophies. Jerry feels that the insult Davidge rendered to Shismar makes him beneath such an understaking. Davidge promptly calls Jerry out on being a hypocrite, as it had promptly insulted Mickey Mouse in return. But Jerry quickly apologizes for this, saying it was wrong and didn't mean it. Davidge offers the same apology in return, and Jerry hangs the Talman on the chain around Davidge's neck-- on becoming a tutor, the book, according to his people, must be given to the student.Davidge gives a voiceover among a short montage of scenes showing how time passes, and he and Jerry continue to eke out an existence on the hostile world. They eat, they sleep, they study the Talman, and at night Davidge sometimes dreams of a rescue-- he's awakened one night thinking he's heard the sound of a ship's engines and barely catches a glimpse of ship lights. But on looking outside the shelter, he cannot find anything.Davidge is reading a passage of the Talman aloud as Jerry listens. Jerry is not at all surprised when Davidge says the passage is something he's read in the human version of the book (the Bible), saying simply, 'truth is truth.' It says, however, that Shismar's words take on new meaning when sung. Jerry begins to sing another passage, when suddenly another meteor shower strikes, and the two of them must hurry to their shelter.Jerry moves noticeably slower and even seems to stumble once or twice as they hurry to the shelter. Worry over how Jerry could have been hurt leads Davidge to carelessly make a remark referring to the human vs. drac war. Jerry quickly becomes defensive, and a heated argument erupts that escalates into a physical altercation. Afterward, they both lay exhausted on the ground inside the hut, and Davidge realizes that he and Jerry are starting to go crazy from the isolation and struggle to survive.Davidge finally decides to set out and explore more of the planet in hopes of locating the source of the sounds and lights he still believes he's heard and seen. Jerry, believing they are alone on the planet, declines to go along. Davidge can tell something is amiss with Jerry, but the drac doesn't discuss it. Davidge promises to return when he's satisfied his need to investigate. If he cannot return, he and Jerry will probably both die.Davidge heads out toward the glow of a lake of molten lava. He's originally elated and whoops in pure delight at the site of a temporary core sampling camp and two empty bottles of Pepsi-cola. He finds a large pile of junk metal, proof of a mining operation on the planet. But Davidge's joy is short lived as he finds a dire and terrible discovery among this junk heap: the skull of a drac, with a human bullet hole in the front... proving the drac to whom the skull belonged, was killed by a gunshot to its brain.Davidge gives a voiceover amid scenes where he grimly confirms what he now knows: the planet is being used by scavengers, outlaw human miners and pirates living at the darkest underbelly of human society. They strip and rape entire planets bare of their resources looking for precious ores and metals. Earth's military tolerates them-- barely-- because they kidnap dracs for slave labor for their mining operations. It was a scavenger ship he had heard and seen. These scavengers would kill Davidge as soon as look at him, both for his being part of Earth's defense militia as well as engaging in any kind of cooperation with a drac.Davidge returns to Jerry at the shelter. Winter has fallen on Fyrine IV. Jerry is pleased to see Davidge, and finally reveals what has been amiss with it, and the true reason it couldn't go with Davidge. Jerry is pregnant, preparing to give birth to a baby drac. Jerry reminds Davidge that unlike humans, the drac people are hermaphroditic, and they reproduce automatically 'when it is time--' procreation among the dracs is not something that only happens through deliberate choice, as it is with humans.Jerry asks Davidge if he found what he was looking for. Davidge had been wrestling throughout the trip back on what to tell Jerry. Finally deciding he can't share his findings about the scavengers and the danger they represent, Davidge finally tells Jerry that he found nothing-- as Jerry believed, the two of them are alone on Fyrine IV.More time passes, and Jerry is sewing a garment for its child. When asked by Davidge if it's picked a name out for the drac baby, Jerry says the baby's name will be Zammis.Davidge and Jerry are asleep in their shelter. Suddenly the ground beside them begins to shift, and a small sinkhole begins to appear-- another of the sand-pit creatures has been moving underground and found them. The creature's long tongue slithers out from the sand and tastes the air. The tongue wraps around Jerry's neck, choking him so he cannot yell, and begins to drag it toward the creature's gaping jaws. Jerry thrashes and kicks about in desperation. Slowly Davidge begins to awaken and suddenly snaps to full alertness. Without hesitating or thinking, he turns to the smoldering remains of the campfire, scoops up a large double handful of the white-hot coals in his bare hands and tosses them down the sand-pit creature's throat. The creature lets go of Jerry and thrashes about in agony, wrecking the shelter. Hurrying away from the terrible monster before it can recover, Davidge and Jerry hurry to find a new, more natural shelter from both the creature and the bitter cold and driving snow and wind.In an effort to keep both of them focused, Davidge asks Jerry to tell him about the name it chose for its baby. Jerry explains that unlike humans, each Drac family cycles through five names continuously; the names themselves mean nothing, but it is the deeds each drac achieves throughout its lifetime that matter and must be remembered. Jerry's clan, the Jeriba family, cycles through the names Ty, Islane, Gothig, Shigan, and Zammis. As Jerry's given name is Shigan, its baby is to be called Zammis, and then the cycle would begin again with another Jeriba Ty.Jerry and Davidge manage to find a natural rock cave leading deep into the ground that will provide them warmth and shelter. As they collapse on the ground to sleep again, Jerry says that a drac child does not completely join its family or the society of drac people until it is brought by its parent before the holy council of dracs on their home planet of Dracon, and the family lineage recited. Jerry will need to do this for Zammis, or the great lineage of Jeriba will end. Jerry asks Davidge to tell it about his own family and ancestors and their deeds. Davidge, as a human, remembers only as far back as two of his grandparents, and only a little about what they did for a living. When it is Jerry's turn to teach its lineage to Davidge, it explains how the Jeriba line is 170 generations long since its founding by Jeriba Ty, going back to the founding of the very drac homeworld. The lineage song tells of what accomplishments each family member has made and achieved in its lifetime, ending with the latest member bringing its child before the holy council. Understanding the great honor involved, Davidge learns the Jeriba lineage song and commits its every verse to memory.More time passes, and suddenly Jerry realizes it is time to deliver Zammis... but it can tell that something is dreadfully wrong, although it doesn't know what. Still, it realizes that these birthing complications are very serious. Davidge quickly goes into a panic at the thought of losing Jerry, who by now has become his dearest-- and on Fyrine, his only-- friend. Davidge's fears only intensify as Jerry suddenly calms down and begs Davidge to take its place as a parent for Zammis, and that one day, Davidge must fulfill the role that Jerry itself was destined for: to bring Zammis before the holy council on the drac homeworld and recite its lineage, that the Jeriba clan will not be ended. Jerry is only satisfied when Davidge vows to do this. Jerry tells Davidge that he must pull open the birthing sac along Jerry's abdomen to deliver Zammis. Davidge can only watch helplessly as Jerry slowly passes on and dies. Stricken in horror, Davidge sits numbly, but then notices the birthing sac moving. He pulls it open and extracts the newborn drac baby, Zammis, looking it over in wonder.A despondent Davidge buries Jerry in a grave of rocks, realizing that with all Jerry taught him about the task he's undertaken, it taught Davidge nothing about properly taking care of a baby drac. Davidge finds himself struggling but manages to successfully feed baby Zammis, gently holding the baby close against him within the bundle of heavy skin garments that keep him warm.Zammis grows faster than a human child, quickly growing to about the size of a human youth just transitioning into adolescence, and able to think, reason, and communicate. Davidge teaches young Zammis (now played by Bumper Robinson) how to play football, using puffballs-- an edible fungus native to the planet-- as the ball.One day Zammis begins to question why it is different from Davidge. It knows what it looks like by having seen its reflection in a pool of water within their cave, and that it looks different from Davidge. Zammis understands that it is of a different race than Davidge (who has taught Zammis to call him, 'Uncle'), and that Davidge isn't its parent... but as there are no other dracs available to help Zammis appreciate its race and people, it desperately wishes it were human like Davidge.The day eventually comes when Zammis is able to explore. It learns about the scavenger mine and, despite Davidge's desperate attempts to teach the child never to go near it, Zammis finally one day goes there in hopes of seeing other Dracs. Bewildered and horrified at the site of human scavengers beating drac slaves, Zammis turns away only to find two of the scavengers standing right before him-- Stubbs (Brion James), one of the scavenger leaders, and his young brother, Johnny. The two of them grab Zammis, when suddenly an arrow pierces through the back of Johnny's neck and out through his throat, killing him. Davidge stands there, bow at the ready. Unfortunately, after breaking free, Zammis runs between Davidge and Stubbs, distracting Davidge and throwing off his aim. Stubbs whips out his pistol and fires a shot, severely wounding Davidge. Zammis screams in horror as he watches his 'uncle' tumble down the hill, before Stubbs grabs him and drags him off to the mine as a new slave.Two searchlights sweep the vicinity and converge on Davidge.Back on the Earth space station, deceased military are being given 'burials' in space-- placed into capsules and jettisoned to float among the stars. They find a John Doe with a curious necklace with a small book on it... it's Davidge. Figuring that this John Doe won't need the booklet anymore, one worker tries to remove the necklace-- and Davidge's hand suddenly seizes the worker by the throat. He's still alive.Davidge is placed in a medical capsule and rushed to sickbay where his peers and superiors confirm his identity. They're completely amazed to see that he is still alive after having disappeared three years ago over Fyrine IV... and that he speaks the drac language fluently; he'd been speaking it in a state of delirium while being brought to sickbay.No sooner is Davidge healed and well again when he is determined to return to Fyrine IV to rescue Zammis. The fighter squadron leader, Arnold (Richard Marcus) cannot stop him. When Station ops refuses to open the docking bay doors for him, Davidge uses his ship's cannons to blast them open and flies down to Fyrine.Davidge infiltrates the scavenger camp, sneaking his way to where a group of dracs are working. He tries to speak to the dracs, asking them about Zammis, even showing them his Talmon. The dracs only stare until a scavenger overseer arrives and starts beating the dracs to make them return to work. Davidge kills the overseer, and the eldest of the drac slaves finally answers Davidge, realizing who he is. He alone among the dracs in the mine knows how to speak English. He tells Davidge that Zammis is somewhere in the ship proper.Davidge kills another scavenger overseer and takes his clothing. He finds his way to where Zammis is locked in a cramped cage. Seeing Zammis is alive, albeit barely, he pries open the cage door. At that moment Stubbs arrives with two scavenger miners. They've found the severed ear of the overseer Davidge killed and dropped into the gears of an ore processor. Stubbs gets a close look at Davidge's face and recognizes him. He grabs Zammis and orders the worker to bring Davidge along.Davidge fights back and takes out the two miners. He grabs a pistol and kills a number of other scavengers. The drac slaves are alerted to the noise, begin to understand what is going on, and prepare an uprising.Arnold lands on Fyrine with pilot Morse (Carolyn McCormick) and her ship's co-pilot. They land beside Davidge's ship and make their way to the camp.Stubbs yells out to Davidge, saying he's going to drop Zammis into a mining cart that's on a conveyor system which will drop Zammis into molten lava. Davidge fights Stubbs, but is constantly forced to divert his attention to rescuing Zammis, giving Stubbs an advantage. Stubbs finally knocks Davidge out and pushes both him and Zammis into the mining cart. As he yells and gloats, he is suddenly killed by a shotgun blast by the elder drac. Arnold shuts down the conveyor system and pulls Davidge and Zammis out of the cart. Everyone watches grimly as Davidge tearfully frets over Zammis, until Zammis slowly reaches for Davidge's hand and weakly says, Zammis get four, five? Davidge begins to laugh in relief at seeing that Zammis is alive and will recover.A closing narration tells that Davidge brought Zammis and all of the dracs home to the drac home world of Dracon, and fulfilled his promise, presenting Zammis to the drac holy council and reciting the Jeriba lineage so that Zammis could officially join the drac people... and that when Zammis eventually reached adulthood and presented its own child, Jeriba Ty, before the council, the name Willis Davidge was added to the line of Jeriba.

title: Unfriended
synopsis: The Universal Studios logo plays but starts breaking up, an homage to the broken Skype video that will take place in the film.The movie starts with someone's video desktop. (Note: the entire movie takes place from the point-of-view of a laptop computer screen). They are on LiveLeak website being told that the video they are about to watch is disturbing and they must agree to be 18 or older to view it. They accept. The description top says this is a response to a YouTube video anonymously posted (with a link). The blurry video is played, showing a girl on a schools baseball field with a gun pointed at her face. People scream out at her to drop the gun but then she shoots herself. Everyone screams. The video is stopped as people run to her. The YouTube link is clicked and begins to play.We see Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) at a party, drunk, lying on a table with a guy on top of her. The video is interrupted as an incoming Skype call comes in its a shirtless guy lying on his bed named Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm). He asks the girl whose POV we are seeing the film from to show off her body. She shows off her knees. He tells her to go higher. He picks up a large knife and demands that she take off her top. She tilts the camera up and unbuttons her shirt she is not wearing a bra but does not pull the shirt open and then tilts the camera down to show off her panties. All the while she tells him to keep threatening her with the knife, (i.e., Take off those panties or I'll do it for you). We see her face; she is Blaire (Shelley Hennig), the pretty heroine of the story (and from the POV of her laptop screen takes place). She tells Mitch that she is ready to have sex for the first time with him on the night of formal. This conversation is interrupted when three other people pop up on the Skype call. Their videos freeze her in her underwear and him, jumping up in his boxer shorts. His best friend, Adam (Will Peltz), points out that Mitch has a boner. Jess (Renee Olstead), Blaire's friend, is there, too, along with their wisecracking pal, Ken (Jacob Wysocki).They notice that there is a mysterious person on the Skype with them, who is dubbed billie227. Ken jokes that he probably learned about their chat on the Boners & Farts website. He holds up his blender and says he's going to make his salsa and then there will be farts. They keep asking who invited the stranger but nobody knows who it is. They all disconnect to try to get rid of him. Blaire messages Mitch and asks who the guy is. He says he doesn't know. She continues talking, but he disappears from the conversation.They all reconnect in the Skype but the mysterious unseen person Billie227 is still there.They try to disconnect him but there is no option on his video to do so. Laura continues messaging Mitch privately on Skype, asking where he went. He says he was distracted by a weird message from Laura Barns. Just then, she gets a Facebook notification saying she got a new message from Laura Barns, too. Laura asks her, Hey, Blair, who posted the video? Blair asks, Who is this? It says, Laura is typing but there is no reply. She continues asking questions and types: Why would you do something so messed up? but doesn't send. On the Skype messenger, Mitch tells her that maybe the dead is trying to contact with them and sends her a link to a website forum where people are posting pictures and telling stories about how someone they knew was contacted by the deceased and then ends up killing themselves. It says people can be possessed and that they should not respond to any contact from the dead. Blaire begins freaking out with Mitch, asking who this person is and what she should do. He tells her she should unfriend her. She goes on the Facebook profile but both Unfriend and Report/Block are unclickable. She tells Mitch this, freaking out, asking him for help. He calmly replies, Try refreshing the page. She does and it actually works she unfriends her. She then gets a message from Billie227 saying Nice try. Laura is still listed as her friend.Mitch and Blaire go back in the Skype room, nervous. The others say they want to bring Val into the conversation but they all groan, saying they can't stand her. Val (Courtney Halverson) connects with them and Ken loudly calls her a slut and starts teasing her. They begin talking about the concert tickets Val is getting them. Blaire continues messaging with Mitch, telling him she couldn't unfriend her. He suggests that it's her brother. She says her brother wouldn't do that. He tells Blaire to turn her account into a Memorial page. She does a Google search on how to memorialize a Facebook account.Blaire stumbles upon a RIP Laura Barns Facebook community page with thousands of likes, realizing that Laura is now more popular and loved than ever. Blaire fills out the form typing in Laura Burns name, the date of her death, and finding an article on Google about her suicide as proof she is deceased. She lists herself as a friend, opts for it to be made into a Memorial Site, and then clicks Send. Immediately, all of her answers change to: WEGOTHER WEGOTHER WEGOTHER WEGOTHER written over and over which causes the form not to end. Now she realizes she isn't dealing with just a normal person. Laura Barns messages her and asks: What are you watching? Blaire clicks over to the paused Laura Barns YouTube video she was watching at the beginning of the film paused at Laura passed out (with half of the video un-played). She quickly clears her History.(Note: one of the Tabs above is a link to MTV's Teen Wolf which the actress who plays Blaire is on).Blaire and Mitch message each other privately. He tells her he can't stand Val and that she is a floozy. When they go back in the chat, Billie calls Val a floozy, infuriating Val who demands to know who Billie227 is. Blaire is relieved and tells Mitch he scared her to death with his pranks but he promises her that he isn't behind Billie. Blaire then gets a notification on her Facebook that Jess has posted a photo album with Val tagged in it. She scrolls through to see tons of pics of Val drunk at someones house, smoking a bong. Everyone looks at the pics the same time and laughs at Val. She is upset, saying her mom is one of her Facebook friends, and yells at Jess. Jess says she thought the pics were funny but she didn't post them. Val begins to argue with Jess and Ken says he will pick them up and they can fight outside a Wendy's. Jess continues that she didn't post the pics but she will delete them. She then tells everyone, every time she clicks delete, she refreshes the page and it's back again. Finally, it works. But then a notification comes that Adam has posted the same pics. Val yells at him, asking if he copied and pasted, but he swears he didn't post. Blaire tells them how Laura Barns contacted her. They point out it's the one year anniversary of her suicide. Ken says that Laura was a slut and she deserved what happened to her. The mysterious user now begins typing to them, telling them it's Laura. They all put their hands up to show that they are not the ones who are typing. Billie (the user name of the unknown Skype account) tells them if they hang up, they're going to die. She then tells them Lights out and the lights simultaneously go off in their rooms. Now, they know it's not a joke. They start screaming at Billie and Adam grabs his father's gun and threatens to come over there and kill him. Billie continues taunting them and Val tells her she's going to come over there and mess her up. Billie replies: You wouldn't like it where I am. Val gets a message (via email) and freaks out, saying that she has now been threatened. She calls the police and gives her address saying she is being threatened by someone online. The police say they'll be there shortly. Val signs off.Billie then plays the Laura Barns YouTube video on everyone's computer. They try to close it but the video pops up over and over and it will not click off. We now see the end of the video where Laura is drunk on the ground, lying in her own feces. She shows a meme of her labeled LEAKY LAURA and individual YouTube comments from anonymous users which Billie points out is them. Blaire messages Laura Barns on Facebook saying that she's sorry. She explains that everyone was posting comments so they all did it too. She adds, But they're good people. Blaire looks at the profile of Billie's account and it is listed as Laura Barns. She now remembers that she used to chat with her on there and never deleted her from her user list. Billie threatens all of them and begins to count down, saying she will start to kill someone at the end of 60 seconds. Ken tells everyone to mute their computers and call each other on the phone. Jess freaks out because she has no phone. They all start talking to each other, oblivious that Billie is telling them that she can still hear them. They devise a plan to install a Trojan virus remover that should get rid of the user if he is a troll. Everyone is told to download the game Ken sends. Blaire downloads the Trojan Remover software along with everyone else but her Trash won't empty because an episode of SNL is still in her QuickTime Player. Right as Billie is finishing her countdown, Blaire closes down QuickTime, runs the program, and empties the trash. They all disconnect again and when they come back, the user is gone. They're all relieved and they laugh about the paranoia. They tease Adam for grabbing his dad's gun and he points out that his dad is out getting drunk with Mitch's dad (a way to explain that all their parents aren't home). Then Blaire gets an email from someone named Billie; it is a link to the picture on Instagram that Val had been sent. Blaire begins freaking out. Her friends tell her to send the email to Ken because he can track down the user via their IP address. But there is no Forwarding button. Adam complains to the girls with computers and they try to tell her how to Forward but she says there is no option. She sends a screen shot to Ken instead and he manually types in the Instagram link. They look at the Instagram picture and it is a screen shot of Laura emailing Val a year earlier, where Val ignores Laura's attempt at friendship and instead writes: KILL URSELF LAURA! The Instagram picture is already filled with comments from other students, telling Val she is a horrible person and that she is the one who killed Laura.(Everyone now loves Laura after the cyber-bullying led her to kill herself.)Val sends a request to chat and the group accepts. Val is standing, mindlessly, in her laundry room, next to a bottle of bleach, but the video appears frozen as she is not moving. They notice that the mirror behind her is messed up as if there's been some sort of struggle. Val continues standing still, frozen, and unresponsive but we hear her dog barking. Blaire calls her phone. Val's phone begins to wiggle on the screen proving that the screen is not frozen Val's just not moving.BAM. Val's computer gets knocked down to the ground. We hear police officers entering the house. They start yelling out codes. Blaire goes on Google and looks up the police codes. The first one is for a time check. The second one she mishears and thinks its a call for medical help. She figures Val is just having a seizure and remembers that she mentioned she had a medical condition that causes seizures before the others don't know if this is correct. Blaire tries to find previous conversation on Facebook where she talked to Val about her seizures. But then Ken points out that the code was repeated as 10-56. Blaire looks it up and the code means suicide. They all freak out and Blaire tries to convince herself that Val just had a seizure.Billie is back and tells them she knows all their secrets and is going to reveal them all. If they hang up, she will kill them. She then sends them all a file called NOTBOYFRIEND.JPG to download. Everyone is told not to click it but Blaire downloads the file and looks at it anyway. It's a picture of her lying romantically with Adam (not Mitch, her boyfriend). A second photo appears and she downloads it. It completes much faster and is another pic of Blaire and Adam together. In the chat, the mysterious user pops up again but now, instead of an icon, it's a video. They all shout We can see you. But they aren't quite sure what they're looking at. It looks like it's from inside a crate. Ken says he's not going to just sit there and they see movement through the crate. The others tell him to go back to the computer and then stand up. Then, they realize the video is filming from a crate inside Ken's house. In both the crate video (from Billie's account) and Ken's video, we see him moving towards the crate and staring at something inside. Then his video becomes static and we start seeing, in broken flashes, him putting his hand and then, his face in a blender. It's not very clear what's happening because it's only shown in flashes, but blood is shown and he is committing suicide throughout the scene.Now, it's just Blaire, Adam, Mitch, and Jess. Billie says they're going to play a game called 'Never Have I Ever'. Jess notes it's the drinking game but Blaire has never even heard of the game, so they explain that she holds up five fingers and if she has done something, she puts one down. Billie tells them, in this game, if the loser doesn't drink, they will die. Billie starts listing statements: NEVER HAVE I EVER SPREAD A RUMOR ABOUT BLAIRE HAVING AN EATING DISORDER. Billie counts down from 10 until Jess finally admits it was her who started it, defending herself by saying it's kind of true since Blaire always says things like I'm not hungry. Blaire is furious with her. Billie says: NEVER HAVE I EVER TURNED A FRIEND INTO THE COPS FOR POT. And Billie begins to countdown. Mitch admits it was him who told the cops about Adam because they both would have been in trouble otherwise. Adam is furious with Mitch and starts going berserk. Blaire messages Mitch privately to be careful with Adam because he has gone haywire before. Mitch points out only when he's drunk and Blaire tells him Adam is drunk now. Billie suggests: NEVER HAVE I EVER OFFERED JESS'S LIFE FOR MY OWN and counts down from 20. Finally, Adam admits it was him (apparently as an exchange between him and Billie/Laura Barns). Everyone begins fighting with each other. Blaire tells them that Billie is trying to make them all turn on each other and not to give in. Mitch then starts shouting out things: NEVER HAVE I EVER DRUGGED ASHLEY. NEVER HAVE I EVER FORCED ASHLEY TO HAVE AN ABORTION. To upset Mitch, Adam suggests one: NEVER HAVE I EVER HAD SEX. Billie counts down, repeating 5 over and over, until Blaire finally admits she has had sex (in the beginning of the film, she alluded to Mitch that she was a virgin and that formal is when she would finally have sex for the first time). Then Billie writes: NEVER HAVE I EVER CHEATED WITH MY BOYFRIEND'S BEST FRIEND. Mitch goes haywire. Blaire tries to explain that it was an accident, she was drunk, and it didn't mean anything; Billie begins to play a song on Spotify called How You Lie, Lie, Lie. Blaire tries to turn it off but the entire playlist is the song and it can't be clicked off. It plays as Blaire continues to defend herself, saying it was something quick. Blaire sobs and Mitch is furious. Billie says one of them is going to be the loser. Then all of a sudden, something prints on Adam's printer. He reads it to himself and then gets very uncomfortable and quiet. Mitch continues yelling at him but Adam is now stone-faced. They ask what the note says and he says he can't say. Mitch becomes paranoid. Then Blaire's computer sends something to her printer and she gets a piece of paper printed. She reads it and also gets very uncomfortable. Mitch begins to ask her questions, asking how deep their affair went. Blaire says they did it a second time for a few seconds just to see if there was anything between them. Billie begins to play a YouTube video on all their screens showing Adam and Blaire having sensual sex. Mitch begins to scream What does the note say? but they say they can't tell him. Mitch says: If you don't tell me, I'll hang up. Billie writes: If he hangs up, I'll kill him. He is just about to hang up when Blaire finally shows him the piece of paper. It says: IF YOU SHOW THIS TO THE OTHERS, I KILL ADAM. Immediately, Adam shoots himself in the head. His piece of paper is revealed: IF YOU SHOW THIS TO THE OTHERS, I KILL BLAIRE.Billie hints that Jess is next. Jess is told to lock herself in her bathroom and she obeys. Mitch and Blaire begin to scream about what should be done while a pop-up video comes up, a variation of the I love cams pop-up ad selling software that allows you to record webcam videos. Blaire and Mitch don't notice that one of the girls shown getting undressed on a cam is Blaire from the beginning of the film. Blaire goes on Google and looks for sites where you can chat with strangers, to ask for help. She goes on Chatroulette but nobody takes her seriously. She connects with men in Russia, two guys who are high, people who quickly change to a new person after she screams she needs help. This goes on for a while but she finally connects with a nice girl in the USA who is willing to help her. She asks her to call the police in Fresno, California and tell them to go to her friend's house. She types the address and presses Send, but it does not show up (Blaire doesn't notice). The girl calls 911 and talks to them about the situation and the need for police assistance. She is asked the address and Blaire types it again, not realizing it had disappeared the first time. The girl reads the address to the police and they say they're five minutes away. It worked. But then Blaire goes back to the Skype and on Jess's webcam, she is being killed with a hair straightener hot iron in her mouth. Blaire gets a notification -- Jess was tagged in a new pic. Its a photo of Jess... dead, with the hair straightener iron in her mouth with the words: SOMEONE FINALLY GOT JESS TO STFU.Now Blaire and Mitch are alone on Skype. There is silence and they seem to be safe when a buzzing sound is heard. However, it's just an alert from her calendar telling her to GO TO SLEEP TEST TOMORROW. She laughs about this with Mitch. But then Billie comes back and tells them she has one last question. WHO POSTED THE VIDEO? She says if they don't admit who did it, they will die. They swear they don't know. Laura messages Blaire on Facebook asking why she is protecting him. Laura says He didn't do anything. I promise. but then backspaces and says He did it. Immediately, Mitch stabs himself in the face with the large butcher knife he was using to flirt with Blaire in the first scene. Billie227/Laura begins to play a song with a sarcastic title ('I Hurt Too').Laura/Billie227 messages Blaire on Facebook and tells her that was the right thing to do. Blaire sobs for forgiveness, loading their friendship page on Facebook and scrolling down to show Laura all the pictures of them together as young girls. Blaire apologizes for them drifting apart. Laura writes: Drifted apart? Is that how you remember it? I think there's more to the story.... She tells Blaire that she's going to have to live with what she did and will never be able to live it down. Just then, a new YouTube video is posted on the RIP Laura Barns Facebook page, starting with Laura drunk on the ground covered in her own feces. But at the end, where it normally stops, the camera person films herself.... and it is revealed to be Blaire. She is laughing about what she just captured on camera and says: I can't believe I just got Laura Barns on tape. We got her. ('We got her' is the message Laura originally changed the text to on the Facebook Memorial form).All the comments come flooding in from other students watching the video, telling Blaire that she's the reason Laura killed herself, she's a monster, and suggesting that she KILL URSELF. Blaire is now getting the same kind of hate that drove Laura to suicide. All of a sudden, demon hands shut the laptop shut and the lights go out in Blaire's house. Then, a demon-faced teenaged girl (Laura) appears out of the darkness and lunges at the camera.End credits.
